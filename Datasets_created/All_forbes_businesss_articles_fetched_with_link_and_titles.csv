" China's visa and international travel restrictions have helped to keep Covid-19 in check yet become ... [+] a source of frustration for American companies in the country. (Photo by NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images) A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China released Friday found that nearly two-thirds of respondents want the U.S. and the Chinese governments to restore visa services and travel channels for business executives and their dependents as their top priority this year.  “As the pandemic continues well into its second year, the priorities for our member companies remain consistent, with the resumption of business travel at the top of the list,” said AmCham China Chairman Greg Gilligan in a statement.  Other top priorities for member companies this year include regularized government-to-government communication, and the removal of bilateral tariffs, the flash survey found.  “The state of the overall U.S.-China relationship is as important as ever to the business community, with members prioritizing concrete results and actions as a way to restore trust between the two countries,” Gilligan said.  The survey by Beijing-based Amcham China was conducted from August 23-25 to better understand how member companies perceive priorities for U.S.-China relations, Phase One Agreement implementation, and the current situation with respect to bilateral tariffs. Some 125 companies – of a total of nearly 1,000 members — submitted responses. The organization didn’t say which companies participated in the survey. Amcham China board members include include executives from Intel, Boeing, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs.  Other top issues include the removal of bilateral tariffs, restarting people-to-people exchanges, and a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping before year’s end. The two spoke by phone on Thursday, the White House said (see statement here).

"Katy (Awkwafina) and Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios. ©Marvel Studios 2021.  Walt Disney and Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) held up well in its second Fri-Sun frame. The Simu Liu/Awkwafina/Tony Leung-starring action fantasy grossed $34.1 million (-52.5%) for a new ten-day total of $143.915 million. That’s the biggest non-opening weekend gross since the $72 million second-weekend gross of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (following a $177 million debut weekend) in December 2019. Heck, among Fri-Sun opening weekends in 2020 and 2021, it sits behind only Bad Boys 3 ($62 million), Sonic the Hedgehog ($58 million), A Quiet Place part II ($47.5 million), F9 ($70 million) and Black Widow ($80 million). With $112 million overseas, it has earned $257.6 million worldwide. At this rate, it could pass $400 million global by the end.  The Destin Daniel Cretton-directed film’s $145.5 million cume (including $12.4 million in IMAX) makes it one of the biggest domestic earners of 2020 and 2021. Once it passes Sonic the Hedgehog ($146 million in February 2020), it’ll be behind just A Quiet Place part II ($160 million), F9 ($173 million), Black Widow ($183 million) and Bad Boys For Life ($204 million in January 2020). Unless it outright collapses, unlikely since the next two weeks are adult-skewing and/or adult-skewing flicks like Cry Macho, The Eyes of Tammy Faye and Dear Evan Hansen, it should be just over/under Black Widow by next Sunday, with a clear path (Venom: Let There Be Carnage opens on October 1) to being the first movie to pass $200 million domestic in 1.75 years. We haven’t had a year without at least one $200 million grosser since 1995 (led by the $171-$191 million-grossing Apollo 13, Batman Forever and Toy Story). We haven’t had as long a gap without such a film since the four years between Back to the Future ($210 million in 1985) and Batman ($251 million in 1989). More importantly, Shang-Chi is playing like a rock-solid MCU movie, in terms of raw grosses and weekend holds. The 52.5% drop is right in line with Captain America: The Winter Soldier (-56% after a $94 million debut), Guardians of the Galaxy (-54% after a $94 million opening), Thor: Ragnarok (-53% after a $123 million debut), Captain Marvel (-55% after a $154 million launch) and Ant-Man (-56% after a $58 million debut).  It’s playing like Thor: The Dark World, which opened with $96 million over a Fri-Mon Veteran’s Day debut in 2013 and fell 57% for a $146 million ten-day cume (for a $206 million domestic finish). However, Thor 2 (often held up as one of the worst MCU movies even if general audiences mostly thought it was “fine, whatever”) got shellacked in weekend three and four by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (a $158 million debut and then a $100 million Wed-Sun Thanksgiving gross) and Frozen (a $93 million Wed-Sun wide release debut over Thanksgiving). All due respect, I don’t expect similar-sized competition from Cry Macho and Dear Evan Hansen. Shang-Chi is “the danger” until Venom 2 on October 1 and No Time to Die on October 8.  By that time, along with Universal’s Halloween Kills on October 15 and (fingers-crossed-for-success) Warner Bros.’ Dune on October 22, it will have been around 45 days which is when the film may end up on Disney+ following the aforementioned 45-day exclusivity window. If Disney’s Shang-Chi ends up with even Thor: The Dark World or Ant-Man and the Wasp-level domestic grosses, it’ll be hard not to declare the film a “successful experiment” in terms of Bob Chapek wondering out loud what would have if they released an MCU movie exclusively in theaters but only for 45 days before arriving (presumably for free) on the streaming platform. While he may have hoped it would justify further direct-to-consumer releases, the results seem to skew in the “positive” for theatrical exclusivity.   Even half the once-standard 90-day theatrical window, Shang-Chi is performing awfully close to how it might have (at least domestically) in non-Covid circumstances. It’ll probably end its run with $215-$230 million domestic. Sure, it might have earned closer to Doctor Strange ($232 million) or The Winter Soldier ($259 million)-level grosses otherwise. However, A) it still might (Ant-Man legs from this point gets it to $247 million) and B) over/under $210 million is still a solid result for a “part one” MCU movie based on a far-less popular character mostly without conventional star power. Ditto Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer’s original, star-driven, high-concept Free Guy ($101.6 million as of tonight), will pass Jungle Cruise ($110 million along with whatever it earned on Premier Access) in a week or two.  With word that Disney will be giving a 30-day window for Encanto window (so that the WDA toon will be in theaters on Thanksgiving and Disney+ by Christmas) and a 45-day window for Eternals, The King’s Man, West Side Story and Nightmares and Dreamscapes, it’s hard not to look at this result as a brutal, if not quite fatal, blow to the “day and date Premier Access” hybrid release notion, at least for now. The high-profile Scarlett Johansson lawsuit may have played a role in that decision, but I digress. We may yet see Premier Access used as an earlier exclusive post-theatrical window. If (speculation alert) Bob Chapek and friends were hoping Shang-Chi would underperform to an extent to justify continued hybrid releases, then Shang-Chi is a glorious “failure.”  ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/12/box-office-shang-chi-continues-to-superhero-fatigue-past-250m-global/,Box Office: ‘Shang-Chi’ Continues To Superhero Fatigue Past $255M Global

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) As part of Fox News Channel’s coverage of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the U.S., the network aired former President Donald Trump’s visit to an NYPD police precinct in Manhattan, which featured Mr. Trump pivoting from reflecting on the terror and heroism of that day 20 years ago to his unhappiness over losing the 2020 presidential election. “We’re going to break away now,” said FNC anchor Arthel Neville, saying of Mr. Trump “he did not miss any opportunities to air grievances including claiming that the election was rigged, which is was not,” Neville said. “It has been proven in court multiple times. It has been proven that the election was not rigged by elected election officials.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: (L-R) Former President Bill Clinton, former President Barack ...

" U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer downplayed Democratic calls that he should step down now to ensure President Joe Biden can appoint a liberal successor, saying Sunday that while he understands their argument it’s only one of “many, many considerations” behind his decision to retire. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer participates in a panel at the Georgetown University Law ... [+] Center on April 21, 2014 in Washington, DC.  Upon being shown an interview of late Justice Antonin Scalia saying he doesn’t want to be replaced by a justice who tries to “[undo] everything I’ve tried to do,” Breyer said on Fox News Sunday he “see[s] the point” behind not wanting a conservative president to name his successor. The left-leaning Breyer, 83, said “probably in the background there’s something there” to that consideration, gesturing to his mind, but stressed there are “many, many considerations” behind his retirement, including the role of the court and ""institutional considerations.” Asked about calls by Democratic politicians for Breyer to retire, the justice said they are “entitled to their opinion” and “understand the political world much better than I...and there we are.” When asked why he didn’t retire at the end of this term, as many Democrats hoped he would, Breyer said only he didn’t retire “because I decided on balance I wouldn’t retire.” Breyer also dismissed questions regarding former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refusing to confirm Merrick Garland to the court ahead of the 2016 election but letting the Senate confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett just before the 2020 election, likening the question to “asking for the recipe to chicken a la king from the point of view of the chicken.” The justice chalked up McConnell’s decision to “the political environment,” and said he believes that if enough of the public want that reality to change or be modified, “it will be.” “I don’t intend to die on the court, I don’t think I’ll be there forever,” Breyer said. Breyer was also asked about potential reforms to the Supreme Court, which many progressives have pushed for in order to combat the high court’s conservative tilt and President Joe Biden has convened a commission to study. While Breyer pushed back against the idea of adding justices to the court, the justice signaled more openness to term limits, as some Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill to do. “I think you could do that,” Breyer said. “It should be a very long term, because you don’t want the judge who’s holding that term to start thinking about his next job. But it would make life easier for me.” Numerous Democrats have pushed for Breyer’s retirement from the Supreme Court in order to ensure his replacement can be confirmed while the party controls both the White House and Congress. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg declined to step down during Barack Obama’s presidency and was ultimately replaced by Trump nominee Barrett, and McConnell has suggested if the GOP retakes the Senate, he will likely be unwilling to confirm a Biden nominee to the court even if it’s a year before the 2024 election. The calls for Breyer’s retirement and sweeping reforms to the court have intensified in recent days after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to uphold Texas’ near-total ban on abortion, arguing in a September 1 ruling it was too soon to take action against the law despite its extreme restrictions on the procedure. “If [Breyer is] going to retire, it should be sooner rather than later,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said last week on CNN, noting if the court’s abortion decision “doesn’t cry out for that, I don’t know what does.” 18 Legal Scholars Urge Justice Breyer To Retire: ‘Best For The Country’ (Forbes) Supreme Court Refuses To Strike Down Texas Abortion Ban (Forbes) McConnell: Biden Won’t Get Supreme Court Pick In 2024 If GOP Wins Back Senate (Forbes) Stephen Breyer Has No Plan To Retire Yet From Supreme Court, He Says (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/09/12/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-dismisses-retirement-calls-says-politics-just-one-of-many-factors/,"Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer Dismisses Retirement Calls, Says Politics Just One Of ‘Many Factors’"
" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Sunday tore into progressives amid an ongoing conflict over various spending bills, warning of political backlash against House progressives if they sink a bipartisan infrastructure bill and labeling allegations from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) about his ties with oil lobbyists as “totally false.” WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 08: Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) is surrounded by reporters as he heads to a ... [+] vote in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol on June 8, 2021 in Washington, DC. The spotlight on Sen. Manchin grew even brighter after declaring that he will vote against the Democrats voting rights bill, the For the People Act, in his op-ed that was published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail over the weekend. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Manchin warned in a CNN interview that if progressives kill the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, they will have to tell constituents, “I don’t care about the roads and bridges, you don’t need it,” adding, “If they play politics with the needs of America… America will recoil.” The moderate West Virginia senator repeatedly said in the interview he opposes $3.5 trillion in social spending as part of Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill, a key demand of progressives in the House who say they are willing to vote down the infrastructure bill. Manchin refused to give an alternative figure, but floated $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion as possible viable alternatives, figures that would be unlikely to satiate the dozens of progressives demanding “robust” reconciliation spending. Manchin also took aim at a tweet from Ocasio-Cortez accusing him of “weekly huddles w/ Exxon,” calling the allegation “totally false” and stating, “They don’t have weekly meetings. I keep my door open for everybody.” Manchin called the tweet “just awful” and accused Ocasio-Cortez of “continu[ing] to divide, divide, divide,” adding that he doesn’t “know the young lady that well” and “she’s just speculating and saying things.” Forbes has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez’s office for comment. While the bipartisan bill – focused on “core” infrastructure like roads and bridges, broadband and mass transit – passed the Senate in August and is set to be voted on by the House on September 27, House Democrats are rushing to craft the reconciliation bill – which is set to include spending on “human infrastructure” including Medicare, climate change and affordable housing. 51. That’s the number of votes Senate Democrats need to pass a budget reconciliation bill, including Vice President Kamala Harris as a tiebreaker. With the Senate divided evenly, that makes Manchin’s support pivotal. By the same token, House progressives insist they have the votes to sink the infrastructure package in the House – where Democrats hold a narrow 8-seat majority – even if some Republicans sign on. While Manchin made no secret of his disdain for progressives’ maneuvering on infrastructure, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a champion of the $3.5 trillion price tag, struck a far more conciliatory tone in a subsequent CNN interview. “We’re talking about Mr. Manchin, but the real outrage is not one Republican is prepared” to support reconciliation, he said, telling anchor Dana Bash, “Don’t make this a Bernie Sanders vs. Joe Manchin issue.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/12/tensions-erupt-as-manchin-slams-aoc-warns-america-will-recoil-at-progressives-infrastructure-threats/,"Tensions Erupt As Manchin Slams AOC, Warns ‘America Will Recoil’ At Progressives’ Infrastructure Threats"
"The Oregon Ducks shocked the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus yesterday, 35-28. Shock was the operative word in that it’s increasingly rare for PAC-12 teams to beat prominent, out-of-conference teams. How things have changed, which is where this piece will begin.  It was a fall Sunday in 1994, or maybe 1995. The actual year really isn’t important. What’s important for the purposes of this argument is that UCLA football wasn’t doing particularly well. A little blurb in the Chicago Tribune sports page asked something along the lines of “What happened to UCLA football? They’re all in the NFL.” The Tribune went on to list the college programs with the most NFL players. Up top was USC with 38, followed by UCLA with 37. Or maybe it was UCLA with 38, and USC with 37? A search through old clippings didn’t unearth this one, but the memory for what some would deem worthless facts is long.  What’s important about the blurb is what it said about the state of what was then PAC-10 football. Hard as it may be for readers to imagine today, the PAC-10 of the 1990s had few peers. Certainly from a player standpoint.  Going back further in time to the announcement of the 1992 NFL Pro Bowl, the PAC-10 led all conferences with 17 players selected, followed by the Big 10 (11), the ACC (8), the SEC (7), and the now defunct Southwest Conference with 6 players named to the game. Which team provided the most talent? You probably guessed it: USC. 8 Southern Cal alums were voted into the game by fellow players, and the next closest was Miami with 4, followed by Florida with 3, Alabama with 2, Notre Dame with 1, and perennial power Texas with 0.  Another clipping from around the mid ‘90s looked at the NFL Draft. The 10 team PAC-10 had 36 players selected, followed by the then 12 team SEC with 34. The 1992 NFL draft kicked off with Washington’s Steve Emtman at #1, after which 15 of the first 63 players taken were from the PAC-10. Fast forward to the 1996 draft when USC’s Keyshawn Johnson was taken at #1 by the New York Jets, a USA Today graphic ahead of draft day listed the most drafted football conference of the 1990s up until then. The PAC-10 was in the lead by mid-decade with 215 players taken, followed by the SEC with 199, the Big 10 with 176, the ACC with 138….To this day USC leads all schools in terms of total first round draft picks.  As the 21st century began, a Wall Street Journal survey of the major conferences still showed the PAC-10 up top with the most NFL players. One guesses Playboy no longer does its college football preview, but in the 1990s it routinely made a case for PAC-10 supremacy. Paraphrasing one year’s blurb, “We say it every year and this year is no different: the PAC-10 is the best conference in college football.”  Oh well, that was then. Nowadays the PAC-12 is awful. It’s irrelevant. Worse, it can’t even add good teams in the right away. You see, in the 1990s Colorado was a national football power. A mid ‘90s draft had the Buffs at the top with Florida State. 10 players selected each. How things change. Colorado was part of the Big 8, or maybe Big 12 then. Now it’s a forgotten program in a conference that’s largely forgotten. So what happened? The speculation here is that economic progress is what happened.  About the progress, it’s a good thing. Call it essential. At the same time, it perhaps exposed weaknesses of the PAC-12 that were less visible in decades past.  Arguably the PAC-12’s demise began with a development in Washington that was very good: the late 1970s deregulation of air travel. Before then, air travel was very expensive and routes were planned by the Civil Aeronautics Board.  Pricey flying very much meant that travel to college football games by distant alums to Ann Arbor, Austin, Baton Rouge, Columbus, Greenville, Stillwater, Tallahassee, and Tuscaloosa wasn’t as much of a thing. As recently as the late 1980s and early 1990s, weekend travel of the one and two-day variety marked you as relatively “jet set.” Now? It’s nothing. It’s the norm. Even better, 7, 14, and 21-day advance fares offering lower prices are very much part of the past too.  All of this has resulted in a surge of weekend visitors to once expensive and hard-to-get-to college towns. Wolverine, Longhorn, Tiger, Buckeye, Tiger (Clemson), Cowboy, Seminole, and Crimson Tide fans were always passionate, but it’s increasingly inexpensive for them to be passionate in person at more than one game. No doubt the Mack Brown era at Texas rightly increased fan interest in the team, but it’s no surprise that the biggest crowds at Memorial Stadium came after Brown’s tenure.  Cheap travel quite simply made charming college towns a fall destination, and a regular one at that. Compare this to where PAC-12 teams largely play games. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Seattle and the rest are surely desirable destinations, but most are not compact. Worse, the non-compact nature of PAC-12 cities versus college towns doesn’t as much make them routine destinations for fans. While hotels like the Abernathy (Clemson) and Atherton (Stillwater) are among the locations geared specifically for college football weekends, where would you stay if heading back to USC for a game in order to see old friends? What about UCLA when it’s remembered that the Rose Bowl in mostly normal traffic is an hour from Westwood?  None of the above much mattered when air travel was expensive, and when city schools could count on local alums to partially fill their stadiums, but it does when travel is cheap. While UCLA was reduced to giving away tickets for its recent game against LSU (please don’t even ask attendance for Hawaii the previous week), and while USC maybe (at times) played in front of 50,000 against San Jose State the same day, southern and Midwestern schools in real college towns had stadiums that were packed. This sad truth has to have had, and will have an impact on recruits. USC and UCLA surely have die-hard fans, but if they don’t already live in Los Angeles, what’s the point of traveling to Los Angeles for games that aren’t really played anywhere near where alums might gather? There’s something missing in the PAC-12 atmosphere scenario that isn’t missing in the college towns where other traditional football powers reside.  Which brings us to economic growth more broadly. In decades past, Austin was a college town. So was Columbus. Greenville, which neighbors Clemson, was largely unheard of. This arguably aided schools out west located in major cities. Not only did USC, UCLA, Washington and others offer big-time programs, but economic opportunity with Trojan, Bruin and Husky alums in the aftermath was substantial. It still is.  At the same time, the gap has in a sense shrunk. Austin is now a major commercial center, it’s said in Columbus that the city is thick with former Buckeyes working good jobs, to visit Greenville today is to see abundant growth. While California can still claim the greatest number of billionaires and centimillionaires, the cost of living there along with the tax burden of living there has led to the migration of some of the talent outside the state. More broadly, the U.S. economy has boomed since the 1970s, and the boom has been more widespread than the media would have people believe. The view here is that this happy truth has similarly made the genius of heading west less obvious. Opportunity is everywhere.  And the opportunity is colorblind. This speaks to the beauty of competition that by its very name is defined by merit. Race goes out the window. While it used to be that talented black athletes in the south either went north or west out of necessity, this is no longer the case. Some in the south believe to this day that USC tailback Sam Cunningham did more for southern integration than even MLK (Cunningham starred on a well-integrated Trojan team that beat a nearly all-white Alabama team badly, at Birmingham’s Legion Field, in 1970). Whatever the answer, the love of winning has easily trumped the racism that formerly prevailed in the south, and that pushed many of the top athletes north or west for college.  Back to growth once again, while it’s been broad, it’s produced an abundance of billionaires and centimillionaires in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. This is a great thing. But consider what you do if you’re head coach at USC, UCLA, Stanford, Cal, or Washington. How do you recruit assistants with pay in the $300,000-$600,000 range to cities where the latter buys you quite a bit less than nothing? Check out home prices in Palo Alto, or in the locales neighboring Westwood, or what it costs to find a living space sort of near USC.  Contrast the above with Austin, Columbus, Greenville and other glorious college towns. No doubt Austin in particular is starting to see a Californication of its housing prices, but at the same time there’s a reason 8 Californians move to the Texas capital each day. Expensive as it is, housing prices are still much less than equal. Well paid as college assistants are today, the gap between what a $500,000 income affords you in Ann Arbor, Columbus and Greenville versus Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle is wide.  To which some will understandably reply that PAC-12 schools can arguably lay claim to the nation’s richest alums of any major conference, so why not just pay up for coaching talent? It’s a good question. One Stanford alum actually did buy houses near campus that would house assistants who couldn’t otherwise afford to live anywhere near the campus. Stanford should be a model.  Still, it speaks to a problem that wasn’t as visible in the past: who knows why, but it seems PAC-12 alums aren’t as football passionate as grads of other schools. Obviously the list of billionaire grads from schools like USC and Stanford is endless, but their money is in most ways less evident in a football sense. Contrast that with a visit to a beautiful campus like Oklahoma State’s, where the spending by the late billionaire T. Boone Pickens on the football team was much more than abundant. It seems the rich alums at ACC, Big 12 and SEC schools in particular are much more football focused than are PAC-12 alums. And it shows. If anyone doubts this, visit Auburn, Clemson, Tuscaloosa, and once again, Stillwater. Some may single out Oregon, and the spending of Phil Knight on the football team and sports in general, and they have a point. Oregon, with an alum like Knight, and a remote college campus in Eugene, may paradoxically be the PAC-12 school best situated to thrive in the new world.  About what’s been said, it’s all a speculation. It seems positive economic changes exposed a relative lack of passion within PAC-12 alums, and this truth will become more and more apparent as travel becomes easier and easier. Throw in cost of living near urban schools, along with football interest among alums of urban schools, and it may help to explain the PAC-12’s demise.  No doubt all conferences go through up and down periods, the ups and downs can often be repaired by the arrival of one or two good coaching hires, but a lack of fan interest married to a lack of an intangible Saturday atmosphere is harder to repair. The bet here is that PAC-12 football will get worse before it gets better, assuming it gets better.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2021/09/12/why-is-pac-12-football-so-awful-an-economic-progress-case-for-its-demise/,Why Is PAC-12 Football So Awful?

"Malignant Warner Bros. is continuing its commitment to release all its movies, big or small, on HBO Max at the same time as in theaters, and that’s now the case for James Wan’s Malignant, out now. Wan’s new horror entry, after giving us the Saw universe and The Conjuring universe, may not spawn yet another universe, but it has given us what I would consider one of the best new horror villains in the genre in at least the last decade, if not longer.  That would be Gabriel, but before we talk about Gabriel, we are going to need some serious spoiler warnings, as his reveal is the main twist of Malignant.  One of my main problems with Malignant was that the movie had seemed to spoil itself from the opening minutes. For the first two thirds, we see a mysterious figures creeping around, murdering people, and we know that he is intimately tied to Madison. The horrifying intro, the references to childhood reconstructive surgery, and the repeated phrase “cut the cancer out” seemed to give a pretty clear picture of where this was heading. The idea I had in my head the whole film was that Gabriel was previously a conjoined twin with Madison. He was “cut out” and then presumably, discarded, but managed to survive, grow into a misshapen adult, then sets out to get revenge on those who wronged him.  The other option? An even lamer twist, where Gabriel died and it’s been Madison hallucinating his existence the whole time and she’s the real killer. I’ve seen that movie before. But the actual answer is a mix of both of these, stranger and better than either. The reveal is that Gabriel was not a fully conjoined twin, but a weird, half-absorbed fetus that shared a torso and half a brain with his sister. Most of him is cut away, but his face, and the shared brain, remain inside Madison’s skull. Malignant So, Madison is sort of the killer, and yet the glorious reveal is that when “awakened” Gabriel pushes his face out the back of her head, and controls Madison’s body…backwards, dislocating her joints and moving her around like some sort of demonic puppet. Gabriel, I forgot to mention, also effectively has super powers, the ability to blow up electronics and with super strength, speed and agility.  The end result? Gabriel, in “full backwards form” is one of the most insane horror villains I’ve ever seen on screen, which creates some of the most insane action sequences in a horror movie I’ve ever seen, like when he singlehandedly murders an entire holding cell of women and then almost all the cops outside. I really want to watch a documentary to watch how any of this was filmed. How much of this was CGI, prosthetics and stunt work? It’s been a long time since I’ve watched a movie and been genuinely perplexed by how something was filmed, but that’s how wild Gabriel’s design is. The catch with Gabriel? This seems like a trick you can only pull once. The reveal of his true form is the highlight of the film, so I’m not really sure what you do for a potential sequel here. Though we know James Wan loves his sequels, so I would not be surprised to see one. He’s far more creative than me, however, so I’m sure he has more ideas. I just want to see more Gabriel, however he comes back. Follow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, God Rolls.

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for iHeartMedia) Two weeks ago, BTS’s “Butter” finally fell off the U.K. singles chart, slipping from No. 69 to somewhere below the No. 100 mark. Last frame, the tune returned, and not just to the ranking, but to the top 40 region, as it reappeared at No. 32. Now, it’s down again to No. 62, and while it could vacate the tally in just a few days, perhaps for good, the cut has made history by spending one more turn on the list. “Butter” has now lived on the U.K. singles chart for 13 weeks, which has turned out to be a very lucky sum for the group. With their single spending one more spin on the ranking, the band breaks out of a tie with another one of the biggest vocal groups to hail from their home country. Last time around, BTS’s “Butter” was tied with Blackpink and Dua Lipa’s ""Kiss and Make Up"" as the fifth-longest-charting songs in U.K. history by South Korean musicians, with a dozen weeks spent on the ranking apiece. Now, BTS has broken out of that match, and “Butter” holds in fifth place alone. The longest-charting song by any South Korean musical act in U.K. history remains Pinkfong’s “Baby Shark,” which has thus far racked up an incredible 72 weeks on the tally. That number isn’t just enough to make it the most successful track by a soloist or band (or brand, as some might refer to Pinkfong) from the Asian nation, but one of the longest-running winners ever. Psy’s “Gangnam Style,” which is still the only track by a South Korean act in U.K. history to hit No. 1, is the only other tune by a musician from the Asian territory to live on the ranking for at least a year. The insanely viral hit went on to spend an incredible 55 frames somewhere on the 100-spot tally. BTS’s “Dynamite” sits in third place on the ranking of the tunes by South Korean musicians that have racked up the most weeks on the U.K. singles chart, as it earned 27 stays on the roster. In between “Dynamite” and BTS’s other smash “Butter” is Psy’s “Gentleman,” which is the fourth-longest-charting track among all releases by South Korean acts. That latter title managed 19 weeks on the tally.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/12/bts-break-a-tie-with-blackpink-to-score-the-fifth-longest-charting-korean-song-in-uk-history/,BTS Break A Tie With Blackpink To Score The Fifth-Longest-Charting Korean Song In U.K. History
" As former President Donald Trump potentially prepares to launch a presidential bid for 2024, a new CNN/SSRS poll finds that while a majority of Republicans want the ex-president to lead the GOP, they’re evenly divided on whether having him at the top of the ticket will help the party retake the White House. Former U.S. President Donald Trump addresses supporters at a rally on August 21 in Cullman, Alabama. ... [+]  The poll, conducted August 3 to September 7 among 2,119 U.S. adults, found 63% of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents believe Trump should lead the party, versus 37% who say he shouldn’t. Only 51% believe the party has a “better chance of retaking the presidency if Trump is the nominee,” however, while 49% say a different candidate would be better. That share is down from 78% who said in March 2019 that the party would have an advantage with Trump in the 2020 election. Support for Trump is highest among Republicans without a college degree (69% believe he should lead the party), conservatives (72%) and self-identified Republicans (71%), while it’s lower among those with a college degree (49%), moderates (49%) and Republican-leaning Independents (51%). Approximately 60% say support for Trump and a belief that he won the 2020 election—which there is no evidence to support—“are at least a somewhat important part of what being a Republican means to them.” More Republicans place importance on opposing Democratic policies (69%), supporting GOP politicians in Congress (81%), holding conservative values (85%) and wanting the federal government to have less power (86%), however. The poll also looked at the midterm elections in 2022, which found 45% of registered voters are likely to vote for the Democratic congressional candidate and 44% for the GOP candidate. The poll found 28% are “extremely enthusiastic” about voting in 2022—up from 18% who said the same in 2017 about the 2018 midterms—with Republicans slightly more enthusiastic (30% extremely enthusiastic versus 26% for Democrats). Trump has been hinting at a 2024 run and laying the groundwork for it in recent weeks, scheduling rallies in key states like Iowa and Florida and hiring staffers for his political action committee in Iowa. Trump advisor Jason Miller said the chances of the ex-president running are “between 99 and 100 percent,” and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) recently claimed Trump was “about ready to announce” a run. Trump himself appeared to hint at a run on Saturday when he visited a police station in New York City. “Oh, that’s a tough question,” Trump jokingly said in response to a question about whether he’d run in 2024. “Actually, for me it’s an easy question.” Republicans’ enthusiasm for Trump running doesn’t extend to Americans overall, with 60% of respondents in a recent Quinnipiac poll believing Trump’s potential 2024 bid would be “bad for the country.” The ex-president could still have a chance at retaking the White House, however, as an Emerson College poll conducted August 30 - September 1 found 47% of respondents favored Trump in a potential 2024 matchup against President Joe Biden, versus 46% who would vote for Biden.

Sunday Night Football will be live streamed via NBC Sports. Monday Night Football will stream on WatchESPN.  Week 1’s Sunday slate begins at 1 p.m. ET with nine games starting simultaneously. A handful of highly-anticipated contests are included in this flurry of kickoffs, including a marquee AFC showdown between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Buffalo Bills.  The Bills will be looking to get off on the right foot after coming up short in last year’s AFC Championship Game, while the Steelers are hoping to prove they are still a threat after a late season collapse and early playoff exit marred their 2020 campaign.  The late afternoon timeslot may be even more thrilling than the early one. Although it will only see four games taking place within it, they feature plenty of clubs poised to contend 2021.  Fans will get to see a rematch of last year’s riveting AFC Divisional round clash between the Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs, the latest chapter of the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins’ longstanding AFC East rivalry and a high-profile NFC battle between the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints. Week 1’s marquee matchup is between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. These NFC playoff hopefuls will finally have an opportunity to see how their major offseason adjustments panned out when they go head-to-head in front of a nationally televised audience.    Both the Rams and Bears were busy this offseason, making several key roster adjustments after falling short in the playoffs. Both teams will showcase new starting quarterbacks for the 2021 NFL season, a swap that most of their respective fanbases welcomed after inadequate QB play submarined their chances last season.   Chicago significantly upgraded its situation under center after slumping through 2020 with Mitchell Trubisky and Nick Foles. The Bears not only signed veteran Andy Dalton in free agency, but also traded up in the draft to acquire a potential franchise quarterback in Justin Fields. The organization is giving Dalton the nod tonight after declaring him the Week 1 starter, but Fields had an impressive preseason and should see the field sooner than later.  The Rams made a bold move to jettison former starting quarterback Jared Stafford and a package of draft picks to the Detroit Lions, returning veteran Matthew Stafford. LA brass is hoping Stafford can elevate the offense, rounding out a team that ranked No. 1 in the league on defense last year.  Oddsmakers have installed the Rams as 7.5-point chalk for this Sunday Night Football opener. The team’s defensive prowess may have a taken a hit with the loss of coordinator Brandon Staley—now the head coach of the in-town rival Chargers—but it’s unlikely this star-studded group takes a significant step back with Raheem Morris now assuming his duties.  Bears quarterback Andy Dalton has the unenviable task of taking on the Rams defense when he makes ... [+] his debut as Chicago's new starting quarterback in Week 1. LA returned some of the game’s top defensive players, a group that includes Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey amongst others. They should have little issue succeeding against a Chicago foe, especially given the Bears have some serious question marks along the offensive line.  PFF ranked Chicago’s O-line as the No. 28 unit in the league going into 2021. The site noted the loss of stalwart tackles Charles Leno Jr. and Bobby Massie as a reason for this low standing. While the team did secure a quality rookie in Teven Jenkins, they have little else in the way of proven assets in the offensive trenches. That, coupled with a signal-caller attempting to adjust to a new system, simply isn’t a recipe for success against an unforgiving defense. For that reason, lay the points with the Rams. Los Angeles is poised to make a massive improvement on offense after ranking just No. 22 in the league last year in points scored. Stafford has plenty of talent surrounding him, a supporting cast that includes Robert Woods, Cooper Kupp and DeSean Jackson, some of the best weapons the 33-year-old quarterback has played with during his career.  This Sunday Night Football showdown could start slow as both sides shake some of the rust, but ultimately the Rams will pull away for a double-digit victory. Their roster is significantly stronger than Chicago’s and the talent discrepancy will clear by the end of this contest.

"AEW could be bringing in Bray Wyatt later this month. (Credit: Gary Gershoff/WireImage) Former WWE stars Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman may have found their new homes. According to a report from the latest Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t SEScoops), Wyatt—real name Windham Rotunda—is likely headed to Impact Wrestling or AEW and could debut for the latter on the September 29th edition of AEW Dynamite while Strowman—real name Adam Scherr—is “in talks” with Impact about a possible deal with the company. Wyatt and Strowman were surprisingly released by WWE earlier this year despite being pushed as two of the company’s biggest stars over the past several years. WWE’s shocking decision to cut ties with Wyatt was reportedly due to “budget cuts,” and Strowman was also let go because of his massive salary but also due to the internal belief that he was “two years past his peak.” WWE, of course, dropped the ball with both stars on a number of occasions during their runs with the company. Strowman should have won his first title when he was red hot in 2017, and the ideal time and place for that would have been at No Mercy that year when he faced Brock Lesnar. Wyatt—under his innovative “The Fiend” character—should have been booked as a modern day version of The Undertaker, but his gimmick quickly ran out of steam thanks to an incredibly underwhelming feud with Seth Rollins and a short-sighted loss to Goldberg. Both Wyatt and Strowman were booked so badly in recent years, however, that WWE decided to cut both stars loose despite their obvious potential to be main eventers or even world champions elsewhere. Wyatt, in particular, had a really strong fan base in WWE, where he was once its No. 1 merchandise seller ahead of the likes of Roman Reigns and Becky Lynch. Wyatt’s undeniable popularity has unsurprisingly made him a hot commodity upon the pending expiration of his 90-day non-compete clause. There have long been plenty of rumblings about Wyatt potentially jumping to AEW, but there are also just as many questions about how well Wyatt would fit in there or whether AEW should even consider signing him given that the company has recently brought in a number of ex-WWE names. The widespread belief is that, if Wyatt does end up in AEW, he could take over as the leader of The Dark Order, which would be a natural fit for him given Dark Order’s recent issues and how close Wyatt was to the late Brodie Lee, the former leader of The Dark Order. Impact Wrestling might be a better overall fit for Wyatt in part because he’d be one of the few big fish in a small pond there, but Impact has lost a lot of steam in recent years due largely to the rise of AEW. Strowman, despite being one of pro wrestling’s best big men, doesn’t seem to be a particularly great fit for AEW at the moment, either. AEW is jam-packed with a number of ex-WWE names, and Strowman—who appears to be going under the new name of “Titan” or something similar—is limited in what he can do both in the ring and as a character. Thus, Impact would actually be a great place for him to reinvent himself and potentially improve his overall abilities as a performer. It remains to be seen, though, if WWE will have interest in either star given AEW’s obvious momentum upswing. WWE reportedly had a case of seller’s remorse not long after the company let Strowman go and expressed interest in re-signing the behemoth as AEW continued to scoop up a plethora of ex-WWE standouts. Wyatt and/or Strowman returning to WWE seems highly unlikely given their unceremonious releases, however, and the smart money is on the ultra-talented Wyatt making his way to AEW like so many ex-WWE stars have while Strowman looks to reinvigorate his career in Impact.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2021/09/12/bray-wyatt-reportedly-could-debut-for-aew-soon-braun-strowman-in-talks-with-impact/,"Bray Wyatt Reportedly Could Debut For AEW Soon, Braun Strowman ‘In Talks’ With Impact"
"BRISTOL, TENNESSEE - JULY 15: Fans wearing face masks shop for race memorabilia prior to the NASCAR ... [+] Cup Series All-Star Race at Bristol Motor Speedway on July 15, 2020 in Bristol, Tennessee. The NASCAR All-Star Race was moved from Charlotte Motor Speedway to Bristol Motor Speedway due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. NASCAR allowed up to 30,000 fans to attend the race. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) In the early days of NASCAR if fans wanted any sort of souvenir or collectable they had to go to the track and hope their favorite driver was selling t-shirts or handing out hero cards with their picture on it. By the 1990s however as the legendary Dale Earnhardt Sr. rose to prominence, he started taking control of his merchandise licensing his likeness, his car number and even his signature. It created a revenue stream for him and soon others took notice.  By the turn of the century the NASCAR merchandise market had exploded, and fans could buy anything from hats, to diecast cars, cooking utensils, chef’s aprons, holiday ornaments, toys and of course t-shirts. With the advent of ecommerce fans can now get their favorite drivers merchandise online or at the track at a huge midway crowded with merchandise haulers representing just about every driver, team, and manufacturer.  As everything in the world evolves, so does NASCAR. The sport is now making its first tentative steps into the world of the non-fungible token or NFT. The popularity of the NFT has grown recently as they became a way for buyers to purchase digital artwork. Most often NFTs are purchased using cryptocurrency, but unlike cryptocurrency an NFT has a unique digital signature which means it can’t be traded one for one like Bitcoin. The NFT is a digital collectible (such as an image or video) that is officially licensed and recorded on the blockchain to show proof of ownership. An NFT is created from a digital object representing an item. Major sports leagues like the NBA, NFL, and the NHL have jumped on the NFT train selling the tokens for merchandise, video clips, and more.  Speedway Motorsports will offer fans 10,000 commemorative ticket NFTs.  Speedway Motorsports, which owns eight tracks, seven that host NASCAR races, announced this week that they will enter the world of the NFT. In a partnership with GigLabs, Speedway Motorsports has created RaceDayNFT.com which will sell NASCAR themed NFTs. The new marketplace will launch with a collection of 10,000 commemorative ticket NFTs, including 500 randomly selected golden ticket NFTs for the upcoming race at Bristol Motor Speedway, one of the tracks in the Speedway Motorsports portfolios. In a press release Speedway Motorsports emphasized that the commemorative tickets won’t be good for admission to the race on Sept. 18, but instead a digital object fans will own. The first of the commemorative tickets will be available for free, with more artwork to be offered shortly after the Monday debut of the platform. Those added NFTs will be for sale and include a limited edition NFT fans can purchase. There will also be an At The Track NFT that fans can claim on property during the race weekend at Bristol. Finally, there will be two collectible “Winners Editon” NFTs issued after the race: One for the race winner, and an identical version that will be auctioned off.  Could the NASCAR NFTs being issued by Speedway Motorsports be something that will not only create a new revenue stream, but something picked up by the rest of the sport? NBA’s Top Shot is the platform that league uses to market its NFTs. During its beta period the platform handled more than three million transactions and $460 million in sales.  Fanatics a sports merchandising company which owns the rights to NBA, NFL, and the NHL merchandise started an NFT company earlier this year called Candy Digital. Fanatics also owns the rights to much of the NASCAR merchandise on the market. If the Speedway Motorsports NFTs are as successful as what has been seen in other sports, is would be no surprise if they soon become the norm across NASCAR.  No doubt, Dale Earnhardt Sr. would approve.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregengle/2021/09/12/nfts-are-coming-to-nascar-and-they-could-change-the-collectibles-market-in-the-sport/,NFTs Are Coming To Nascar And They Could Change The Collectibles Market In The Sport
"In the weeks before the deadline of August 31, hundreds of people were evacuated from Afghanistan. The evacuation, as challenging as it was, was additionally affected by bombing that left hundreds of people dead or injured, and resulted in the premature termination of some evacuation efforts. Hundreds of people who wish to leave remained in Afghanistan and now fear for their lives. Among them are generations of human rights defenders including judges, lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, those who spent years working to make Afghanistan a country that affirms and protects the human rights of all. Now that the Taliban has taken over, they feel that a target has been placed on their back and that it is a matter of time before the Taliban will knock on their doors. All those wishing to leave the country should be allowed to do so. However, opportunities are very limited.  Journalists from the Etilaatroz newspaper, Nemat Naqdi, 28, a video journalist, left and Taqi ...

(Photo credit: MARCUS YAM / LOS ANGELES TIMES) Shortly before the August deadline, the Taliban stated that foreigners wishing to leave would be able to do so but the Taliban was very clear that they wanted Afghan talents to remain home and “work in their own specialist areas.”  However, this promise should not be taken at face value. The Taliban do not mean all talents. Female talents are most likely to be confined to their homes. Indeed, shortly after the takeover, the Taliban proclaimed that all female workers were to stay home, for the time being, as justified by security situation. Subsequently, universities received communique that they should segregate female and male students and continue education separately. To name only a few examples.  The threat faced by human rights defenders is real. Among human rights defenders, female lawyers and judges are at particular risk. Not only because of their sex and daring to have high-flying careers. No. It is because many of them were involved in the trials of Taliban fighters. Now that prisoners are being released, including those who they put in jail, they have a constant target on their backs. Women in any position of power, whether judges, lawyers, politicians, who are spared, would be confined to their homes and dependant on a male escort to leave the house. Women protesting against the over-night decline of women’s rights in the country are facing Taliban fighters using whips to silent them.  Journalists, especially those shedding light on the dire situation in the country, are at risk as well. Two journalists from the Kabul-based media outlet Etilaat-e Roz, Taqi Daryabi and Nemat Naqdi, were reportedly detained and attacked for covering a women’s protest.  Human rights defenders in all shape and forms are seen as the enemy of the Taliban because they fight for what the Taliban do not agree with - human rights.  In the U.K., Baroness Kennedy QC, a distinguished barrister and director of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute, took on the challenge to assist the human rights defenders in Afghanistan. As she stated “I am working with a large team of pro-bono lawyers in the United Kingdom and across the world to save the brave female Judges, lawyers, women's rights activists, and human rights defenders. They are in immense danger and need help immediately.” She called upon the international community to provide them with help.  What can be done? Resettlement. Many human rights defenders will not be able to stay in Afghanistan as staying means certain death. As such, they need resettlement to a safe country. However, currently, very few countries are willing to come forward and take them in. As such we run the risk that a whole generation of Afghan human rights defenders may perish at the hands of the Taliban. If they do, a brighter future for Afghanistan will not be achieved in our lifetimes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2021/09/12/the-whole-generations-of-human-rights-defenders-may-perish-in-afghanistan/,The Whole Generations Of Human Rights Defenders May Perish In Afghanistan
"VW ID.Life Europe’s automakers are relentlessly producing the wrong kind of electric car, but Volkswagen showed it might move in the right direction by showing its mass-market aimed ID.Life concept at the IAA Mobility 2021 show in Munich. The industry is trying to emulate the all-round abilities of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and SUVs, but this isn’t possible if European Union carbon dioxide (CO2) regulations are to be met. The more the industry tries to make electric cars achieve ICE-type high-speed cruising levels and long-range, the more electric CO2 advantages are diluted with ever bigger batteries and the polluting palaver notched up along the way. The curse of chip supply restraints echoed around the show. There was much talk of autonomous transportation, robotaxis and of course electrification. If the electric revolution is to be achieved, the industry must accept the fact that things have changed. Regular electric cars won’t be able to perform all the roles ICE ones can, but they can provide a huge amount of utility for shopping, commuting, school runs, and city, urban and rural travel. Up to maybe 90% of real-world requirements? You can forget long-range high-speed cruising with current battery technology, but if car makers design a seriously affordable little car that can do all this – say under €10,000 ($12,000) – the buyers will come running, governments will be able to put away their subsidy cheque books, taxpayers can breathe a sigh of relief, and the electric car revolution will be up and running. The trouble is, the little ID.Life will cost an estimated €25,000 ($29,600 after tax) when it appears for sale in 2025, and that’s about twice as much as an entry level car should cost. VW, which has said EU regulations to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2030 will make it impossible to sell profitably its current cheapest models like the Up and Polo, but perhaps by then battery costs will have been seriously shaved. Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW, in front of a BMW i Vision Circular concept car during a press ... [+] presentation at the International Motor Show (IAA), on September 6, 2021 in Munich. (Photo by TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) Barclays Equity Research said VW was focusing on the “wider mobility space” with the ID.Life concept, which it thought would sell from around €20,000. “(The ID.Life) focusses on sustainability with recycled and natural materials being used for key components. According to VW it brings electric mobility to the masses with the low price point and mainly focusses on urban mobility,” Barclays said in a report. The price sounds a bit steep for the masses though.   And VW warned that any near-term acceleration in the introduction of electric vehicles might be in danger of stalling because of battery “constraints”, presumably including battery supply, and the actual ability to produce required performance. This follows a warning from Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Duisberg, Germany. “After the chip crisis, from 2024, an increasing global battery cell bottleneck must be expected,” Dudenhoeffer said.  News from Toyota in Tokyo, one of many global manufacturers that didn’t attend the IAA (for Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung) Mobility show, that it planned to fully enter the all-electric car race with a spending plan of $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop batteries and factories to build them and 15 battery electric vehicles by 2025, must have shaken up the participants. These were mainly German, with a few outsiders like Renault and its value subsidiary Dacia.  Toyota has sounded reticent about joining the race to go all-electric, preferring to concentrate for the time being on hybrid cars and SUVs, and a notable investment in hydrogen fuel cells. The next big advancement in battery technology will be solid-state and Toyota has been quietly investing in this. Solid-state batteries are expected take battery power to a new level because they will likely be much more energy dense, allow faster charging, cost 50% less and not be prone to occasionally bursting into flames. Big car makers outside Japan must be having nightmares that Toyota might well suddenly announce a big technology breakthrough that will leave their lithium-ion technology stranded.  Ola Kaellenius, CEO of Daimler AG, speaks during the presentation of the Mercedes EQE (Photo by ... [+] TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) Meanwhile attendees at the show revealed a succession of either bloated, high-priced electric cars, or variations on the current theme of what effectively are required - town cars – but which cost about twice as much as their utility would suggest.  Mercedes announced 3 possible all-electric models, the EQE sedan, the EQG version of the G-Wagon, and EQS Maybach, with the former likely to come to market in 2022, priced from around €70,000 after tax in Germany ($83,000). Barclays Equity Research described the Mercedes electric line-up as one of the strongest of the German premium manufacturers. The EQE will compete with the Audi A6 e-tron and boasts a range of 660 kilometres (410 miles) and over-the-air (OTA) computer system updates like Tesla

" Simcere Pharmeutical's headquarters in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing. Simcere Pharmaceutical Group was relatively early among Chinese companies to go public in the United States — it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007 with a market capitalization of nearly $1 billion after raising $226 million in an IPO. “I still remember that as a lot of money,” Chairman Ren Jinsheng smiled in an interview at the company’s headquarters in the eastern China city of Nanjing.    Yet it didn’t work out as hoped. The maker of drugmaker was privatized and delisted in 2013 with a valuation of $490 million and a goal of relisting closer to home with a better stock price and shareholders more familiar with it. “Investors in the United States are looking at Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson — these big pharmaceutical companies” as their first priority in the drug sector, Ren believes.  “China is still too small for them to pay attention to.”  Simcere successfully listed in Hong Kong last year, raising HK$3.57 billion ($460.6 million) in Hong Kong from the sale of 261 million shares at HK$13.70 apiece on Oct.  27. The valuation is a lot better – HK$20.7 billion as of Friday, putting Ren into the ranks of the world’s billionaires with an estimated fortune worth $1.4 billion. It’s also benefitted Shanghai-headquartered Fosun International, which invested in Simcere when it was listed in New York and didn’t sell when it delisted.  Yet newer investors — including funds associated with Hillhouse Capital and OrbiMed — are still waiting for a payback from the relisting:  Simcere’s shares closed at HK$7.90 on Friday, well below their Hong Kong listing price.   Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Chairman Ren Jinsheng Ren, 59, has a long view and sees a lot of progress at Simcere. Once focused on generic drugs, Simcere is making more innovative drugs of its own.  They accounted for more than 57% of sales in the first half of this year, compared with 45% a year earlier.  Simcere has another 60 innovative drugs in the pipeline – being developed alone and with foreign partners, including 11 in a clinical trial phase.   Innovative drugs helped to increase overall sales by 10% in the first half of the year to 2.1 billion yuan, or $325 million, and net profit to 555 million yuan, an earnings gain of 200% from a year earlier. Simcere has set up R&D centers in Shanghai  in 2018 and Boston in 2019, attracting fresh talent; international partnerships this year alone include Vivoryon of Germany and Kazia Therapeutics of Australia. In July, the U.S. FDA gave fast-track designation to a breast cancer treatment developed by North Carolina-headquartered G1 Therapeutics; Simcere is responsible for the development and commercialization of the drug in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Simcere’s upgrading push comes amid growing demand for healthcare treatment in China, an increasingly well-off yet aging country. “China's market demand is becoming bigger, and our understanding of the industry is becoming deeper,” he said. “Our industry has changed a lot in recent years,” the quarter-center veteran of China’s pharmaceuticals industry said.  “Opportunities abound.” Ren’s interest in medicine dates back decades. He received an undergraduate degree in Chinese pharmacology in the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine in 1982; Ren maintains a collection of Chinese medical instruments in a private history museum located in the basement of Simcere’s headquarters. He went to work for a state-owned pharmaceutical company near Shanghai after graduation, and took the plunge as an entrepreneur by starting Simcere in March 1995 with 20,000 yuan, then the equivalent of about $2,500.  Early on, with limited capital, Simcere was a distributor. Ren later began to build more of his own innovative intellectual property in 2006 with the launch of Endostar, the first approved first-line innovative drug in China for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. More innovative drugs have followed, with a focus on treatments for cancer, autoimmune and neurological illness.   There’s wide consensus that China’s pharmaceutical industry has room to grow. Sales are expected to increase an average of 6.8% annually from 2020 to 2024, reaching 2.2 trillion yuan in 2024, according to researchers Frost & Sullivan. The biological pharmaceuticals segment that Simcere operates in is expected to expand the fastest – 17% a year. The industry is benefitting from expanded Chinese reimbursement for cancer drugs and speedier regulatory approvals of new drugs in the country, as well China’s early economic recovery from the pandemic. Ren’s long experience in the business has helped him keep a good ear to the ground for Chinese in regulatory changes, he said. A key to realizing Simcere’s ambitions, Ren emphasized at length, is attracting top research talent. Among the company’s 900 researchers, 52% have overseas study or work experience; keeping those overseas returnees and attracting more, he said, requires the right environment because the innovativeness of his business revolves around the talent he can attract, he said.  Simcere Vice President Vicky Song is among the hundreds of researchers at the company with overseas ... [+] work experience or education. To that end, though his headquarters is in Nanjing, Ren is upbeat about Shanghai. “Almost all multinational companies have their China headquarters basically in Shanghai” in the pharmaceutical industry because of its openness, schools and international flavor, Ren observed. Those active in the eastern China international business hub include Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Roche. To keep competitive in the search for talent, Simcere plans to expand its number of locations in Shanghai from one to three. Density matters with talented people in research, Ren noted; they work more effectively together. One big plus in Shanghai that allows pharmaceutical talent to move quickly to nearby cities such as Nanjing is China’s speedy high-speed rail network.   One Simcere recruit with experience in the world of pharmaceutical multinational world is Vicky Song, who started her career as a physician in Shanghai before switching to the private sector. She joined Simcere last year as vice president overseeing clinical tests, after earlier positions in China at AstraZeneca, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson. One strength at multinationals, she observed, is long experience among key staff. Her mere presence brings that to Simcere.  Amid strains between the U.S. and China, Ren sounded upbeat about prospects between the two countries when it comes to collaboration in the pharmaceutical industry. “In China 20 years ago, more people were riding bicycles, there were fewer cars and fewer tall buildings,” Ren said.  Even though China has come a long way in a short time, China and Simcere still needs to catch up, collaborate and innovate more. That flexible spirit and long-term thinking is in line with the approach that has led Ren to build up Simcere over the past quarter century. “(As) we’re developing the special characteristics of this industry, we must have a medium - and long-term mentality,” he said. And more important than money, according to the billionaire, “is the process of learning and adapting.” See related posts:  U.S.-China Cancer Collaboration Could Open Door For New “Ping-Pong” Diplomacy — Kevin Rudd Bayer Sees A Golden Age For China’s Pharma Industry @rflannerychina",https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/09/12/chinas-simcere-pharmaceutical-advances-at-home-after-exit-from-nyse/,China’s Simcere Pharmaceutical Advances At Home After Exit From NYSE
"Atmosphere outside the Imperial Theatre on June 29, 2020 (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images) Everything’s coming up roses for the Shubert Organization. As the Broadway landlord begins to reopen its 17 Broadway theaters for the first time in 18 months during the COVID-19 pandemic, it will also receive more than $82.3 million from a blockbuster real estate deal. Shubert recently agreed to sell two vacant lots on Eighth Avenue and the air rights above the Imperial Theatre to a real estate developer, Extell Development Company. The sale of the air rights for $51,215,861, eclipses the previous record of $41 million set in 2017 when Shubert sold the air rights above the Cort Theatre. When the company previously turned thin air into millions of dollars, its clever accountants took advantage of a tax rule to postpone paying any capital gains taxes. Known as a “Starker exchange,” if a business takes the money that it receives from selling a piece of real estate and exchanges the money for another piece of real estate, then it will only pay capital gain taxes when it sells the second piece of real estate. “By strategically conducting an exchange, you can scale up, [and] diversify your real estate portfolio by type of property and geography,” explained Jeff Rhode, a commercial real estate investor. The tax trick “provides a wide range of potential benefits,” he stated. Shubert has certainly diversified its real estate portfolio beyond Broadway theaters. In 2017, the Broadway landlord exchanged the $17.1 million it received from the sale of air rights above the Majestic Theatre for a Chase Bank branch and a Bank of America branch in Illinois. It also swapped its proceeds from other air rights deals for some McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in Georgia. While Shubert executives declined to discuss how the money from its big pandemic payday will be used, Extell confirmed that the land and the air rights will be used for a mixed use development. The real estate developer spent over $186 million piecing together 11 parcels of land on the site since 2014, and paperwork filed with the government suggests that the new building between 45th Street and 46th Street will be a 40-story hotel with three observation decks. While Extell plans to break ground on the site within the next year, it promised to halt all construction during performances at the Imperial Theatre next door. The $16.75 million musical Ain’t Too Proud is scheduled to resume performances there on Saturday, October 16. According to Julio Peterson, Shubert’s vice president of real estate, the company considered constructing a new Broadway theatre in the space over a decade ago. But, after the economic downturn in 2007, Shubert abandoned its plans for the site.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/marchershberg/2021/09/12/shubert-organization-floating-on-air-after-record-breaking-deal/,Broadway Theater Owner Floating On Air After Record-Breaking Deal

Thrity-four years after Nieves, now the Miami Marlins pitching coach, threw the first no-hitter in franchise history, the Brewers finally added a second Saturday night when Corbin Burnes and Josh Hader teamed up to accomplish the feat against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field in Cleveland. With that scarcity snapped, the Brewers now turn their attentions to another: the 39 years marking their last World Series appearance. And that, more than anything, is why Brewers manager Craig Counsell made the unpopular but necessary decision to pull Burnes with his chance for history hanging in the balance.  The right-hander had already thrown 115 pitches — seven more than the career-high of 108 he threw over 8 1/3 innings on July 18 — and while he showed no signs of fatigue or slowing down, Counsell turned to closer Josh Hader anyway for the final three outs.  ""We just had to put a bigger picture in our head a little bit about what’s going on here,"" Counsell said. ""A different season, something different happens there, but we have to understand what’s going to happen for the next six weeks here and keep that in mind.” To navigate those six weeks, which cover the rest of the regular season and three rounds of the playoffs, the Brewers absolutely need Burnes to be at his best. And while he very well may have gone back out, retired the last three Cleveland batters quickly and basked in all the glory that comes with a no-hitter, there's also a chance that something bad could have happened. All it takes is one pitch to derail a season or even a career, and the risk becomes greater with each pitch thrown.  Considering what's at stake; namely, the possibility of the Brewers' first-ever World Series championship, the choice was easy. ""From my perspective, he’s got a lot of innings ahead of him still this year, a lot of really important innings ahead of him this year,"" Counsell said. ""I want to make sure he’s in the best possible position for those innings. He wanted to go out there, for sure, but I think he also understood.” Counsell's decision drew its fair share of scorn from the self-proclaimed experts of baseball Twitter but there was something appropriate about a combined no-hitter for a team that has spent a small fortune on WD-40 to keep a revolving clubhouse door well-lubricated this season. Thanks to a rash of injuries, positive COVID-19 tests, subpar performances from key players and a desire to keep the bullpen as fresh as possible the Brewers have utilized an all-hands-on-deck approach since the start of the season, going through 60 different players in the process. That team approach, in which the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, has enabled Milwaukee to not only survive a cavalcade of setbacks but excel in spite of them and beyond the obvious talent, is the biggest reason the Brewers find themselves on the verge of locking down a postseason spot.  So while unpopular, handing the ball to Hader was fitting because this game, this accomplishment was a complete and total team effort. There was Cain's diving grab to end the eighth, which conjured images of Robin Yount's leaping catch to seal Milwaukee's only other no-hitter; Jace Peterson chasing Austin Hedges' pop-up all the way to the railing in foul territory for the second out of the ninth and catcher Omar Narvaez's efforts to call the right pitches at the right moments according to the game plan compiled by Milwaukee's coaching staff. Then there’s Hader, who has been just as dominant as Burnes and just as vital to the team’s success this season.  ""A Burnes-and-Hader no-hitter for the Brewers is two names that deserve to be in a no-hitter; they do,"" Counsell said. ""For what they’ve done for this organization, I think Josh’s name associated with it is appropriate.” Add in the remaining defensive plays and the early output from an offensive group that was stymied once Zach Plesac settled in and Burnes had no issue sharing the spotlight, especially with the understanding that the best might be yet to come. ""We've done a lot of impressive things as a team as a whole,"" Burnes said. "" It's an exciting time in the organization for sure. We're fired up. We're excited to play every day and we don't feel like there's any game we can't win.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2021/09/12/combined-no-hit-bid-a-fitting-reward-for-the-milwaukee-brewers-team-first-approach-this-season/,Combined No-Hit Bid A Fitting Accomplishment For The Milwaukee Brewers’ Team-First Approach This Season

(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for The Recording Academy) Just two days ago, BTS landed one of the greatest honors possible on YouTube, as another one of their music videos passed one billion views. Now, less than half a week later, the South Korean septet has repeated that feat yet again. This time, BTS’s music video that accompanied their single “Idol” has reached one billion plays on YouTube, making it the rare success among visuals uploaded by South Korean musicians. The visual treatment was posted to YouTube in August 2018, so it took a little more than three years for the clip to reach one billion plays.  BTS have now seen half a dozen of their official music videos reach one billion views on YouTube, with some moving past that benchmark and adding many millions to their totals. Earlier this week, their “Fake Love” clip joined the billion-view club, becoming their fifth title to do so. Previously, the seven-member vocal band’s videos for singles “Boy With Luv” with Halsey, “DNA,” “Dynamite” and “Mic Drop” with Steve Aoki all managed the same. “Idol” nearly became BTS’s second top 10 hit on the Hot 100 in America when it was released in 2018, but it missed the highest tier on the tally by one space. The track was aided in its ascent up the chart by the inclusion of Nicki Minaj, who lent both her talents and her famous name to the cut. The single was featured on BTS’s compilation Love Yourself: Answer, which went right to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, bringing the band back to the summit for the second time.  BTS’s BANGTANTV channel remains the third-most subscribed-to page on YouTube, as the vocal band has now accrued a whopping 57.5 million followers. The septet comes in behind only Blackpink (65.5 million) and Justin Bieber (65.1 million), with those two acts swapping positions on the all-time ranking just yesterday (September 10). Between all the various forms of content they post on the “personal” account, the BANGTANTV channel has now racked up more than 12.5 billion views.

"Cory Aldridge (l.) was the youngest player on the field during the September 21, 2001 game between ... [+] the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets when baseball returned after the September 11th attacks. AFP PHOTO/Matt CAMPBELL via Getty Images) Cory Aldridge joined the Atlanta Braves in 2001 as a September call-up in the middle of a tight pennant race. After an injury-plagued minor league season, the Braves hoped the experience would groom the rookie outfielder for a spot in next year’s lineup; however, just a few days into Aldridge’s major league career, the September 11th terrorist attacks suddenly brought any momentum he had to a screeching halt.  “I was very excited I got the call up,” Aldridge said during a recent phone interview. “I was hoping I'd get to see the field a little more when I first got there, but because of September 11th, I really sat there for almost two weeks without even doing anything. It wasn't the glory that I wanted, but we're also in the playoff race.” Aldridge was in his downtown Atlanta hotel the morning of September 11, 2001, when he received a phone call from a friend to turn on the television. Minutes later his mother called telling him to do the same. After seeing the same image on multiple stations, Aldridge knew something was very wrong. “That’s when I kind of put things together,” he said. “I'm pretty sure I tried to call my agent, and nothing was going through. Shortly after that I got a call from the Braves basically saying, ‘Hey, you’ve gotta get out of your hotel.’ Right next to my hotel was the CDC building, and [the Braves] were like, ‘Hey, you know all these federal buildings are being targeted.’” Still fresh to the team in an era when cell phones and social media weren’t prevalent, the 22-year-old Aldridge quickly found himself isolated in a major city under the threat of a terrorist attack. Luckily, he had a friend nearby to stay with in the interim, but otherwise he felt like he was out of the loop.  “Nobody really knew what to do,” he said. “It wasn't like social media and things like that, so everything was word of mouth and phone calls; there wasn’t any texting going on. You were getting calls from certain people telling you this is what's gonna happen. I just remember [the Braves] basically just saying, ‘Hold tight, we'll see what happens.’ Every other day on the news, there’s another threat here, another threat at the CDC, and I'm downtown trying to figure out if this building is going to get bombed. I was kind of in a scare of what was going to happen next.” The 9/11 attacks and ensuing days of isolation revealed how low Aldridge and his fellow rookie call-ups were in the team’s pecking order. With everyone focused on their safety and the uncertainty of when baseball would return, Aldridge said he was almost an afterthought to the organization.  “When all that happened, there were so many other things more important than worrying about what the rookies were doing,” he said. “That’s what kind of sucked for a couple of other guys and me. It was like, ‘Okay, you guys are here, but there's so many things right now that are superseding you guys at this moment.’ … It was like, we're not really worried about you guys right now, because number one, we're in a playoff race, 9/11 just happened, there’s security, and all these other things are way more important than making sure [we were taken care of].” When the Braves resumed practice a few days later, it gave Aldridge and his teammates a distraction from what was going on. There was still uncertainty that MLB would resume its season; however, that cleared up when MLB notified the Braves they would be playing the Mets on September 21, 2001, at Shea Stadium. The following trip to New York was a wake-up call for the rookie from Abilene, Texas.  “I think we flew to Philadelphia and drove to New York,” he said. “I just remember coming over the hill to New York; you could see the whole city and there's really nobody outside. It was the weirdest thing ever. … My first real major league trip, and I expected to see what I’ve seen on every movie in my lifetime in New York, but nothing happened. There was really nobody outside; it was crazy, a ghost town.”  Watching the recent MLB Network documentary, Remembering the Game for New York, Aldridge relived the highly structured routine leading up to the September 21st game. He recalled entering the field with an ambiguity that clouded not only the game, but his safety as well. “The morning of the game, I remember it was just weird,” he said. “Everything was just protocol. We had to be here at this time, versus everybody doing their own thing getting cabs and things like that. It was all protocol, security protocol, media, you’ve gotta be here and do this, but when we got to the field it was a surreal moment. “We didn't feel like we're supposed to win. It just wasn't the same. It was like we’re playing this game and putting a band aid on a huge wound, but it wasn't the same as going out there saying I want to compete against these guys. It was more or less saying, ‘Hey, we're not scared.’ I remember going to the stadium and being like, ‘Man, s—t, somebody could [do something].’ We were looking for planes in the sky, crazy stuff like that. It was 50,000 people there, but I just remember there were all kinds of guards, yet it didn’t really feel that safe.” After an emotional opening ceremony and tribute, both teams took the field. For the next few hours, fans were caught up in the action of a 1-1 game, engaged in something other than the endless news cycle documenting the terror attacks. In the top of the eighth inning, Braves first baseman Julio Franco drew a two-out walk. Manager Bobby Cox summoned Aldridge to pinch run for the 42-year-old ageless wonder. He suddenly remembered the scouting report his teammates gave about the Mets’ pickoff play.  “They were always telling me they had a great pick off move at first,” he said. “Todd Zelie was playing first, and they were like, stay in his back pocket. Wherever he goes, you’ve gotta touch it. If you ever watch that game, you’ll see me with my hand on his back. Everywhere he moves, I’m moving. He’s getting pissed, ‘Why don’t you stop touching my butt?’” Playing in just his third major league game, Aldridge was battling his nerves while representing the go-ahead run with two outs. After moving to second base on a Chipper Jones single, Brian Jordan stepped to the plate with a chance to bring Aldridge in to gain the edge. “I was so nervous,"" he said. ""This is a huge game, my first real on the base action, like what is going on here? Chipper [Jones] got a hit, I remember it being two outs and I’m on second base. I was like man, I don’t care where this ball goes, I’m scoring. Back then I was fast. I remember feeling like I was the fastest person in the world coming around third base. I was going to score regardless, but I felt at that time, I was not getting out. ... When Brian hit that ball, everything felt natural to me.”  Coming back to a dugout of high fives, Aldridge did his job, putting the Braves up 2-1 going into the bottom of the eighth. Out of the game, all he could do was hope his friend Steve Karsay could hold the lead. Even with the Queens native on the mound, he knew when Mike Piazza stepped to the plate with a runner on base, it was the perfect fit for a storybook ending.  “It was almost like when Piazza came up, it felt like everything was set up,” he said. “Before that, I remember the two non-called strikes. Those were good pitches. The guy probably should have been out, but I just feel like it was just set up for that to happen. The stars just lined up for the best player on their team, their star, to win that game.” NEW YORK, UNITED STATES: The New York Mets and Atlanta Braves exchange greetings before the game ...

I can’t explain the energy of it, but it was like, we’re back. The Twin Towers may be gone, but we’re back!”  The game signaled much more than baseball's return; it was permission to start moving forward with life. Aldridge found it evident the next morning when meeting Jordan and Bernard Gilkey for breakfast. Stepping out of the hotel, he saw a pulse that was absent just days earlier when the team arrived.  “I remember going outside the next morning and people were outside,” he said. “Everything wasn’t necessarily back to normal, but people were outside. I remember that same night, I was in the hotel bar hanging out trying to see the city. It looked somewhat like what I had seen on TV. … That game opened up everybody to say, ‘Okay, it's time to kind of get back to life.’” Reflecting on the game twenty years later, Aldridge said the entire ordeal exposed how little he knew about the world outside of playing baseball.   “It made me understand how ignorant I was to the real world,” he said. “Now I’ve read a lot, I’ve experienced a lot and traveled a lot. I’ve been to multiple countries and played in multiple countries. I understand baseball, business, and life a lot differently. At that time, I didn’t really take baseball as serious as I should because I didn’t know any better. I was super young, from a small city and just didn’t have a lot of information.” He can draw on those life experiences to put the game in its proper perspective, something he couldn’t do in the heavy moment of that situation.  “I look back at all the things I’ve been able to experience, now I can reflect on a lot of stuff totally differently than when I experienced it. I think of all the things when I was in New York and the things I saw. It’s an era of baseball that’s totally different now, but that’s something that will always be historic, to be there to witness and be a part of that game. That’s probably one of the most important games ever played. ... I was seeing a lot of stuff, a lot of celebrities, important people that now I understand who they are. There were so many people we saw at that time that I can now understand possibly why they were there, or just the magnitude of them even being there. … Throughout my lifetime as far as baseball, I’ve been a part of some amazing things. As bad as September 11th was, I was definitely super fortunate to even be a part of that situation.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickdiunte/2021/09/11/cory-aldridges-reflections-as-the-youngest-player-in-the-mets-braves-first-game-after-9-11/,Cory Aldridge’s Reflections As The Youngest Player In The Mets-Braves Game After 9/11

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) When 18-year-old Emma Raducanu first came to New York about three weeks ago, she booked her flights home to Great Britain for after the U.S. Open qualifying tournament. But she kept on winning and winning and winning, and never did fly home. “I didn't expect to be here at all,” she said. “I mean, I think my flights were booked at the end of qualifying, so it's a nice problem to have.” Raducanu, ranked No. 150 in the world, completed arguably the most improbable and captivating run ever in a Grand Slam tournament when she beat 19-year-old Leylah Annie Fernandez, 6-4, 6-3, to win the U.S. Open Saturday in a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium on the 20th anniversary of 9/11. In something out of a fairytale, Raducanu won 10 straight matches in New York — including three in qualifying — without dropping a set. It was the first all-teenage women’s final since Serena Williams beat Martina Hingis in 1999. “Most of all I will say thank you to everyone here in New York,” she said on court. “Thank you for making me feel so at home from my first qualifyijng match all the though too the final. You really inspired me and I hope that me and Leylah put on a good performance today.” Raducanu, who was born in Toronto to a Romanian father and Chinese mother, will take home $2.5 million for winning the title, while Fernandez earned $1.25 million.

Fernandez may have been more worn down coming into the final after winning four straight three-set matches, while Raducanu lost a total of 27 games entering the final. Fernandez left the court briefly after the set and then earned a quick break for 2-1 in the second. But Raducanu quickly got the break back with a backhand return winner on break point to make it 2-all.  After holding, she seized a 4-2 lead with a forehand passing shot, and then clenched her fist as the crowd erupted.

Serving a 5-3, 30-30, Raducanu drew blood from her left knee after scraping it on the court during a long rally and after losing the point, took a medical timeout to get a bandage. But it didn’t hamper her play and she arrived at her third match point. She served an ace and then collapsed to the court on her back before hugging Fernandez on her side. “Leylah’s always going to play great tennis and always going to fight, that’s just the competitor she is and that’s why she’s here in the finals,” Raducanu said. “I was just praying not for a double fault [after the medical timeout] but we got through it. I think just staying in the moment and focusing. My process and mindset really helped in the tough match.” Raducanu is only 18 and has a wide-open road ahead, but it will be interesting to see how her career unfolds from here. A number of recent Grand Slam champions were one-and-done and haven’t been able to win a second one, including Jelena Ostapenko, Sloane Stephens, Sofia Kenin, Iga Swiatek and Sofia Kenin. “I think it shows that the future of women’s tennis and the depth of the women’s game is so great,” Raducanu said. “Every single player in the women’s draw has a shot to win the tournament. Let’s hope the next generation can follow in the footsteps of some of the legends, like Billie Jean King.” The future is bright for Fernandez, too, after she proved she has no fear on the biggest of stages and can take down established players. She also continued to have the support of a raucous Canadian contingent including Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash, a fellow Canadian who sat in her player box yet again. “Emma played amazing so congratulation to Emma and your team,” Fernandez said. “I’m very proud of the way I played these last two weeks and the New York crowd is amazing. Having you cheer me on, thank you so much, New York.” She added: “I hope to be back here in the finals and this time with the trophy...with the right trophy.” She then asked for the microphone back and concluded with: “I know on this day it was especially hard for New York and everyone around the United States. I just want to say that I hope I can be as strong and as resilient as New York has been the past 20 years. Thank you for having my back and I hope to see you next year.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/11/18-year-old-emma-raducanu-goes-from-qualifier-to-us-open-champion-after-winning-10th-straight-match/,18-Year-Old Emma Raducanu Goes From Qualifier To U.S. Open Champion After Winning 10th Straight Match
"MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN - MARCH 22: Edmond Sumner #5 of the Indiana Pacers dribbles the ball in the ... [+] second quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks at the Fiserv Forum on March 22, 2021 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images) Indiana Pacers guard Edmond Sumner tore his left Achilles earlier this week, the team announced. He suffered the injury in an offseason workout on September 9th, just a few weeks prior to the official start of training camp. The Pacers have plans to have several players get together and work out prior to camp, however, meaning some team activities were set to begin soon. Sumner will now not be a part of those pre-camp ventures. A torn Achilles is a brutal injury, one that typically sidelines a player for nearly a full year, so it is possible that the 25-year old will miss the entirety of the 2021-22 season for Indiana. “My boy was bound for a HUGE year,” Sumner’s former teammate, Brian Bowen II, tweeted. “Big prayers for a healthy and speedy recovery,” he added. Bowen may have been right. While Sumner’s spot in the healthy-Pacers rotation wasn’t clear, every season of his career so far he found a way to earn minutes and have an impact on winning. Entering a contract year, it was reasonable to assume that the Xavier product would impress again and earn playing time. He has improved in each season since entering the league. Now, his journey will be put on hold. Instead of being able to show off his skills and establish himself in front of a new Pacers coaching staff, Sumner will have to spend significant time rehabbing, which will be a setback in his promising career. Fortunately for the speedy guard, improving medical practices have made Achilles tears less damning for NBA players in recent seasons. Kevin Durant, John Wall, and Rudy Gay have all recovered from the injury in the last four seasons and have been able to make an impact upon returning. While the injury requires a lengthy rehab process, players have been able to get back on the floor and help their teams. Outside of Durant and Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins, though, most players who return from an Achilles tear are less effective upon doing so. Many of them have remained skilled and useful players, just not at the same level that they were pre-injury. Sumner will hope that he is one of the rare players who can continue to grow even after his injury. “You always want to build on things. For me it’s a confidence booster,” Sumner said last season. This is another blow for the Pacers as it comes on the heels of the T.J. Warren injury update from earlier this week. Sumner has been a key reserve for the past two seasons, and his ability to run in transition as well as his defensive abilities have made him useful within a variety of lineups. His skills are unique and difficult to replace. Even though the addition of first round pick Chris Duarte was going to reduce Sumner’s role this year, the Pacers now don’t have as much insurance and depth behind their rookie, which is a volatile position to be in. While Duarte could impress this season, rookies typically aren’t impactful and are inconsistent. Having less depth behind Duarte will hurt Indiana. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) is defended by Indiana Pacers guard Edmond Sumner ... [+] during an NBA basketball game in San Francisco, Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Nine-year veteran Jeremy Lamb can fill in as a reserve shooting guard, and he will likely receive more minutes this season with Sumner and Warren on the mend. However, J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star reported that the Pacers have been trying to deal Lamb, so he may not be around for long. That adds to the list of reasons this Sumner injury stings — the reserve shooting guard situation in Indiana is tenuous.  The blue and gold finished free agency and looked like a team full of depth and useful players. Now, after Warren and Sumner have new injury diagnoses, the appearance of the roster has changed — the Pacers are already looking at a more defined rotation early in the season and less wiggle room for injuries and change. Not many on the Pacers can replicate Sumner’s skillset. As John Schuhmann of NBA.com pointed out, the quick guard was one of just three players who averaged more than four points per 36 minutes during fast breaks this past season — Sumner is electric in transition. In set play situations, the Xavier product has become a reliable outside shooter; he canned nearly 40% of his three-point shots in 2020-21. And Sumner is a better defensive player than offensive. He was tasked with containing Stephen Curry this past season and helped hold the former MVP to just 20 points, his ninth worst scoring output of the season. Sumner’s wingspan and lateral mobility make him a pest on defense, and the Pacers now won’t have those skills for an extended period of time. “You can ask him to guard about anybody,” former Indiana head coach Nate Bjorkgren said of Sumner. “He’s a defensive guy for us, an energy guy for us.” While the 25-year old struggles in other areas, such as team defense and shot creation for his teammates — enough that he wasn’t guaranteed a role this coming season — losing him is still a blow for the blue and gold. They now will have to rely more on Lamb and Duarte, one player that struggled this past season and another that hasn’t played a single minute in the NBA. The Pacers range of results this coming season is wider as a result of Sumner’s injury. “This isn’t it for me,” Sumner wrote, in a longer caption, on Instagram. Sumner has battled through numerous injuries throughout this playing days — to his knees, his hand, and his hamstrings. He has overcome all of them and continued to improve. Now, he has to fight through an Achilles tear, the most difficult challenge he has faced so far in his basketball career. If his history tells us anything, it’s that Sumner will come back from this injury and play again. But in the meantime, the Pacers will suffer and be forced to rely on others. Indiana’s depth will be tested early in the 2021-22 campaign.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyeast/2021/09/11/edmond-sumner-tears-left-achilles-as-indiana-pacers-depth-shrinks/,Edmond Sumner Tears Left Achilles As Indiana Pacers’ Depth Shrinks
"The documentary LuLaRich tells the story of the rise and fall of the multi-level marketer LuLaRoe, ... [+] which is run by founder DeAnne Stidham and her husband/chief executive officer Mark Stidham. Documenting the rise and fall of the multi-level marketing (MLM) firm LuLaRoe wasn’t easy for documentary filmmakers Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason because the story is bizarre.  Still, their Amazon Prime film LuLaRich, which dropped Friday, rises to the occasion. It also may lay the groundwork for a scripted movie or TV series, according to Furst. “We're gonna be ready to do some press on that shortly,” said Furst in an interview, who declined to elaborate. LuLaRoe was founded in 2012 by DeAnne Stidham, whom LuLaRoe said was a single mother of 7 children. The company was named after her three oldest grandchildren Lucy, Lola, and Munroe. Stidham’s second husband, Mark, is LuLaRoe’s chief executive officer.  Many members of their combined families work for the company.  An exception is her twin sister Dianne Ingram who reportedly became estranged from DeAnne over a dispute over the company that became LuLaRoe. Dianne operated her own MLM called Honey & Lace, which sold leggings and other fashions.  The company changed its name to Piphany in 2019.   LuLaRoe accused Piphany and several former LuLaRoe representatives of poaching LuLaRoe sales and filed suit. LuLaRoe said in February 2019 that the two companies had settled their dispute through mediation.  Epiphany now operates as Savvi.  It isn’t clear what, if any, role Ingram has in the company. “We find ourselves making these documentary events that are stranger than fiction,” said Furst, who, along with Willoughby Mason, made Fyre Fraud, about the notorious music festival, in an interview. “And sometimes you can't make this stuff up. It's real, but it's, it's bizarre.” As LuLaRich points out, the company took the Internet by storm with colorful leggings that fans described as “buttery soft.”  Its message of empowerment attracted millennial women, mainly stay-at-home moms, with promises of earning full-time wages working part-time hours. By 2016, LuLaRoe was generating revenue of $1 billion through its network of 35,000 independent sales representatives. LuLaRoe had 100,000 fashion consultants generating annual sales of $2.32 billion in 2017. MLMs like LuLaRoe, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Pampered Chef, and Amway rely on networks of independent sales representatives who make money by selling products and attracting new members to their networks.  Critics have long complained that most MLM participants don’t make much money. As I noted for CBS MoneyWatch in 2017, LuLaRoe’s representatives earned an average yearly commission of $85. Joining LuLaRoe wasn’t cheap. The company required new members to buy “onboarding packages” containing an assortment of its fashions costing $4,925 to $9,000. It also recommended that salespeople keep about $20,000 in inventory and encouraged its representatives — who weren’t employees — to invest in their businesses continually.  As the movie points out, LuLaRoe recommended that cash-strapped consultants sell their breast milk and max out their credit cards to make ends meet.  Unfortunately, the quality of LuLaRoe’s leggings plummeted and sales became harder to get as the ranks of sales representatives mushroomed. Many consultants went broke and sold the merchandise at steep discounts. Some went bankrupt. “They feel like they got gaslight,” Nason said in an interview. “I think that anybody could potentially fall, for a get-rich-quick scenario, whether it is just to have a friend to talk to that sells clothes and you become a seller because of it because you want to make money.” LuLaRich shows how LuLaRoe fostered a cult-like atmosphere by encouraging overweight sales representatives to get gastric bypass surgery in Mexico.  The Stidhams ostracized sales consultants who spoke out about their mistreatment.  Meanwhile, LuLaRoe’s legal woes multiplied.  MyDyer, the company’s leading supplier, sued LuLaRoe in 2018 over $49 million in unpaid invoices. The suit alleges that the Stidhams hid money and assets through shell companies and that Mark Stidham threatened to flee with his wife to the Bahamas.  According to media reports, the Stidhams deny MyDyer’s allegations and have filed a $1 billion countersuit against the company. Earlier this year, LuLaRoe settled a lawsuit with Washington State accusing it of running a pyramid scheme for $4.75 million.  The company also faces lawsuits from customers over selling defective merchandise and collecting sales tax in states that didn’t levy it on clothing sales. “We're interested to see what happens because the ball is no longer in our court,” Furst said, adding that he wasn’t aware of any criminal investigations into LuLaRoe. “ We've put the ball in the viewer’s court. Attorneys generals in the country can follow suit. They have a whole roadmap presented by the state of Washington.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanberr/2021/09/11/lularoe-saga-may-become-scripted-movie-or-tv-show/,Producers Of LuLaRoe Documentary Have A Scripted Show In The Works
"Sam Francisco 49ers prepare for Week 1 against Detroit Lions. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The San Francisco 49ers currently find themselves as eight-point favorites on the road against the Detroit Lions in their season opener. Outside of the defending champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers “Thursday Night Football” matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, it’s the largest spread on the NFL Week 1 slate.  In no way does this mean that Kyle Shanahan and Co. can overlook a hapless Detroit team on the road. This will be the regular-season coaching debut of Dan Campbell for the Lions. He’s attempting to change the culture for that long-downtrodden organization.  Despite their status as heavy favorites, there’s several things the 49ers must do Sunday afternoon in order to come away with a season-opening win. Below, I look at the five biggest keys to the game for the San Francisco 49ers.  San Francisco 49ers must jump on the Detroit Lions early and often Week 1. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) Whether it was Jimmy Garoppolo or Trey Lance under center, San Francisco’s offense looked darn good during the preseason. Garoppolo will get the start Week 1 with Lance likely seeing action in certain packages. Either way, the 49ers must take advantage of a weak Lions defense early and often.  Detroit yielded a league-worst 32.4 points per game a season ago. Outside of adding a new coordinator in Aaron Glenn, this unit did not improve a whole heck of a lot. San Francisco has plus-level matchups with George Kittle slated to go up against linebacker Jamie Collins and safety Tracy Walker. Meanwhile, sophomore wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk will go up against a young corner in Jeff Okudah who struggled last season (129th out of 137th among NFL corners as a rookie, per Pro Football Focus metrics).  Detroit might have yielded the fifth-most rushing yards a season ago, but it’s time San Francisco gets its passing game going early and often. Step on Detroit’s throats and go from there.  Nick Bosa and the San Francisco 49ers defense have a plus-level matchup against the Detroit Lions ... [+] Week 1. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) One of the most-glaring mismatches of Week 1 has to be star defensive end Nick Bosa going up against Lions rookie offensive tackle Penei Sewell, the latter of whom struggled during the preseason. A left tackle during his days at Oregon, Sewell trained at right tackle during offseason activities and training camp. Unfortunately for the Lions, he’s going to have to protect Jared Goff’s blindside in his regular-season debut with Taylor Decker sidelined.  With starting corner Emmanuel Moseley unlikely to go Sunday, the onus is going to be on San Francisco’s defensive front to put consistent pressure on Goff. That is to say, masking the issues we’re going to see opposite Jason Verrett come Sunday afternoon.  Detroit Lions' Jared Goff will want to make a statement against his former division rivals. (AP ... [+] Photo/Al Goldis) We saw it Thursday night between the defending champion Buccaneers and the Cowboys. Tom Brady and his team entered the game as near double-digit favorites, only to need a game-winning drive in the final seconds to come out on top in front of their home crowd.  Sure the Lions are not as talented as Dallas. It would be foolish to suggest that’s the case. Even then, these are dangerous trap games for teams in San Francisco’s position. Though, it does not look like the 49ers are overlooking this game against a former division rival in that of Jared Goff.  “""I know Jared (Goff) pretty well. I'm sure he wants to prove himself, just as much as all of us,"" All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner told reporters during the week. ""I'm really looking forward to that challenge and going up against him again."" During his time with the Los Angeles Rams, Goff posted a 3-5 record in eight starts against the 49ers. He did, however, throw 14 touchdowns against six interceptions in those eight starts. Goff will want to make a statement in his Lions debut. It’s up to San Francisco to make sure that doesn’t happen.  San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle (85) before an NFL preseason football game against the ... [+] Las Vegas Raiders in Santa Clara, Calif., Sunday, Aug. 29, 2021. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) San Francisco finished last season with the most money tied up on injured reserve in the history of the NFL. It was a prime example of Kyle Shanahan and Co. dealing with an injury bug that pretty much derailed the 49ers season one year after earning a surprise appearance in the Super Bowl.  All things equal, the 49ers are going to be really good this season. They have legitimate Super Bowl aspirations. Outside of the quarterback situation, it’s all going to come down to health. Simply put, a repeat of last season with the likes of Jimmy Garoppolo Nick Bosa, George Kittle and other star players missing extensive action could derail the 49ers in 2021. They need to come out of Week 1 unscathed. INGLEWOOD, CA - AUGUST 22: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (10) and quarterback Trey ... [+] Lance (5) look on before the NFL preseason game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Chargers on August 22, 2021, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA. (Photo by Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Lance was not listed on the 49ers’ final injury report Friday, meaning that he will be good to go against the Lions. Whether we see a lot of the rookie No. 3 pick remains to be seen.  What we do know is that San Francisco used its preseason finale against the Las Vegas Raiders to work both Lance and Garoppolo in the mix. It was an odd-looking two-quarterback system, one that worked throughout the first half of said game.  The entire summer and preseason in Santa Clara was defined by a non-existent quarterback competition between the two. What we see Sunday against Detroit will be telling moving forward. Shanahan can’t simply put Lance in the game so he gets some action. The innovative offensive mind must pick and choose the opportunities. More than anything outside of injuries, how this situation looks could help dictate how the 49ers’ 2021 season will go.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2021/09/11/5-keys-for-the-san-francisco-49ers-week-1-against-the-detroit-lions/,5 Keys For The San Francisco 49ers In Week 1 Against The Detroit Lions

"ST LOUIS, MO - OCTOBER 27: Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images At one point in my career, I went from working for P&G in the U.S. to Eastern Europe. The shift in mindset was significant. Because the U.S. business was so big, we had more risk aversion. We worried about share loss and were extremely careful and measured with moves. Mentally, this was a defensive posture. When I arrived in the Czech Republic after the fall of the wall, it was the complete opposite. It was a mad rush for distribution and share, with major global companies jockeying to win. A competitor would do something on Friday and we were working on the weekend to address it. The objective was growth and the risk in such a market was in not moving fast.  Many big companies have much to lose and so they slip into a defensive mode to minimize risk. Of course, this mindsight can stifle growth. That’s why I was fascinated to talk with Marcel Marcondes, CMO of Anheuser-Busch who has helped steer a tremendous growth spurt for the firm. It was announced this week that there is a transition as Benoit Garbe will become the new CMO. Below is Marcondes’ insight on how he, working with the Chief Sales Officer and the CEO, shifted the firm’s mindset from defense to growth over the past nearly five years. Kimberly A. Whitler: Why did you decide to shift the company’s focus? Marcel Marcondes: Over four years ago, when Michel Doukeris got here as North American CEO, he defined a clear North Star. Although we were the largest brewery in the world and the U.S. we needed to start leading growth creation again. His vision,which became all of ours, was to be both the largest and fastest growing brewery. For short, this vision was translated into LFG – lead future growth. The mission was to not play defensive to protect our size but to embrace significant growth. It is one thing is to defend your position – quite another to drive growth. We should be the fastest growing company. This became our North Star. This was a big change.  Whitler: How did you make the change?  Marcondes: At that point, the CEO, head of sales, and myself worked together to put together a new commercial strategy. We had been working to protect ourselves – and this made us more company centric instead of consumer centric, and we needed to change our approach We needed to become a people-centric company for real. We did this by focusing on three pillars: 1) portfolio rebalance (we used to be the Bud and Bud Light company that is in a segment in decline – we needed to shift to the growing segments), 2) reinvent our innovation machine (the fuel for the portfolio rebalance had to be new innovation), and 3) how our brands connect with consumers (media, sponsorship, with digital capabilities). Whitler: Can you elaborate on the mindset shift this required? Marcondes: I believe that marketers often believe that their job is to change the minds of consumers. Instead, we as marketers need to adjust what we do to meet the needs of consumers. This is not about convincing consumers to buy something. This is about creating what consumers want to buy. This subtle mindset shift required listening intently to consumers. Learning more about them as humans and not statistics. The more we listened, the easier it was to adapt the company to create valuable innovations and relevant communications. Whitler: What were some of the factors that enabled you to achieve the shift? Marcondes: 1)    Have to have the right people who believe in the vision. There was a big reorganization. 2)    We invested in tech to connect with consumers. We built online panels. We now can talk to thousands of consumers on a daily basis. No more focus groups that take weeks to set up. We are like CNN with a newsroom and constant engagement with consumers. 3)    We are a house of brands. We had to shift investments from core to premium brands. We moved beyond beer (e.g., cutwater and canned wine). We really focused on going “beyond beer” and “premiumization”. 4)    Next, it’s about innovation. It used to take two years to introduce a new product. Now it is 100 days. We have a pilot team called the Apollo team. This team develops the pilot and tests it. We have a second team that then takes recommended new products to market. We launched our first premium organic beer. Launched seltzer brands. We just launched a vodka brand.  5)    We created an in-house digital agency called draftLine with more than 150 people. They connect data with creativity. This is about personalization at scale.  6)    Introduced different KPIs. We moved from SOV (share of voice) to share of social media mentions. We are now the #1 in brewer in share of social media mentions. There is an economy of attention – it is hard to grab attention. We focused on moving from visibility to relevance. Our creative work received two awards my first year and now has received 111 awards this year alone. This required a big shift in risk taking. We have newsroom meetings weekly – track everything that is trending and try to ensure that when something is relevant and “on brand,” we are engaged. Whitler: What are the results of this plan?

"Alexia Landeau, Elisabeth Shue, Sarah Jones and Julie Delpy in the series 'On The Verge' On The Verge is a new series created by Julie Delpy, on Netflix since September 7. Produced by Michael Gentile and Lauraine Heftler at The Film TV for Canal Plus and Netflix, this 12-episode series is a smart and funny portrait of four women. Set two months before the pandemic outbreak, On The Verge follows four friends living in Los Angeles, all middle-aged women, Justine, Anne, Ell and Yasmin (played by Julie Delpy, Elisabeth Shue, Alexia Landeau and Sarah Jones). The series dives into their lives, and how their friendships help them grapple with their marital conflicts, raising their children, and their professional careers. Full of unapologetic wit and humor, On the Verge is a lighthearted comedy with great performances. With its 30-minute-long episodes, the series is an easy-to-binge comedy, that works more like an elongated movie than a series—the fact that the opening images echo the last episode suggests that too. There are no big twists, no major conflict, no cliffhangers punctuating each episode to entice viewers to watch the next. Instead, the series focuses on the portrayal of these four characters and their relationship, making it largely dependent on whether these characters are relatable and intriguing enough for viewers to continue to the next episode. In my opinion, they are. Offering a different view of middle-aged women than what shows like Desperate Housewives presented, On the Verge chronicles these four women’s lives and the awkward, and at times absurd, situations they find themselves in. It feels similar to Girls, Sex And the City or the Spanish series Valeria in the way that it portrays a tight-knit group of women friends. Justine (played by Delpy herself) is a French chef with her own restaurant Chez Juste, who has been commissioned by her recovering-sex addict of a boss (Giovanni Ribisi) to write a recipe book while raising her son. She is married to a disparaging husband, Martin (Mathieu Demy), an architect, who is having difficulty finding a job in L.A. since relocating there from France. Elisabeth Shue plays Anne, a clothing designer, who likes to smoke a little marijuana. Living in her Venice house, bought by her mother, Anne appears to have the perfect life, with her German au pair who never seems to be doing anything, but Anne is about to separate from her husband. Ell (Alexia Landeau) is a single mother of three children, all from different men, who is struggling to hold down a job, finding goofy schemes instead to make money. And Yasmin (Sarah Jones) is a stay-at-home mother, trying to restart her career in politics. A feminist with a son she named Orion, she is prone to panic attacks.  These four women have no secrets from each other, knowing every intimate detail of their lives, details which as the dinner party in episode 2 shows the husbands have never heard of, and by the look on their faces, in fact, did not need to know about. Delpy is great at creating these little moments of awkwardness. Films or series about middle-aged women are rare. This is in a way what makes On the Verge feel refreshing. If you liked Julie Delpy’s films, such as 2 Days in Paris and 2 Days in New York and their goofy tone, you’re sure to enjoy On the Verge—the latter and the series were in fact both co-written by Delpy and Alexia Landeau (who played her sister in the films). Much like 2 Days in New York, On the Verge is a smartly written and directed lighthearted comedy, with Delpy directing five episodes, Mathieu Demy (who also directed episodes of The Bureau) directing four, and David Petrarca the remainder.  The series was filmed in Los Angeles between the first and second waves of the pandemic (after a three-month delay the production managed to shoot the series from late August to Thanksgiving, following the new COVID-safety protocols). As the series takes place just prior to the pandemic outbreak, perhaps the second season will see how the four friends fair during the pandemic.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2021/09/11/on-the-verge-new-netflix-series-created-by-julie-delpy/,‘On The Verge’: New Netflix Series Created By Julie Delpy
"SOUTH BEND, IN - SEPTEMBER 01: Head coach Brian Kelly of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish looks on ... [+] prior to their game against the Michigan Wolverines at Notre Dame Stadium on September 1, 2018 in South Bend, Indiana. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) No matter what the Twitterverse thought of Brian Kelly’s failed attempt at postgame humor last Sunday night in Tallahassee, his Notre Dame football players didn’t give it much thought.  “We just laughed it off,” star pass rusher Isaiah Foskey said this week as the eighth-ranked Irish prepared for Saturday’s home opener against Toledo. “We didn’t really understand it, but we all knew he wasn’t serious about it.” So, there was no fear of mass execution in the Irish football facility this week after a narrow escape in overtime against unranked Florida State in the season opener?  “No, no, no,” Foskey said with a laugh. “That’s not the plan. He did not mean that.”  As you may have heard, Kelly, now in his 12th season at the helm, stumbled through an on-air homage to John McKay, the late USC and Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach who wielded humor as effectively as any football coach ever.  Lacking a proper setup, Kelly started off his encounter with ESPN’s sideline reporter Katie George by saying he was “in favor of execution” and then clunkily followed that up with a suggestion that “maybe our entire team needs to be executed after tonight.”  Wait, what?  McKay’s classic line, as ESPN play-by-play man Joe Tessitore quickly reminded his TV audience, came in response to a question regarding what he thought about the execution of his offense. Depending on the retelling, McKay either deadpanned he was “in favor of it” or thought it was a “good idea.”  Decades later, the 59-year-old running things in South Bend, Ind., got blasted nationally for A) His apparent disregard for his players’ feelings and/or civil rights B) Insensitivity toward all those who have been executed throughout history and C) Stepping all over the punch line of a joke better saved for those offseason fundraisers with back-slapping boosters.  Double entendre much, coach?  “I know some people probably thought he was serious about it, but he came back with the team and explained himself,” Foskey said. “He knew everyone saw it.” The better McKay line for Kelly to appropriate, as it turned out, would have been the old saw about how his team didn’t block very well but made up for it by not tackling. Had Kelly used that line instead, perhaps he wouldn’t have spent a big chunk of his postgame news conference defending his clunky dad joke.  “It wasn’t funny? It was taken serious? Are you people crazy?” Kelly said. “Nobody likes to be funny anymore.”  Kelly’s players vouched for his acerbic sense of humor in the strange aftermath.  “I think he’s hilarious, personally,” said fifth-year senior placekicker Jonathan Doerer, who delivered the game-winning field goal from 41 yards. “I know his job makes it difficult to relax, but when he can, I think he’s really funny.” So, no carryover? TAMPA, FL - CIRCA 1981: Head coach John McKay of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers looks on during an NFL ... [+] football game circa 1981 at Tampa Stadium in Tampa Bay, Florida. McKay coached the Buccaneers from 1976-84. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)  “None of us took it that seriously,” Doerer said. “I can understand if people don’t know him that well and don’t know the team’s relationship with him, but I thought it was funny.” Sophomore tight end Michael Mayer noted Kelly didn’t do much joshing during the recruiting process — “Recruiting is more of a serious thing” — but the future pro from Northern Kentucky gave high marks to his coach’s comedic timing.  “Coach Kelly’s got a very good sense of humor,” Mayer said. “Personally, he says jokes to me all the time that I find pretty funny and he says jokes to the whole team that everybody finds pretty funny. I don’t think he ever means any harm. He’s a funny guy.” As for Foskey, the product of the Bay Area had somehow never heard of McKay, the college football Hall of Famer, before Kelly’s odd ode. When Foskey thinks of football coaches and humor, he goes right to Justin Alumbaugh, his old high school coach at Concord (Calif.) De La Salle. “He’s one of those serious/funny-type of people,” Foskey said. “I don’t know how to describe it. You know he’s serious but at the same time he knows how to joke.” And Kelly?  “He’s funny sometimes, but yeah, he’s got some dry humor,” Foskey said. “He makes me laugh sometimes.” You might say it’s all in the execution.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeberardino/2021/09/11/really-brian-kelly-is-funny---just-ask-his-notre-dame-football-players/,"Really, Brian Kelly Is Funny — Just Ask His Notre Dame Football Players"

"Can Alex Palou regain the IndyCar points lead? He feels confident heading into the Grand Prix of ... [+] Portland. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler) Since testing on July 30th, Alex Palou has seen himself drop from IndyCar points leader into second place. And none of it has been his fault.  Palou, the 24-year-old Spaniard racing in his sophomore year in IndyCar, sounds too upbeat. Nice, approachable, and energetic, he sounds anything like someone that has dropped from 1st to 2nd in the standings. Maybe it’s because he knows he’s still consistently a great driver. Maybe it’s because after dropping out of 1st, he knows it’s not his fault. Back to that July 30th testing session at Portland International Raceway, he was feeling good. Then, the car went into inspection. On August 6th, IndyCar officials announced a six-position starting grid penalty for Palou’s No. 10 Chip Ganassi Racing entry for an unapproved engine change following the testing at PIR. That penalty was assessed for the Big Machine Music City Grand Prix on Sunday, Aug. 8 in Nashville, Tennessee. Palou was able to eke out a 7th place finish, but with Scott Dixon finishing 2nd, it closed the gap in Palou’s points lead to 42 points. In the case of groundhog’s day, his No. 10 Chip Ganassi Racing entry got hit with a nine-position grid penalty for the same engine change rule following the Big Machine Spiked Coolers Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course. At that race, Palou’s points lead dwindled further when his engine failed him while running 4th on lap 68. That had him finish 27th, the lowest of the season for him at the time. “It’s frustrating when you have grid penalties when we don’t get a benefit from,” Palou said. “We didn’t change the engine because we have many miles on it to get more power. We changed the engine because we blew up the engine. So, [with the two penalties] there’s been some bad luck with that. Again, it’s just frustrating because the engine changes didn’t give us any benefits.” The problems mounted when Rinus VeeKay caused a multi-car crash at Gateway when drivers checked up on a restart that collected Palou, knocking him out of 1st in the standings. “Obviously, it’s something that happened that’s not our fault,” Palou tells me. “We were doing a really good job, going from 21st to 10th. That took hard work. And then suddenly we’re taken out… It hurts. It’s not a good feeling but there’s nothing we can do now. We have to focus and the next races. I think, overall, the crash was frustrating, but overall, the Chip Ganassi team was strong.”. While Palou has dropped into 2nd in the overall standings, there is reason to be optimistic. Choosing to test at Portland should give the Ganassi team good data to work with for qualifying and the race. “We lucky enough to have Portland as one of our test days, “Palou says. “Testing is so very important because we don’t get many days to do so. We wanted to learn more about the car at [Portland International Raceway], and we were able to get very comfortable. We’re looking forward to racing there. We believe we can have a really strong weekend.”  After the Grand Prix of Portland, Palou and Chip Ganassi Racing will have the IndyCar series return to Laguna Seca, followed by the final race of the season at Long Beach.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2021/09/11/alex-palou-looks-to-regain-indycar-championship-lead-at-portland-with-very-strong-weekend/,Alex Palou Looks To Regain IndyCar Championship Lead At Portland With ‘Very Strong Weekend’
"'Malignant' Alas, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is not a “rising tide lifts all boats” movie. Not that it has to be, mind you, but it is worth noting amid the (not entirely incorrect) “Marvel’s Shang-Chi proves theaters aren’t dead!” celebrations over the last week. For example, this weekend in 2019 had both the $38 million second-weekend gross of It Chapter Two (following an $89 million Fri-Sun debut) and the $32 million launch of Hustlers, which would leg out to $109 million domestic. The overall domestic box office will be around $58 million, with 55% from Shan-Chi alone and a 49% down from this frame in 2019.  Of course, in pre-Covid times, a film like James Wan’s buzzy and over-the-top horror original Malignant (review) may have had a shot in hell at breaking out. In a skewed irony, I’m 94% sure that this weekend will be the first time where the top two movies are both helmed by Asian filmmakers. While Destin Daniel Cretton’s MCU flick is kicking butt, James Wan’s Malignant is... not. The (surprisingly great, in terms of its smaller-scale publicity campaign and held-to-the-last-minute press screenings) R-rated original chiller earned just $2 million yesterday for a likely $5.2 million weekend. Assured future cult classic status notwithstanding, that’s not exactly a #GoldOpen. MELISSA BARRERA as Vanessa and ANTHONY RAMOS as Usnavi in 'IN THE HEIGHTS' I’d like to think that a new, $40 million (with every penny onscreen dammit) original horror spectacular from the man who directed Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring, Furious 7 and Aquaman would have been a bigger deal in non-Covid times. But, hell, it’s not like Warner Bros. wasn’t been struggling even pre-Covid with releasing old-school movies (often very good and/or inclusive studio programmers no less) to mostly empty auditoriums. I gave them grief (justifiably, from a commercial point of view) for The Suicide Squad, but at some point it’s the audiences’ responsibility to actually show up for flicks like Reminiscence and In the Heights.  Or, if you don’t show up for The Way Back you don’t get to complain about Space Jam: A New Legacy. Malignant, about a woman (Annabelle Wallis) plagued by visions of gruesome murders committed by a third-party, is exactly the kind of studio-backed “one for me” flicks we should want from our big-scale blockbuster directors. Furious 7 ”saved” the Fast Saga after Paul Walker’s untimely death (that the movie works as well as it does is a miracle), The Conjuring 2 cemented The Conjuring Universe as the first successful post-MCU cinematic universe and Aquaman ”saved” the DC Films franchise after the Justice League fiasco.  Aquaman James Wan could have spent $40 million in studio money for a movie co-written by his wife Ingrid Bisu (along with Akela Cooper) made only to be shown at private parties amid friends and still been fine and dandy. At worst, it’s a down-payment on Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom. There was hope two years ago that Wan’s blockbusters and popular horror hits would help make Malignant into a breakout original, essentially cementing him as a marquee director at least for horror, but Covid arguably put the kibosh on that. The film earned a 77% fresh and 6.6/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and a C (not awful for horror) Cinemascore grade.  The movie is already becoming a buzzy “see it before everyone spoils its twists” cult item at least in horror movie circles. I’ll be very curious as to if its HBO Max viewership numbers end up above the two million-household ceiling for non-event films. In normal times, a $40 million flick opening to $5 million would be an unmitigated disaster. While it’s still not “good,” the film’s “Look what we let our favorite filmmakers do!” existence can be exhibit A on convincing Chris Nolan to stick with Warner Bros. However, the gulf between the MCU flick and everything else is the definition of a good news/bad news situation.  Focus Features’ The Card Counter opened yesterday in 580 locations. Writer/director Paul Schrader’s newest “slow cinema” flick, starring Oscar Isaac as a convict-turned card shark who, well, this really isn’t a movie concerned with plot, earned $420,000 yesterday. That sets the dramatic thriller, co-starring Tiffany Haddish and Tye Sheridan, up for a likely $1.05 million opening weekend. That’s obviously not “good,” but it’s not like it would have broken out in normal times either. Even First Reformed, which had rave reviews and at least some awards season buzz, earned just $3.4 million in summer 2018. The Card Counter is pretty good as long as you understand that this isn’t Rounders.

"Tuscan vines, Italy Both Tuscany—located in central/northern Italy—and the island of Sicily— southernmost in the country—share sun-drenched vintages that generally produce rich, hearty, full bodied red wines.

"Katy (Awkwafina) and Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios. ©Marvel Studios 2021.  Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) topped the domestic box office for the second Friday in a row, earning $9.7 million for a $119.5 million domestic total. That’s a drop of 67% from its $29.5 million opening day, which means the Simu Liu-starring Marvel movie is playing, like, well, a Marvel movie. That 68% drop is more or less equal to the likes of Ant-Man, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel. Sure, it’s a bigger Friday drop than Black Panther (-62%) but it’s a better hold than Captain America: Civil War (-74%) and Black Widow (-80%). We’re likely looking at a $33 million (-56%) second weekend, which again is right in the realm of “normal” for a big Marvel movie.  That 56% drop would be right on par with previous “big” Labor Day openers such as Transporter 2 and Jeepers Creepers 2, and it’s a better hold than Rob Zombie’s Halloween (-62% from a $30.5 million debut in 2007). As we saw with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt’s A Quiet Place part II this past May, solid weekday grosses may have siphoned off second-weekend earnings, as folks who wanted to check it out (or see it again) after the holiday weekend already did so. That’s not a problem as A) the overall grosses are perfectly strong and B) Shang-Chi would *love* to have a post-debut multiplier on par with A Quiet Place part II ($160 million from a $57 million Fri-Mon Memorial Day weekend debut).  Ben Schwartz in 'Sonic the Hedgehog' and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in 'Bad Boys For Life' We’re probably looking at a $143 million ten-day total, putting it within spitting distance of Sonic the Hedgehog ($146 million just before everything went to hell in 2020). If the domestic/overseas split remains as it was by Sunday (53/47), it’ll have around $267 million worldwide by tomorrow night. Presuming it doesn’t collapse after this weekend, it’ll almost certainly be the first movie to top $200 million domestic since Bad Boys for Life ($204 million from a $73 million Fri-Mon debut) in January 2020. Transporter 2 earned 1.43x its $30.3 million ten-day total, and a similar run would give Shang-Chi a $205 million cume. The biggest sign of success is that Disney has announced that the rest of its 2021 releases will get a theatrical window.  Walt Disney Animation’s Encanto will get 30 days of theatrical exclusivity when it opens on Thanksgiving weekend (which was more than enough for F9 and sends the toon to Disney+ on Christmas Eve), while the likes of West Side Story, The King’s Man, Eternals and The Last Duel will get at least 45 days exclusively in theaters. That doesn’t mean we’ve seen the last of “Premier Access” hybrid releases, and frankly it was perhaps a necessary evil for an unprecedented moment in time. But that Shang-Chi is essentially performing (at least in North America) about as well as it might have under non-Covid circumstances shows that at least some theatrical window can allow must-see films to play pretty close to “business as usual” even in unusual times.  FREE GUY Meanwhile in more evidence in favor of theatrical windows, 20th Century’s Free Guy (review) earned another $1.472 million (-38%) on its fifth Friday for a $97.5 million domestic cume. The buzzy and leggy Ryan Reynolds/Jodie Comer original should earn $5.2 million (-42%) to end day 31 just over the $101 million mark. And, yeah, it’s continuing to kick ass in China, having just passed Chris Nolan’s Tenet ($66.6 million last year) to be the third-biggest Hollywood grosser of 2020/2021 behind only Godzilla Vs. Kong ($188 million) and F9 ($216 million). No Time to Die just got cleared for a China release, while Shang-Chi and Eternals still wait for their fate. Just a reminder that, in normal times, none of these biggies would have *needed* China for box office success.  Universal and MGM’s Candyman (review) earned $1.38 million (-52%) on its third Friday for a likely $4.25 million (-59%) weekend and $47.4 million 17-day cume. Pre-Covid expectations aside, an over/under $55 million domestic cume puts it above Old ($47.7 million) and any horror flick this year save for A Quiet Place part II ($160 million) and The Conjuring 3 ($64 million). Without too much “correlation equals causation” speculation, I’d argue that Universal perhaps sees this film’s grosses as the likely Covid-specific ceiling for next month’s Halloween Kills (Halloween’s $159 million domestic gross from a $77 million notwithstanding) and is thus using the film (now getting a day-and-date release) to give Peacock a seasonal boost. Finally, Jungle Cruise will earn $2.1 million (-47%) for a $109.6 million domestic cume.

(Photo by THE FACT/Imazins via Getty Images) 27 songs appear on the Hot 100 for the first time this week, with almost all of them coming from Kanye West’s new album. Other musicians, such as Halsey, Meek Mill, Skrillex, Lil Baby and J Balvin also collect wins on Billboard’s ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. this time around, while two artists land new top 10 smashes. Here’s a look at five of the most important moves on this week’s Hot 100 singles chart. No. 1 - BTS - “Butter” It looked for a while like BTS’s “Butter” was about to vacate the top 10 on the Hot 100, as the tune continued to lose ground after Justin Bieber and The Kid Laroi claimed the No. 1 spot with their collaborative smash “Stay.” After that tune enjoyed four frames in charge of the tally, “Butter” vaults back to the summit thanks to the release of a remix featuring Megan Thee Stallion, another one of the biggest names in the music industry. “Butter” is now the first song to spend double-digits at No. 1 on the Hot 100 this year, and it is the first tune in U.S. history by a South Korean act to earn at least 10 turns atop the tally.  No. 6 - Kanye West - “Hurricane” As his new album Donda opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with the largest sales frame of 2021 (at least for the next few days), Kanye West also invades the Hot 100 with almost every track featured on his latest full-length. 23 songs featured on the rapper’s new set appear on the chart this frame, upping his career total to impressive highs. West also now stands out as one of a relatively small number of artists who have occupied at least 20 spaces on the Hot 100 at one time, and he claims the fourth-most spots on the ranking at once. West’s highest-ranking song is “Hurricane,” which launches at No. 6. He charts two new top 10s this frame, with “Jail” opening at No. 10. No. 9 - Walker Hayes - “Fancy Like” 11 weeks into its time on the Hot 100, Walker Hayes’ “Fancy Like” has finally lifted into the top 10, giving the country musician his first placement inside the loftiest and most important region on the tally. The track has become the relatively rare top 10 to emerge from the country field, and it helps set Hayes up for future success, as he is now a true star in the genre. No. 18 - Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar - “Family Ties” Just ahead of the release of his debut album The Melodic Blue (which is out now), Baby Keem released the set’s second single “Family Ties,” which is an appropriate title, considering the tune features famed rapper and Keem’s cousin Kendrick Lamar. Thanks in large part to the Grammy winner’s involvement, the cut debuts at No. 18, giving Keem his first top 40 smash on the Hot 100. No. 22 - Meek Mill - “Sharing Locations (ft. Lil Baby & Lil Durk)” Speaking of major hip-hop stars, the powerful team of Meek Mill, Lil Baby and Lil Durk start their collaborative single “Sharing Locations” inside the top 40, certifying the tune as a quick hit. The track is yet another top 40 for all involved, and it appears to front a new album from Mill.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/11/bts-kanye-west-kendrick-lamar-and-meek-mill-5-songs-making-moves-on-the-hot-100/,"BTS, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar And Meek Mill: 5 Songs Making Moves On The Hot 100"
"Evander Holyfield, at the age of 58, goes through a recent media workout.  If you thought the Oscar De La Hoya vs. Vitor Belfort matchup was a ridiculous idea, it doesn’t have anything on its replacement after De La Hoya contracted COVID-19. Now, 58-year-old Evander Holyfield, who was already training for another bout, will step in on short notice to fight the former MMA star. If you feel icky about watching this fight, you probably won’t be alone. Yet, you can make bets anyway. Here’s everything you need to know about Evander Holyfield vs. Vitor Belfort, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win. When it was De La Hoya vs. Belfort, the matchup seemed somewhat fair: one of the most popular boxers of the last three decades against a once-dangerous UFC light heavyweight champion who is now 44 years old. Now it’ll be Holyfield, one of the best 10 heavyweight champions in history who’s 58 years old, an impressive sports ambassador, and also a guy who hasn’t had a real fight in 10 years.  Yet, here they are. “Training is what I do. Like I tell the young people, if you do things right, it will work out for you. That works for older folks too,” Holyfield said his week. “Boxing is a game and I know how to prepare for it against Vitor Belfort. I’m sure if I was getting in his game, I’d be in trouble, but he’s getting into my game, so he’s in trouble.” There’s no doubt that if Belfort was facing the Holyfield of 20 years ago—heck, probably even 10 years ago—he’d have almost no chance to beat Holyfield. But now Belfort is the betting favorite. And for good reason. Holyfield is almost 60 years old.  “The king of the jungle is the lion, not the elephant,” Belfort said. “I’m smaller than Evander, but I’m the lion. Speed and power are more important than size.” When Mike Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. in a Triller exhibition last November, it ended up being a fun event to watch. The same goes for the recent contests of YouTube stars Jake and Logan Paul. It remains to be seen whether there will be any fun in watching Holyfield vs. Belfort, but I guess we’ll find out soon enough.  Here’s more info on the Evander Holyfield vs. Vitor Belfort showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on Triller PPV for $49.99 beginning at 7 p.m. ET. Vitor Belfort, originally scheduled to fight Oscar De La Hoya, is a former UFC light heavyweight ... [+] champion.  When it was De La Hoya vs. Belfort, the MMA fighter was the +162 underdog. But against Holyfield, Belfort is the solid betting favorite. As of this writing, Belfort was the -275 favorite (bet $275 to win $100), while Holyfield was the +230 underdog (win $230 on a $100 wager). Keep in mind that the money lines have shifted dramatically in the past few days. When the bout was first announced, Holyfield was -140 and Belfort was +110.  Holyfield had an amazing career, beating Mike Tyson, George Foreman, Riddick Bowe, Larry Holmes and Michael Moorer. Even at the age of 48, he was good enough to beat a former solid journeyman in Brian Nielsen. Yes, he lost to some of the best fighters of his generation as well, but Holyfield finished with a record of 44-10-2 (29 KOs). Belfort is 1-0 as a professional boxer, having knocked out a no-hoper 15 years ago. Belfort made his money and fame in the octagon, amassing an MMA record of 26-14 with 18 stoppages. Included in his 21-year MMA career, he won the UFC light heavyweight title by beating Randy Couture in 2004. Belfort, though, lost his belt back to Couture seven months later, and he failed three other times when trying to win a UFC championship.  I’ll be honest. I have no idea who’s going to win this fight. And I don’t even want to pick, because I don’t feel good that this fight is even occurring. So, my only prediction is that the fight will go over 5.5 rounds (you can get that at -115). Hopefully, everybody walks away from this fight as healthy as possible.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2021/09/11/evander-holyfield-vs-vitor-belfort-odds-records-prediction/,"Evander Holyfield Vs.

"AEW All Out marked unforgettable moments for CM Punk, Bryan Danielson and Adam Cole. AEW’s latest pay-per-view All Out, which featured the in-ring return of CM Punk after a seven-year hiatus and the debuts of Bryan Danielson and Adam Cole, easily generated the most PPV buys in company history Tony Khan, AEW President, revealed on Busted Open Radio (h/t WrestlingNews.co) that the newsworthy event easily topped the 200,000 buy mark: “It’s great to be able to tell you guys that our pay-per-view did well over 200,000 buys which is a big milestone that nobody had hit in this country for a long time so it’s a pretty special week for AEW.” The Wrestling Observer’s Bryan Alvarez (h/t Cageside Seats) added that this is a “’low-end estimate,’ and the actual buyrate will be higher when it is known in a few months.” All Out was one of the most memorable non-WWE pay-per-views in recent memory, and as it turns out, one of the most purchased, too. Though the official PPV buy total has yet to be determined, that 200,000-plus number would easily top AEW’s previous high of an estimated 135,000 buys for this year’s Revolution show, according to Wrestlenomics (h/t SEScoops). WWE’s pay-per-view model has drastically changed since the launch of the WWE Network in 2014, so there isn’t an easy comparison here. But Brandon Thurston of WrestleNomics noted on Twitter that All Out would likely be the most-watched non-WWE pay-per-view since 1999 and would have topped a number of WWE events that took place in 2012 and 2013 near the end of the pre-WWE Network era: Instead of hosting monthly pay-per-views the way that many major pro wrestling promotions have over the past several decades, AEW has run quarterly PPV events mixed in with TV specials airing during Dynamite. While AEW’s pay-per-views traditionally haven’t drawn anywhere near what WWE was doing nearly a decade ago, the huge spike in PPV buys for All Out is impressive and a surefire sign that AEW’s momentum is on the upswing after the post-All Out episode of Dynamite drew big numbers as well. AEW has bolstered its roster with the likes of Danielson, Cole and Punk over the past few weeks, continuing the company’s trend of adding big names to its growing roster following the recent additions of ex-WWE stars like Andrade El Idolo and Malakai Black.  Now comes the hard part for AEW, however: Keeping that momentum going. AEW has utilized a number of its biggest surprises over the past couple of months, and those surprises have gotten over in a major way with pro wrestling’s diehard fan base. Already boasting a jam-packed roster, AEW no longer needs to worry about adding more talent and should instead focus on maintaining the huge audience it was able to attract for All Out. That event showed that AEW’s audience is growing considerably. In fact, SEScoops really put that number into perspective, noting—in rather ironic fashion—that WWE hasn’t topped 200,000 buys since Danielson, as Daniel Bryan, main evented WrestleMania 30 back in 2014: “The Money in the Bank 2011 PP from Chicago which featured John Cena vs CM Punk brought in an estimated 146,000 buys. The last WWE PPV to bring in more than 200K buys was WrestleMania 30 (420,000 buys) which featured Daniel Bryan winning the WWE Championship in the main event.” Danielson and Punk are now positioned as two of the biggest draws in AEW, WWE’s closest competitor, and they will undoubtedly be relied upon to carry AEW’s PPV torch over the next few years.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2021/09/11/aew-all-out-generated-well-over-200000-pay-per-view-buys/,"AEW All Out Generated ‘Well Over’ 200,000 Pay-Per-View Buys"
"REVELXP turnkey tailgating at University of Oklahoma With a presence at more than 60 collegiate and professional stadiums nationwide, game day experience company REVELXP is expanding on the turnkey tailgating concept this season and fans are responding enthusiastically. Turnkey tailgating provider REVELXP, says it has sold more than 90 percent of its inventory for the following games:    In addition, all full season tailgating packages at University of Georgia have sold out.  “The enthusiasm fans are showing for turnkey tailgating and premium hospitality experiences is unlike any previous season,” said Ray DeWeese, CEO of REVELXP. “We are excited about partnering with the nation’s most beloved universities to safely celebrate the return of fans and together, create the rich and rewarding experiences that we missed last season.” REVELXP is was founded in 2020 under the Teall Sports & Entertainment umbrella to combine several established sports and entertainment companies, including Tailgate Guys, PRE, Colonnade, Complex Sports and Rhino Sports & Entertainment. Its turnkey tailgates include reserved tailgates in premium game day locations, tents, tables, chairs, coolers, food from local favorites and beverage services, satellite TVS, reserved parking and day-of bellhops to help carry any additional needs. Their accommodate groups as small as five fans up to 1,000. Turnkey tailgating at Texas A&M “We're adding a lot of additional value items to packages. The food and beverage offerings will start to look fairly different this year, including some of the things that we're including with the packages, whether that's the option for a Bumpboxx, ice shakers, or some of these other add-ons that we've that we've thrown in.” Another big change DeWeese says is taking the focus off only serving the traditional turnkey tailgating model and instead creating more experiences that are open to anyone. “We've created outdoor breweries, which are more of a general admission type of a ticket. We've created at Ole Miss a pavilion experience where the pavilion is their basketball arena, which is situated right outside of football stadium. There will be an indoor access point for that where it’s an individual ticket experience, not a turnkey tailgating area.” The concept at Ole Miss involves a strategic partnership that makes REVELXP the official experience provider and Dyehard Fan Supply, another Teall Sports brand, the official merchandise provider for Ole Miss Athletics. Through this partnership, REVELXP is creating fan experiences on game day, while Dyehard manages and operates the official e-commerce, in-venue and store merchandising programs, including a custom game day shopping experience in The Grove for the first time ever. “Ole Miss represents a unique opportunity to transform both the in-venue and the e-commerce merchandising programs in a holistic, unified way with our colleagues at REVELXP,” said Scott Killian, CEO of Dyehard Fan Supply. “Never before has merchandising been so highly integrated with hospitality and tailgating experiences to create a seamless, elevated fan experience.” Rendering of the new field-level pre-game and in-game experience New experiences at Ole Miss for the 2021 season include:   “Coming to a game at Ole Miss is a bucket list item for any sports fan,” said Keith Carter, Ole Miss Vice Chancellor for Intercollegiate Athletics. “As we look at welcoming fans back to our venues this fall, Teall Sports & Entertainment understands our vision and is bringing new and exciting ideas to the table. As has been said, The Grove is the country’s greatest tailgating destination, and this partnership with REVELXP and Dyehard Fan Supply will ensure that the rest of our game day experience achieves that same level of excitement.” The partnership will extend beyond football season to other private events and premium experiences year-round, including the addition of a multi-tier fan experience in the Swayze Field outfield during baseball season and a Premium Viewing Deck with seating, deck rails and other premium services. DeWeese says offerings and capabilities will vary by school and be customized for each based on their infrastructure and unique fan appetite. “What we found is people really enjoyed the turkey tailgating side, so how could we expand on that and look at the experience overall? It starts with working with each one of these partners and doing an audit to look at what is available today, talking with their fan base on what may be available later that we can help with, and then just creating that stuff from a really collaborative and specific approach to each individual school because of the history with all the individual schools.”  “Whether it’s The Grove at Ole Miss or fan walks all over the country that are different, we don’t want to disrupt that. We just want to amplify it and help people interact with it.” Gator Walk Village is expanding from 18 tents to 38 this season due to fan demand For example, REVELXP is creating a new Kenan Pines experience at UNC, located in the woods at Kenan Stadium between Gates 2 and 3, that’s going to have more of a sports bar feel. “Where turnkey tailgating has historically been at the Bell Tower, that won’t change. Now we just have other options.” DeWeese says bringing all the sports and entertainment brands under the REVELXP umbrella allows the company to make some big changes to the fan experience. “We want to revolutionize the fan experience. If you look at all of the acquisitions that have been made, they all tie back to that in some way, shape or fashion.” “There has been a steady decline in fan attendance, and it wasn’t just competition of other things in the marketplace from a sports and entertainment perspective, but also from 75” TV, having food delivered to your house and homegating. People were still showing that they wanted to consume live events, but there was a disconnect between the offerings on campus and what we thought needed to be there.” DeWeese says they really paid attention to how the younger demographic wanted to experience a game. “They weren’t as apt to graduate, join the alumni association, donate and get their season tickets. They were much more looking at the secondary ticket market, setting up tailgates, because they want to experience things with their friends or family and shared in that experience. “That's actually where ‘Revel’ in our name came from. ‘Revel’ came from the idea that when you look back on things, you revel in those times. Those memories of being at the big game against a rival where we won or lost, you reveled in that at some point during the time that that game was going on.” Moving forward, REVELXP is focused on working in both college and professional sports to maximize fan engagement, identify new revenue streams and successfully welcome back fans to stadiums this season.

"On September 11, 2001, 5,000 aircraft were carefully guided to the ground in under two hours in ... [+] response to the attacks. It happens every single time. Whenever I tell anyone that my father, Arnold Palumbo, is an Air Traffic Controller, I receive the same response: ""Wow. That's a stressful job."" And it can be. Whether dealing with high levels of traffic, bad weather, or emergencies, there are variables every day that may arise. Throughout his career, he dealt with everything ranging from conflicts between pilots and controllers to tragic plane crashes. When I think back, though, while the job could be incredibly stressful, I don't recall him being stressed. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employs more than 14,000 air traffic controllers (ATC). They guide pilots and the planes they fly and handle approximately 2.7 million daily passengers from taxi to takeoff. Because of the intensity of this role, zero margins for error, the training regimen, and proficiencies needed to become a controller are equally demanding. You have to pass a medical examination, a security investigation, an FAA air traffic pre-employment test and more. Every controller is thoroughly vetted and trained to deal with many types of unexpected situations. However, on September 11th, 2001, the entire FAA had to deal urgently, efficiently, and safely with an event no one had ever experienced in air traffic history while it was unfolding. As I would learn in researching this piece, while the tragic events of that day were completely unprecedented, the training ATC's received was key in reacting swiftly and coming up with solutions to problems happening in real-time. Those skills made it possible for around 5,000 aircraft to be carefully guided to the ground in under two hours on September 11, 2001. ""There was no precedent,"" my father explained. He is now a retired Operational Manager in New York. On September 11, my dad was in an administrative role responsible for airspace in the LaGuardia and Islip area in New York. ""It's a credit to the air traffic controllers that planes were landed safely and quickly without incident."" It's twenty years later, and while there are many heroes and quick-thinking actions from that day, highlighting the FAA's tremendous ability to shut down U.S. airspace completely without a roadmap to follow should be part of that conversation. Arnold Palumbo was an Operational Manager at the New York TRACON as En-Route Air Traffic Controller ... [+] from 1981 – 2002 My father worked at the New York TRACON as En-Route Air Traffic Controller from 1981 – 2002. The TRACON's airspace makes the radar departures and arrivals to all of the airports in the Metropolitan area. The NY Center/Boston Center is above them in air space. ""We were in a meeting, and someone came in saying there was a hijacking,"" said Palumbo. ""I went to see what was happening, and we were told the plane was at 29,000 thousand feet and had turned off the transponder. When you shut off the transponder, you can't identify the aircraft's call sign, altitude, or speed. So we only knew it was a blip on the screen that we needed to try and follow. So we thought that the plane was just flying overhead, and we'll keep an eye on him."" This plane would turn out to be American 11. Despite best efforts, they ended up losing track of the hijacked plane. Not long after, the controllers in the LaGuardia section received reports that the World Trade Center had been hit. It was at that point that a supervisor in a different area turned to the watch desk and said, ""We have a No Radio Airplane who we have no control over. I'm afraid he's going to hit the second building."" Meanwhile, in Herndon, Virginia, Ben Sliney had just begun his first day (yes, his very first day) as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Manager in the Air Traffic Control Systems Command. ""I had been informed of a hijacking right before a meeting. So I asked someone on my team to keep me appraised,"" said Sliney. ""Within several minutes, he came into the meeting and told me we had information that a flight attendant may have been stabbed. That's when I immediately went to the floor and took command of the operation."" Ben Sliney during 2006 Cannes Film Festival - ""United 93"" Premiere at Palais des Festival in Cannes, ... [+] France. (Photo by Toni Anne Barson/WireImage) Mr. Sliney shared that they had CNN on in the command center at the time. It was there that they saw the news about the first tower being hit. Then, as Sliney's team tried to call the NYC police to determine what kind of plane it was that hit the building, they watched, as we all did, United 175 make a steep turn and crash into the second tower. ""Once the second plane crashed, years of training as an air traffic controller kicked in,"" Palumbo stated. ""Everyone attempted to stop all arrivals and departures in the tri-state area within minutes."" ""Right after United 175 hit, that's when I issued a nationwide ground stop."" Sliney recollected. This was the first time that had ever happened in the United States Aviation history. ""All the airborne aircraft were landed at the nearest airport by the best air traffic controllers on earth. Pilots were advised to secure their cockpits immediately, but the only thing we told them was that it was a national emergency.""

Boitano/Getty Images) On November 12, 2001, only two months after the September 11 attacks, an American Airlines flight out of John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport in New York City crashed into a Queens neighborhood, killing 265 people. Although some initially speculated the crash was another terrorist act, it turned out to be a combination of pilot error and wind conditions. ""We had the same reaction as everybody else,"" my father said. ""We were afraid it was terrorism-related. On September 11, we didn't know what was going on, so there was some hesitancy. Post-September 11, with the crash in Queens, we were able to quickly determine what had happened and just wanted to make sure that nothing was going to affect any rescue efforts."" A few days after the crash in Queens and in light of the September 11 attacks, the president signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act on November 19, 2001, which among other provisions, established a new agency responsible for aviation security. The November 2002 passage of the Homeland Security Act moved TSA into the new Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003. As we know now, Al-Qaeda has been responsible for multiple terrorist attacks since it was founded in 1980. In 1996, bin Laden declared a jihad against the United States. bin Laden's goal was to get the U.S. to withdraw from the Muslim world. Yet, while U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies had been monitoring bin Laden and al-Qaeda during the 1990s, senior U.S. policymakers did not seem to consider al-Qaeda a priority. This is something Sliney wished had been different. Both Sliney and Palumbo walked me through how you are trained as an ATC that when a crisis happens, you are to collect all the information and act accordingly. However, Sliney feels that, in retrospect, he didn't have all the intel needed. ""The government knew Al Queda might have been a threat, but it was never communicated to the FAA. So, when everything happened, Al-Qaeda wasn't on my mind at all. If I had been alerted at the highest levels previously, I would have shut down the whole damn system when the first aircraft was hijacked! I just recall looking at that hole in the World Trade Center and thinking, 'No pilot would ever do that intentionally.’ Their jobs are to minimize the loss of life in a life-threatening event. But unbeknownst to me, I simply wasn't operating with all of the information.""  NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 11: Family members of victims gather at the North Pool of the 9/11 ...

New York City and the nation are commemorating the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people after two hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia and one crash landed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. (Photo by David Handschuh-Pool/Getty Images) Overall, Sliney and Palumbo agreed that the events of September 11 could never happen again. In addition to increased security and protocols in place, as Sliney said, ""The passengers wouldn't tolerate it."" In speaking with my dad, one of the biggest things he wanted to highlight was that he was strictly in an administrative role that day. So, while he was there observing everything and handling phone calls, he felt that it is the air traffic controllers that deserve much praise. ""When it comes to Air Traffic Controllers, you just can't have a 'bad apple,"" my father said. ""While men like Sliney made the crucial decisions when the time came that day to act, it was the controllers who responded, did the right thing, and landed everyone safely."" So yes, being an air traffic controller can be stressful, but even under the most unexpected, tragic, and difficult days, they were able to leverage their training and calmly take every action necessary. Sliney agrees. ""It was a magnificent accomplishment – the pilot, flight attendants, everyone across the board. The whole aviation system responded beautifully."" When I asked Sliney what stays with him the most twenty years later, he answered, ""The way nobody has forgotten. That was the mantra at the time – never forget. The country came together post 9/11, and even though there's been much divisiveness in recent years in general, when it comes to September 11, we really have never forgotten the events or the lives lost.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferpalumbo/2021/09/11/air-traffic-controllers-look-back-at-the-september-11-us-attacks/,Air Traffic Controllers Look Back At The September 11 U.S. Attacks
"A flag shows where American flight 77 was crashed into the pentagon on 9/11. These attacks affected ... [+] the world and the airline industry in significant ways., I drove to work as US Airway’s senior vice president of marketing on the morning of 9/11, still bothered by the fact that the New York Giants had lost to the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football the evening before. It was a nice morning and driving down the GW Parkway was one of the nicest commutes I’ve had in my career, with sites of the Potomac River, and many of D.C.’s notable monuments in view. Like everyday in this role, there were a lot of meetings scheduled and more to do than time to do it. Nothing seemed unusual. But we all know what happened that morning, and on its 20th anniversary there have been many stories and remembrances, and lots of thinking about how that morning changed so many things in the world. Here is how things unfolded from my office at the airline’s headquarters. US Airways was based in a nondescript high-rise building in Crystal City, Virginia, and occupied several floors. I worked on the fourth floor in the center. Our head of pricing, Stephen Usery, had his office at the far end of the hall. Stephen had a television in his office which he generally kept on business news. Within minutes of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, we were aware of what happened and watched the video shown on the television. The initial report was that a “small plane” had hit the north tower.  Just after 9am, when the second plane hit the south tower, two things were clear: it was not a small plane, it was a commercial jet, and this was an attack, not an accident. At this point, Stephen looked looked at me and said, “it must be Osama Bin Laden.” It surprised me that he seemed so certain, but then we talked about the earlier failed attempt to down the towers with truck bombs in 1993. By this point, most of our colleagues who worked on the floor were discussing the events. I called a group together to see what we could or should do in response, as my team was responsible for the company’s website and we felt that’s where most customers would go for answers. No US Airways plane was used in the attacks, so we did not have direct customer issues related to the attack at that time. The third plane crashed into the Pentagon about 30 minutes later, only about a mile from our building. After three attacks, it seemed clear that this was aimed at big image targets and one person wondered out loud if the Pentagon bombing was a backup for a plan to hit a more emotional target like the Capitol or the White House. At this point, I called my wife, who was the principal of an elementary school in Alexandria, Virginia. I got hold of her and asked if she knew what happening, and she told me that her school was being put into a lockdown. This meant no one could leave or enter, but at that point most of the school was unaware of the outside events.  As I walked out of my office, another colleague came to to me, visibly shaken, saying that she had come to the office late because of an early morning dentist appointment and saw the plane hit the Pentagon on her drive in. She was listening to her radio so knew what had just happened in New York. Then, we got word from our System Operations Center that the airspace in the U.S. was being shut down for commercial traffic and that all aircraft on the air were ordered to land at the closest airport. For an airline, this was shocking news but certainly seemed appropriate since it was not clear how many more planes would be used as bombs. We also knew that we would have many customer issues to deal with as the the rest of the day’s flights were cancelled and many people would be landing at spots other than their chosen destination.  When the fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania, it was confusing. Only later would we hear about the heroes on that flight who wouldn't allow their hijackers to reach their intended target. This crash created a new concern, though, as it was unclear if there were more planes that had been commandeered. This “is it over?” feeling lasted for hours until the media seemed confident that planes had landed and there were no more known instances of hijackings.  The day’s schedule was obviously thrown out by then, and the rest of the day was a series of meetings dealing with customer issues, aircraft issues, and crew issues. While no US Airways planes were used in the attacks, we had flights returning from Europe that were forced to land in Canada and this gave our teams a lot to consider. U.S. airspace reopened to commercial traffic on September 13 for planes to get positioned back to where they should be. The flight scheduling, marketing, and operations teams worked to rebuild the schedule against a dramatically reduced number of bookings. The next few weeks were a whirlwind of activity, trying to understand what these events meant for the company, the industry, and the practical issues of employee and customer care. But Reagan National Airport, DCA, did not re-open and as this was one of US Airway’s most important operating bases, this was a big concern. Shuttle flights to NY and Boston were moved to Washington’s Dulles airport with DCA closed. The attacks temporarily closed the capital markets to airlines, as lenders felt the industry was far too risky. In response, the U.S. Treasury created the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) to provide credit to airlines. Airlines had to apply, and some were approved and others denied. US Airways received the largest loan, in part because of unique ways in which the attacks affected the carrier, including the long closure of DCA and the high dependence on short flights in and around the northeast. On November 12, an American flight from New York’s JFK airport crashed. The immediate thoughts about this was, “Oh no, is this another attack?” It is uncomfortable to say that there a was huge relief when it was determined this was unrelated to the previous attacks. On November 28, US Airways CEO Rakesh Gangwal unexpectedly resigned. Stephen Wolf, the Chairman of the company and one-time United Airlines CEO, took over daily running of the company while a search began for a new CEO. This leadership change added even more uncertainty to a company that just months earlier was planning to merge with United Airlines. DCA finally reopened in late October, but the company had been planning what to do in the event that the airport was permanently closed.  US Airways planes were not used in the 9/11 attacks but these attacks disproportionally affected the airline. Stephen Usery, our pricing head who had quickly and correctly guessed the source of the attacks, used his cynical wit to say that the company’s once proud aspiration to become a “world class global airline” should be now changed to “half-assed regional feeder.” This was unfortunately close to true. The ATSB loan helped to keep the company alive but US Airways still became the first airline to enter bankruptcy protection following the attacks. Eventually most airlines, with the notable exception of Southwest, used bankruptcy to restructure, change their fleets, and reject defined benefit pension plans for retired employees. These restructurings then led to a chain of mergers, in which eight large U.S. airlines became four huge airlines. These consolidations closed or significantly downsized multiple hubs in the U.S., raised fares for consumers, and created an environment that allowed ultra-low fare carriers like Spirit, which I served as CEO of from 2005-16, to flourish.  One thing that struck me, even on the day of the attacks, was the very light passenger loads on the airplanes. The attacks were on a Tuesday, which is the day of week with the fewest travelers. It is chilling to think that the planners of the attack actually considered this fact, as fewer passengers would mean less resistance to their take-overs. It also shows the calculated, callous, and unadulterated evil that propagated these attacks.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/benbaldanza/2021/09/11/the-morning-of-911-from-inside-the-us-airways-hdq-near-dca-airport/,The Morning Of 9/11 From Inside US Airways’ HQ Near Reagan National Airport
"Nikki Hiltz in May 2020. The New York Road Runners organization is celebrating a milestone this weekend: The 40th anniversary of an iconic race along 20 blocks of Manhattan’s most famous thoroughfare. With Central Park on their right, multi-million-dollar high-rise homes on their left, runners taking part in the New Balance 5th Avenue Mile will step off Sunday morning just south of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. They’ll race past the Central Park Zoo on their way to the finish line at Grand Army Plaza, just across from the iconic Plaza Hotel.  One of those runners is someone who just two weeks ago ran the mile faster than anyone else in Yakima, Wash.: Nikki Hiltz, a six-time All American and Adidas athlete from San Diego, Calif., taking part in their last event of 2021. They made headlines in the sports world and across the LGBTQ community when they came out as transgender nonbinary earlier this year on Instagram. Nikki Hiltz came out on Instagram on March 31, 2021.  “Sometimes I wake up feeling like a powerful queen and other days I wake up feeling as if I’m just a guy being a dude, and other times I identify outside of the gender binary entirely,” they wrote in their Instagram post. “It’s complicated and complex and something I’m still trying to navigate myself, but I’ve decided it’s time to share my gender fluidity with you all. Posting this is both exciting and terrifying but I am and always will be a firm believer that vulnerability and visibility are essential in creating social change and acceptance.” “I obviously have known about my gender my entire life,” Hiltz told me in a Zoom conversation shortly after Yakima. “I think it's just within the past two years, finally having the education and context for what that means, to not only articulate it to myself and to have those all moments myself, but to also tell the world that, too. This is something I've been wanting to share, just didn't really know how.” But this wasn’t the first time Hiltz had come out, they tweeted:  “So here I am, once again, coming out of a closet to be my true authentic self,” Hiltz wrote in that Instagram post. In our conversation, they explained that the closet door this time cracked opened after a 5K they created, and conversations with its runners.  “Last summer, 2020, when the world shut down, I decided to put on a race, and I wanted to have all the proceeds go to the Trevor Project. And at that time, I was essentially a closeted trans person, and really desperate to make this safe space for people in the community.” The first Nikki Hiltz Pride 5K was held June 28, 2020. “Nearly 2,000 people from around the world signed up,” Hiltz told RunnersWorld magazine. “People who had never run farther than two miles completed a 5K for the first time, and there was an entire family that ran the race together to celebrate a daughter who had recently come out.  This year’s Pride 5K raised more than $42K for the leading national nonprofit that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth.  Instagram post by Nikki Hiltz Pride 5K What surprised Hiltz, they said, was that many participants seized the event as an opportunity to come out. “I was making it for them, and not for me, until that space became that place for me,” said Hiltz. The stories of runners finally owning their truth inspired conversations, and the idea of a podcast. “I wanted to know their experience and how they used the race,” recalled Hiltz. “So, I decided to record my conversations with them and turn them into podcasts. And so my very first conversation, I was using this shitty app, and talking, not really knowing what I'm doing, but just having a conversation with someone, asking questions like, ‘How does it feel to come out?’ or ‘Walk me through that day,’ and things like that.” They made their decision. The next day just happened to be an important day on the calendar for the transgender community. “We have these days throughout the year, like National Coming Out Day in October or Pride Month in June, where people are having these conversations,” they said. “Trans Day of Visibility is one of those days. And I was like, ‘OK, perfect. I'm just going to jump on this. I'm ready. I'm going to do it.’ I guess that was the catalyst of using my running to create this race and then using that race to feel safe enough to come out; That’s kind of my journey with it.” Hiltz composed a post for Instagram and published it on March 31: Hiltz, 26, also credits the support of their parents and sister both as an athlete and in their identity. Clockwise from left to right: Liz Hiltz, Nikki Hiltz, Tom Hiltz and Michaela Hiltz. “My family is definitely my biggest support when it comes to me and my running and obviously, I've come out to them as well, and they're extremely loving and supporting in that way, too,” said Hiltz, while admitting that there have been bumps along the way, as far as their parents and pronouns. “It is because, I think, there is a generational difference. But they're always willing to learn and grow.” That’s the key, they said. “It's just a slow, slow learning process. But I feel like I'm very patient with them. And it's very different when someone's accidentally slipping up, versus intentionally trying to misgender me. And my family definitely does not do that.” Growing up in Santa Cruz, Calif., they said they knew they were different, even as young as six. Nikki Hiltz as a child “Six-year-old me expressed my gender identity through having short hair, wearing baseball caps, and refusing to wear dresses,” Hiltz wrote in an op-ed for RunningWorld. “I felt most like myself when I was playing football with the boys during recess, when my dad called me Nick instead of Nikki, and when the substitute teachers would mistake me for a boy.” Hiltz attended Aptos High School and is a University of Arkansas alum. They’ve been an avid runner for a decade, although in junior high, cross country and track weren’t taken seriously.  “That was such a joke,” they said. “We ran maybe a mile a day.” That all changed in their freshman year of high school, when Hiltz “got serious.”  “It sounds weird, but at this point, running is like my job,” they said. “But obviously, it wasn't always that. It was something that I felt I just fell in love with, that competitive side of it. Hiltz said they’re mindful of their future in the sport, and staying in shape. “Honestly, it's just my desire to want to be my best. And yeah, in a race, I just want to beat everyone around me.”  They certainly did that last month in Yakima, Wash., not only winning a race and its prize but breaking the women’s record for the fastest mile ever run in that state. Why Yakima? Hiltz said, it may seem “random,” but they named some valid reasons: “It had a really big prize purse, which is awesome. You know, not a lot of races have that much prize money. So I think that really attracted a lot of athletes to run it. And it was really fun! I ran well. I ran fast.” And it was “definitely slightly downhill,” Hiltz added, “but don’t tell anyone.” That victory two weeks ago propelled them to New York City, while many other runners are shutting down for the season after this long, grueling year. Hiltz said they wouldn’t miss this opportunity. “After Yakima,” said Hiltz, “I was like, ‘No, I want to keep going. I want to do that.’  “I love going there because I have a lot of fans and followers in New York and getting to connect with all those people before and after the race is so fun. And I can't think of a better city to end this very long, important season.” Nikki Hiltz, left, and girlfriend, runner Emma Gee, pose in Times Square, New York, N.Y. I asked Hiltz, why is that? What is it about New York that draws them here? “I think it's so wildly different than anything I've ever experienced,” they said. “I'm from Santa Cruz, California, which is like a small coastal beach town in Northern California. And I've lived in Oregon, in Arkansas for college, now back in California. But it's just so terrifying! Like there's no other word for it. You drive in from Newark or wherever you fly in from, and you're like, it's just chaos. But it's very exciting, especially just for a weekend. I don't know if I could live there. I think I could live there for, like, either one summer or like one year.” Wherever Hiltz goes, so goes girlfriend Emma Gee. They spent part of their visit to New York City touring Times Square and enjoying tennis at the U.S. Open at the stadium in Queens named for trailblazer Billie Jean King.  Nikki Hiltz, right, plants a kiss on Emma Gee at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Like Hilt, Gee is a runner and exudes positivity. Upon qualifying for nationals in June, she posted on Instagram that she achieved her goal: “For me, running was never about running. It was about building a good relationship with myself.”  Emma Gee, left, kisses Nikki Hiltz holding a rainbow Pride flag on the campus of Brigham Young ... [+] University. Gee was the first and only out LGBTQ student-athlete at Brigham Young University; She’s now a graduate student at Temple University and has shattered three school track records. Hiltz said Gee made their coming out as trans nonbinary so much easier than it would have been without her by their side.  “Emma's been, like, everything,” they said. “As soon as I met her, one of the first things we talked about was sexuality and, ‘How were your parents when you came out?’ things like that. How all queer relationships start, talking about your past trauma. But one of the first things she asked me was, ‘Tell me about your gender identity.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, okay.’  “She was the first person I ever really went ‘there’ with,” Hiltz said. “I can't think of anyone better who has been more supportive throughout this whole journey. She grew up Mormon, and if Emma can do the work to challenge the way she was conditioned to think, I think we all can do that as well. And so she's just been an inspiration of mine to do that.” Emma Gee, left, with Nikki Hiltz on her 24th birthday. Although Hiltz fell short of qualifying for the U.S. Olympic team this past summer, there were bright moments along with the darker ones.

But at the finals, with the temperature on the track recorded at 120 degrees, Hiltz fell short, literally: They got into a smash-up with another sprinter just after the starting gun, reported myhighplains.com, and never recovered. Hiltz dropped from fourth to last and finished 13th in the 1500-meter final, with a time of 4:10.60; They were more than nine seconds off their personal best and more than five seconds off their season best. The meet was won by Elle Purrier St. Pierre in a record and personal-best 3:58.03. Cory McGee finished second in a personal-best 4:00.67. Heather MacLean claimed Team USA’s final Olympic berth in the event with a time of 4:02.09. But even that disappointment, even when combined with an NBC analyst getting their pronouns wrong (and later publicly apologizing), the setback did not derail Hiltz’s abundant positivity.  In July, Hiltz shared with Instagram followers that, like Olympic athletes Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka, they’ve struggled with “what felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders.” In their case, it was the hatred directed at trans athletes and the pressure from anti-trans bigots that was at the center of Hiltz’s struggle. They came up with a plan with their coach and training partner to prioritize their mental health and well-being.  For now they’ve set their sights on qualifying for the next summer games in 2024 or 2028. “I think about Paris, or L.A. 2028 is really alluring because it's a U.S. Olympics and as an American, that would be really special to end my career there,” said Hiltz. “But that's like a fairy tale Cinderella story. I know that might not happen. And there's ups and downs in everyone's careers. But I think, ideally, I would want to be a professional runner through 2028 and then kind of close the book and start the next chapter.” Does that chapter include running a marathon, like the world-famous New York City Marathon? “I would love to do a marathon at some point,” Hiltz said, but added they wouldn’t want to run it competitively. “I would do it for fun, or maybe do it for a charity or something with a group of people.” And then they joked: But whatever else fills that chapter, Hiltz expects to be involved in sports even after they retire in 2024 or 2028.  “It's the first place where I ever felt like I can be myself,” they said. “I think, along my journey, sports has been at the forefront of discovering myself. I’ve discovered other, very incredible, inspirational stories all because I follow sports.” Follow Nikki Hiltz on Instagram by clicking here.

"In this illustration is displayed on a smartphone's screen the company logo of Air Liquide S.A., ... [+] which specialises in the supply of industrial gases and hydrogen chain services for various industries, is shown on the screen of a smartphone in front of a blue backdrop of the global stock markets and worldwide indices in Frankfurt, Germany, on 12th June, 2020. It is one of the global companies that provides comprehensive services in hydrogen production in the current alternative energy market. (Photo Illustration by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) This is the final article in a series that examines Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) programs in the oil industry, with an emphasis on how some companies are using hydrogen to improve their metrics. Previous articles were:   Today I want to talk about specific examples of how various companies are incorporating hydrogen into their businesses.  The genesis of this series came from a recent research piece from independent energy infrastructure and master limited partnership (MLP) market intelligence data provider Alerian: Midstream/MLPs: The Unsung ESG Push. The research piece covered a number of different initiatives, but I was particularly interested in learning what these companies are doing in the area of hydrogen. I inquired, and heard back from Mauricio Samaniego, Senior Research Analyst, Alerian and S-Network Global Indexes, who said: “As you may be aware, the recurring hydrogen theme for midstream has revolved around natural gas pipelines and storage facilities being used for the transportation and storage of blue or green hydrogen over the next decade.  Today, hydrogen initiatives are in very early stages and are mostly focused on blending hydrogen into existing natural gas pipelines, which has been set forth, explored, and/or discussed by Enbridge 
  
  ENB 
  (ENB), TC Energy (TRP), Kinder Morgan 
  
  KMI 
  (KMI), and The Williams Company 
  
  WMB 
  (WMB). Additionally, TRP and Enterprise Product Partners (EPD 
  
  EPD 
 ) have also discussed—and are evaluating—leveraging existing nuclear and petrochemical plants for hydrogen production.”  He included a number of bullet points delineating these hydrogen-related initiatives, some of which I have used in the commentary below. There are three readily accessible uses for hydrogen produced near a natural gas field. The first is compression. Midstream operators rely on compression to move natural gas from the field to the customer. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), a branch of the Department of Energy, estimates that there are 1,700 midstream natural gas pipeline compressor stations with a total of 5,000-7,000 compressors, approximately 13,000-15,000 smaller compressors in upstream, and 2,000-3,000 compressors (all sizes) in downstream oil & gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) applications. The DOE estimates that 2-3% of U.S. natural gas production is utilized by these compressors. (Source).  Among other companies, GE has developed hydrogen-fueled compressors. They currently have more than 100 units in the field operating on up to 100% hydrogen. So, a midstream operator could utilize hydrogen locally produced from underutilized products like ethane to improve ESG metrics. Industrial gas turbines are currently the prime mover of choice for most mainline applications. Each of these turbines emits carbon dioxide, and they are high-profile targets for ESG improvements. Within the next 15 years, an estimated 5 million horsepower of compression must be replaced. (Source).   Operators of gas-fired power plants are also in the crosshairs, with regulators and investors setting ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Power plant turbines can be operated using a blend of methane and up to 20% hydrogen to reduce CO2 emissions. Mitsubishi Power has announced development of turbines capable of operating on 100% hydrogen.  To get that hydrogen to the power plants, many midstream operators are testing the blending of hydrogen into natural gas pipelines. In its Q4 2020 earnings call, Kinder Morgan mentioned having the technology in place to blend hydrogen with natural gas and move it via its pipelines. Enbridge currently has two ongoing hydrogen projects, including a $5.2M hydrogen blending pilot project in Markham, Ontario and a $90 million, 20 MW hydrogen production and blending project in Gatineau in western Quebec. At a recent energy conference, Energy Products Partners mentioned evaluating hydrogen applications for transportation and storage—citing ongoing discussions with a petrochemical company regarding hydrogen pipeline and storage projects.  TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) is evaluating blending hydrogen into its existing pipeline, as well as adding dedicated hydrogen assets. On their Q1 2021 conference call, management mentioned that they see their pipelines as being big assets when it comes to thinking about the future of how hydrogen is going to move. Finally, the Canadian Government has incorporated a hydrogen strategy that intends to position Canada as a world-leading producer of clean hydrogen. This explains why Canadian midstream corporations are leading the hydrogen movement (e.g., Enbridge, TC Energy).  For American midstream operators, U.S. policy support has started to take shape the last few months, with both the Biden Administration and Congress proposing new and expanded hydrogen tax credits, along with other incentives for hydrogen investment. Along with the proposed policies, more supportive legislation could presumably accelerate the adoption of hydrogen and lead to further hydrogen-related developments across the midstream space.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2021/09/11/hydrogen-applications-in-midstream/,Hydrogen Applications In Midstream
"The pentagon in flames moments after a hijacked jetliner crashed into building at approximately 9:30 ... [+] a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. September 11, 2001, started as just another day in the Pentagon bureaucracy. And then suddenly it wasn’t. With 26,000 other people, I evacuated the building and flooded into one of the two massive parking lots. Like those 26,000 other people, I tried to make a phone call. Here’s my story of that day. That morning my staff and I were discussing some military acquisition program and its various problems. We sketched out costs and alternatives around my conference table in 2B256. At about 0900, our office manager came in to say that a plane had struck one of the twin towers in New York. Being in the national security business, we all knew about the incident in World War II when a U.S. B-25 bomber struck the Empire State building in bad weather. At about 0930, she came in and said that a plane had hit the other tower. We looked at each other and concluded that this was not a coincidence.  However, we were not as smart as we might have been. About 10 minutes later (at 0937 to be exact), we felt the building shudder. At first, we thought that a truck might have hit one of the supports under our office. It has happened before. However, looking out the window at an interior motorway, we saw black smoke billowing towards us and people running. At the same time, we could hear voices rising in the passageway outside. The voices weren’t panicked, but there were way too many for a normal day. And they were agitated. I told the staff to lock up their classified arterials and evacuate. At this point, Bill Gates and Windows 95 nearly got me killed.  Windows 95 took some time to shut down after you gave it the command. If you overrode the shutdown procedure, the computer would give you an error message the next time you logged on. Having been trained to avoid this error message. I waited for about 30 seconds for Windows 95 to shut down correctly. Then I pulled the classified package out of the computer and put it in the safe. If I had been thinking more clearly, I would have just pulled the classified package and suffered the error message later. There was no panic as people moved along the corridor and outside the building. In South parking, one of the Pentagon’s two massive parking lots, tens of thousands of people milled about. No one knew what happened. I tried to call my wife, but the phone system collapsed from so many people trying to call at a single location. Someone said that a plane had struck the building. I was thinking something small, a Cessna, and walked around to that side of the building to take a look. The exterior was smoking, and there was a large hole, but nothing of a plane visible. Shortly after, I heard an internal structural collapse. Then the police moved us along. Now Pentagon parking was declared a crime scene, and we were unable to get our cars out. Metro had shut down, so I walked up to a hill overlooking the Pentagon and watched it burn for the next three hours (and got thoroughly sunburned in the process). A journalist asked what I thought. My response was that Ho Chi Minh couldn’t kill me (I served a tour in Vietnam), Saddam Hussein couldn’t kill me (I had done a tour in Iraq), no terrorist was going to kill me. Eventually, the phone system came back up, and I was able to get a message to a friend who disseminated the good news to my family. I was okay. My wife was with a friend of the family, glued to the TV. Our two sons were in high school together and had gone to each other’s classroom to sit together until they heard about dad. In this, they were like many students in the area waiting to hear about a parent. Many friends and family checked in.  Not all families had such good news. The tragedy of the day was that no one knew who had been killed in the Pentagon. There was no master list until several days later. Many families in Washington sat at the dinner table on September 11, waiting for someone who never arrived. To the nation outside of New York and Washington, 9/11 was a major national event. In Washington, it was the local news. Our immediate office was lucky. One of our members had gone to a meeting in the Army spaces at the point of impact. Fortunately, he had stopped to talk to someone along the way and was not at the designated room when the plane hit. If he had been early for his meeting, he might have been the 185th name on the Pentagon Memorial. One of our colleagues in another office was not as lucky. By tragic coincidence, he was on the plane itself, headed for a conference on the West Coast. Rest in peace, Brian Jack. So, what would you do if faced with mass death and a world turned upside-down? You would do what I and all those people in South parking did on 9/11. You would reach out to someone to say that you loved them. It might be a spouse, a child, a parent, a lover, a friend. But in those moments of trauma, we would want that connection because, ultimately, those relationships define our lives.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcancian/2021/09/11/remembering-911-what-would-you-do-when-faced-with-mass-death/,Remembering 9/11: What Would You Do When Faced With Mass Death?
"BKwek Leng Beng, left, speaks as Sherman Kwek, looks on during a news conference in Singapore, on ... [+] August 11, 2017. City Developments—controlled by billionaire Kwek Leng Beng and his family—has decided to divest its equity stake in Sincere Property Group, avoiding what could be a “long drawn bankruptcy reorganization” for the cash-strapped Chinese subsidiary.  In an exchange filing late Friday, the Singapore-based property developer said it has agreed to sell the group’s 63.8% stake in HCP Chongqing Property Development, which holds 80% of Sincere, for $1.  “The consideration for the sale shares was agreed upon, taking into account the value of the sales shares, the current liquidity issues and potential bankruptcy reorganization of Sincere,” City Developments said in a statement. Concurrent with the divestment of its equity stake in Sincere, the company said it increased its effective stake in Shenzhen Tech Park to 65% by taking over Sincere’s interest in the industrial park. The consideration for the additional stake will be offset against City Developments’ remaining S$117 million debt exposure to Sincere.  “The board is of the view that the Sincere divestment and the Shenzhen agreement are in the best interest of the group as these allow the group to exit its investment in Sincere, and avoid being engaged in a possibly long drawn bankruptcy reorganization of Sincere,” City Developments said. Sincere’s financial troubles has been a drag for City Developments. The company wrote off S$1.78 billion ($1.3 billion) from its equity investment in Sincere last year, driving the group to report a net loss of S$1.9 billion for 2020, its worst-ever financial performance. In July, a creditor filed a bankruptcy claim against the Shanghai-based real estate developer at Chongqing No. 5 Intermediate People’s Court in China.  “We’re coming to the tail end of this negative news flow from Sincere,” said Vijay Natarajan, an analyst at RHB Singapore. “Bankruptcy can be quite a long drawn process in China and it’s going to draw away management’s time and focus. They realized that this battle is not worth fighting for.” Upon completion of the divestment, City Developments said all its nominee directors and officers will resign from Sincere. “Notwithstanding the group’s divestment of Sincere, the group will continue protect its rights as a creditor in relation to the repayment of the remaining outstanding loans which had been extended to Sincere,” it said. City Developments took a controlling interest in Sincere Property in April 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic started to wreak havoc on the global economy. The investment had sparked a disagreement between company chairman Kwek Leng Beng and his cousin, Kwek Leng Peck, who stepped down from the company’s board in October. In December, two independent directors—who also disagreed with the investment decision—resigned.  Kwek, 80, is also the chairman of Singapore’s Hong Leong Group, which was founded by his father in 1941. His cousin Quek Leng Chan, who is also a billionaire, runs a separate group in Malaysia, which also called Hong Leong. With a net worth of $8.5 billion, the Kweks were ranked No. 8 on the list of Singapore’s 50 richest that was published last month. His eldest son Sherman has been group CEO of City Developments since 2018.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanburgos/2021/09/11/singapore-kwek-leng-bengs-city-developments-exits-cash-strapped-chinese-subsidiary/,Singapore Kwek Leng Beng’s City Developments Exits Cash-Strapped Chinese Subsidiary
"The BMW i3 was one of the pioneering vehicles of electrification. Despite having been on the market since 2013, it still holds up surprisingly well thanks to regular battery capacity upgrades along the way. However, US production ended in July, the similarly groundbreaking i8 ceased production in April last year, and for a while it has looked like BMW had really dropped the ball on the EV revolution after an early lead. Recently, the company has refocused on EVs again. But its strategy is different to even the local German competition, let alone disruptors like Tesla, and considerably more hesitant. BMW's i Vision Circular represents the company's drive towards a 100% recycled lifecycle for its ... [+] cars. I talked to BMW Board Member for Purchasing and Supply, Dr Andreas Wendt, and the Vice President for Sustainability and Mobility, Dr Thomas Becker, about BMW’s plans for e-mobility and new energy vehicles over the coming decade. Although the company is clearly now putting a bigger focus on electrification again, this comes with some caveats, and it still feels like BMW is hedging its bets, unlike the bold EV strategy of the Volkswagen Group. Some of this is a little surprising, considering that the Tesla Model 3 was already outselling all of BMW’s models combined as far back as 2019. You would think BMW would need a strong electric competitor, and the i4 still hasn’t shipped yet. But it also signals where the company sits in the market. It’s much smaller than Volkswagen, for example, valued at under $70 billion compared to the latter’s $147 billion. It’s also more finely focused. One of the things that Dr Becker stressed to me was that just four European markets make up around 70% of BMW’s sales – Germany (obviously), the UK, France, and the Netherlands. So the US is part of the remaining 30% stretched globally. Dr Becker argues that the locations of its key markets have greatly influenced its choices, saying that the Mini will be 100% an EV by 2030, fitting the urban focus of these four countries. Unlike Volkswagen, however, BMW is also continuing to develop hydrogen-powered vehicles. According to Dr Becker, this is because South Korea is a more important market than (for example) Italy for BMW, and South Korea is investing heavily in hydrogen infrastructure. Dr Becker also doesn’t see that a 5-series car aimed at very long journeys is going to be 100% electric anytime soon, although the company has a titanic 1,000-hp electric M5 allegedly in the works. The front grille of a BMW i4 electric vehicle at the IAA Munich Motor Show in Munich, Germany, on ... [+] Monday, Sept. 6, 2021. The IAA, taking place in Munich for the first time, is the first in-person major European car show since the Coronavirus pandemic started. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg Dr Wendt also wanted to stress that BMW’s approach to sustainability wasn’t just focused on what comes out of the tailpipe, but the greenness of the whole production process. When EV is compared to EV, the tailpipe emissions will be zero in both cases, he argues, so it will be the entire system, from ore mine, to electricity supply mix, to the full vehicle lifecycle that counts. Dr Becker argues that this will be one of the ways its forthcoming i4 will differentiate itself, with a totally transparent lifecycle. It is also what the BMW i Vision Circular concept, unveiled at the IAA Mobility 2021 event in Munich recently, is all about. BMW vehicles already use 30% recycled and reused materials. The i Vision Circular aims to raise that figure to 100%, with a mantra of “RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE”. This focus on lifecycle more than purely vehicle technology helps explain BMW’s strategy with production. Where Volkswagen has transitioned whole facilities over to EVs, such as the Transparent Factory in Dresden, BMW will continue to make both internal combustion and electric vehicles on the same production lines. According to Dr Wendt, factories producing the 3-series and 4-series BMWs will also make the i4, and the iX will be made alongside the 5-series and 7-series. Dr Wendt doesn’t see this multi-skilling as being so difficult and allows the company to vary production balance to meet demand. What is clear is that BMW is still not expecting the EV revolution to happen overnight. Dr Wendt reckons that by 2030 only 50% of new cars will be fully electric, which means the other 50% won’t be. Some of that non-EV 50% will be important markets for BMW, which might even include the USA at its current slow rate of EV adoption compared to Europe and China, although Joe Biden’s green focus could change that. Dr Becker expects plug-in hybrids to continue to play a big role for many years to come as a result. In other words, while BMW is taking EVs seriously again, it doesn’t expect them to be the sole vehicle type anytime soon, if ever. Only time will tell if this is the right strategy for continuing success.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2021/09/11/bmw-still-hedging-bets-with-electric-cars-despite-renewed-focus/,"BMW Still Hedging Bets With Electric Cars, Despite Renewed Focus"
"DENVER, CO - OCTOBER 10: Jason Segall sample a brew at the 32nd annual Great American Beer Festival ... [+] at the Colorado Convention Center on October 10, 2013 in Denver, Colorado. The GABF runs October 10-12 and 49,000 attendees will be offered 3100 beers from 624 breweries. (Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images) The Great American Beer Festival might have not happened in person this year, but the beer festival’s beer competition, the largest commercial beer competition in the world, did go on. This year marked the largest competition to date, with medals awarded in 97 different beer categories covering 175 different beer styles. “Despite being forced to cancel the festival portion of GABF, our brewing community rallied together to make this year’s GABF competition one for the books—our largest competition judged to date,” said Chris Swersey, competition director, Great American Beer Festival. “Judges continue to be impressed with the quality and innovation of all entries they evaluated. The Brewers Association is proud to honor this year’s deserving winners. We look forward to celebrating in person together next year.” Judging for the event took place in 34 sessions over 17 days with strict health and safety measures in place.  All in all, 9680 beers were submitted this year from 2192 different breweries and all 50 states. Those beers were evaluated by 170 judges, and then medals were awarded to winners during the Craft Brewers Conference happening in Denver right now as well as via livestream on The Brewing Network.

"CHINA - CIRCA 2002: British ships destroying an enemy fleet in Canton, 1841. First Opium War, ... [+] China, 19th century. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) By the first quarter of the 19th century, a small corner of north-western Europe had conquered much of the rest of the world on the back of gunpowder, the sailing ship and an evangelizing view of the world which served both God and commerce. Two centuries later, we see a new force at work, aiming for the re-conquest of the world by the Western nations, this time with a powerful new entrant, the United States of America. The West’s weapons of war are as novel as is the ideology of conquest: gunpowder has been replaced by domination of powerful international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that include global finance as part of their arsenal, and an evangelizing ideology that views the trace gas CO2 as original sin. The aim of the West is of course not to directly rule the world for plunder or prestige, but to get the East to agree on foregoing the fruits of modern economic growth to “save the planet”.  Shapeshifting Environmentalism To be sure, none of this is very new. The early convocations of nations in the aftermath of World War II, perhaps best marked by the Stockholm conference on the environment in 1972, were devoted to  discussions of a new brotherhood of nations that would learn to live at peace not only with one another (the Cold War was still a dominating reality then) but also with “nature”. A new Rousseauesque angst had captured the minds of the ruling intellectual elites in the West, perhaps best personified by Joschka Fischer, a left-wing activist and part of the 1968 “beat generation” who later became Germany's first Green member of parliament in 1985. This angst needed to be shared with the world. It did not matter very much that some in the East like the indomitable Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India, proclaimed at the 1972 Stockholm conference that the environmental problem of the teeming multitudes of East was one of poverty not affluence.  It did not take long for this angst to shapeshift. The original fears of “running out” of natural resources —as the Club of Rome, an international elite of experts, had predicted — or of over-population as warned by serial predictors of global famines and cataclysm such as Paul Ehrlich are history. By the 1980s and 1990s it had become apparent that human ingenuity and the relentless march of technology had consigned the Malthusian thesis to the dust-heap of history. The world had continuously increasing reserves of minerals and fossil fuels despite galloping consumption. The US shale revolution found more oil and gas than the world could possibly absorb. The maverick one-term president Donald J. Trump proclaimed “energy dominance” for a country that conventional wisdom had expected to be an energy supplicant to Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil and gas producers of the world.  An Increasingly Prosperous World And far from fearing over-population, countries such as China are much more worried about the demography and geopolitics of “growing old before becoming rich”. Indeed, by late-20th century, demographers were already warning of all the problems associated with an impending decline of a youthful population that could sustain global living standards. While mystical believers of Gaia worried of the weight of a global population on “nature”, statistics of human welfare kept breaking historical records as never before. With respect to human welfare, virtually every metric or indicator shows significant if not dramatic improvement: life expectancy and income levels have improved; poverty levels have declined; people are living longer and healthier lives and the World Bank’s human development index has advanced virtually everywhere (ignoring the blip caused by the covid pandemic since 2020).  Since the 1920s, the global death rate from extreme weather events, for instance, has fallen by 98% despite the tripling of the world’s population. Average global life expectancy at birth in 1850 was just over 29 years; a century later it was over 45 years, and in 2019, it was almost 73 years. In 1820, almost 90% of the global population lived in absolute poverty. By 2015, this had dropped to less than 10% despite a sevenfold increase in world population. Carbon Imperialism To Save the World Yet, the up-coming UN conference on climate in Glasgow is all fire-and-brimstone. With the “climate emergency” upon us, Alok Sharma — president of the UN’s “COP26” summit to be held in Glasgow in November – warns us that this is the “last chance” to agree to a radical agenda of “decarbonization” failing which the world inevitably consigns itself to climate catastrophe. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres warns us that it is nothing less than ""a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable"". Never mind that this is all based on dubious “hockey-stick” global warming models concocted in the West. And here is where the West’s ambit at a moral carbon imperialism is upon us in the East:  Be prepared to give up cheap and affordable fossil fuels that help your people achieve higher standards of living or else the planet, with all of us in it, gets it. Yes, we promise you money (we know, the last promise was $100 billion per annum, though not yet attained). But there is more, we promise you. We all understand you cannot possibly expect European standards of living but new energy technologies are around the corner, trust us. With solar and wind power, and electric vehicles, and hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, we will get there. But stop new coal power plants right now and oil and gas too. We are all in this together.  ""History never repeats itself but it rhymes,"" said Mark Twain. Now however there is nothing short of massive discordance. China, the world’s largest carbon sinner by far, has “promised” net zero by 2060. Sinner or not, it has quite clearly stated that it might consider participating in the western notion of buying Gaia’s indulgences with decarbonization, perhaps, some decades into the future, but only if the US plays ball: give up the endless tirades about Uigher oppression, consider Taiwan as part of China and stop being an aggressive competitor to the Middle Kingdom’s natural quest for Asian dominance. India, on its part, is also quite clear: “we urge G20 countries to commit to bring down per capita emissions to the global average by 2030”. In other words, you come down to not quite our levels of poverty, and give us space to become not quite as rich as you. And then we have the outliers: Australia has said quite clearly “no” to Biden, Boris and the UN in their requests that coal extraction, coal power and coal exports should stop.  The days of China being “carved up like a ripe melon” by the western powers or of the dissipated Mughals in India being easily replaced by the East India Company as overlords of the subcontinent are long gone. Australia, the ex-colony of convicts, is no pushover either. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of COP26, while not entertaining imperial notions of conquest and rule, wants his environmental place in the sun. But he is bound to be disappointed. Carbon imperialism will not work.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tilakdoshi/2021/09/11/cop26-and-carbon-imperialism-a-showdown-looming/,COP26 And Carbon Imperialism: A Showdown Looming
"On Friday, the House Committee on Transportation put bold steps in their proposed piece of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. As a procedural matter, the House Committee’s move reflects a step toward the traditional role of the standing committees. Conversely, the committee’s action distances itself from the bipartisan Senate group that wrote the infrastructure bill. The Senate group effort assembled ten Senators of centrist views, without any regard for the traditional role of the Senate transportation committee. The House action was quite the opposite The chair of the House Transportation and infrastructure, Peter DeFazio (D. Ore.) famously said last month about the Senate group-of-ten bill that “I didn’t sign that agreement . . . . We are working with the White House to see if there are ways around it.” Technically, the House Committee proposal is at this point just the starting point of a committee mark-up this coming Tuesday. But, it has the wind in its sails.  Concretely, one of the major actions of the House Committee demonstrating their approach was to fund climate-related provisions throughout their proposal. The bill would provide $1 billion to support projects that develop low-emission technologies or sustainable fuels. Not coincidentally, the House committee proposal comes right after the White House expressed Thursday its goal to reduce aviation emissions 20% by 2030. And, the House Committee bill includes $2.5 billion for port-related projects. This would include lowering ports’ impact on the environment. There is a great deal of support for transit improvements, both to help passengers and to promote a low-carbon mode of travel. The House Committee bill has $10 billion for a program to support transit, and $10 billion for high speed rail. A version of the House Committee stance now, derives from a House-passed (in June) $760 billion transportation and water infrastructure bill. This evoked high intensity of polarization. The bill passed 221-201, with two Republicans joining Democrats in support. Leading House Republicans voice vociferous opposition. “At every turn the majority has ensured that infrastructure programs become climate change programs,” Rep. Tome Cole (R-Okla.) said. ”New environmental mandates . . . will snarl construction projects. Provisions that prioritize mass transit over roads will force rural districts like my own to spend funding in ineffective ways rather than on the road improvements we so desperately need.” At that time (House passage in June of the $760 billion bill), Rep. DeFazio said “I heard from my republican colleague . . . ‘climate change provisions don’t belong in a transportation bill’” DeFazio went on “Seriously? The largest source of fossil fuel pollution in the United States is transportation.”  In their passage processes, the Senate group-of-ten-centrists bill, and the current House Committee bill, represent polar opposites in terms of Congressional procedure. The Senate group successfully reached an impressive goal of bipartisan action. That Senate group got things done by breaking away from the traditional Congressional committee approach. On the other hand, the House Committee is shooting for a much bigger, bolder goal. It aims to accomplish great climate control deeds.  The Senate approach has a better chance of becoming law. But the House Committee approach will take on the awful challenge of climate change. One has to hope that in some form, the House Committee approach will cross the finish line.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2021/09/10/a-house-committee-put-some-major-transportation-proposals-into-a-draft-reconciliation-bill/,A House Committee Put Some Major Transportation Proposals Into A Draft Reconciliation Bill
"Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, reacts after winning the third set against Alexander Zverev, of Germany, ... [+] during the semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Twenty-seven matches down, one to go.  That is where world No. 1 Novak Djokovic stands in his pursuit of the calendar Grand Slam.  With his 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 victory over No. 4 Sascha Zverev in the semifinals of the U.S. Open Friday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Djokovic advanced to the U.S. Open final against No. 2 Daniil Medvedev on Sunday and has a chance to own all four majors in 2021.  After capturing the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, the 34-year-old Serb can join Rod Laver as the only men in the Open Era to win the Grand Slam, and become the sixth person ever to do it. Laver won two Grand Slams in 1962 and ‘69. The 83-year-old Australian legend, nicknamed “The Rocket,” sat courtside for both men’s semifinals Friday and the crowd cheered as Elton John’s “Rocket Man” blared over the sound system when he was shown on the large screens. He has said he would be “very happy” to welcome Djokovic to the Grand Slam club. CORRECTS SPELLING TO ROD, INSTEAD OF RON - Former pro tennis player Rod Laver, right, waves to fans ... [+] during the semifinals of the U.S. Open tennis tournament between Felix Auger-Aliassime, of Canada, and Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Djokovic is into his 31st major final and is seeking to set a men’s record with 21 major titles, which would surpass his rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. He is bidding for his fourth U.S. Open title (2011, ‘15, ‘18) in his ninth finals appearance. “I’m going for a fourth U.S. Open, that’s all I’m thinking about it,” he told Patrick McEnroe on court.  Pressed on his quest for the Grand Slam, Djokovic added: “It’s there, it’s there. I know that people would like to hear me talk about it but there’s not much to talk about. There’s only one match, let’s do it. All in. I’m going to put my heart and my soul and my body and head into that one. I’m going to treat the next match like it is the last match of my career.” The loss snapped a 16-match winning streak for Zverev, who beat Djokovic en route to the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Zverev fell to 0-11 against Top-10 opponents in majors. He lost in five sets in last year’s final to Dominic Thiem after coming within two points of winning the title. Alexander Zverev, of Germany, reacts after losing a point to Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, during the ... [+] semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) This was the fourth time that Djokovic had been pushed to a fifth set during his Grand Slam run. In the championship match in Paris, he came from two sets down to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas for the title. In the second game of the decisive fifth set against Zverev, Djokovic ended a long baseline rally with a drop shot and a forehand pass after Zverev was forced to come in. That put the Serb up 2-0. Serving at 0-3, 30-40, Zverev shanked an easy overhead long and Djokovic was up a double-break 4-0. Djokovic missed a chance to close the match out while serving at 5-1, but then earned a match point with the German serving at 2-5. Djokovic closed it out with a forehand winner and the two men soon embraced at the net. As he has done in his previous three matches, Djokovic dropped the first set to an aggressive Zverev, who took advantage of his one break to take the lead. And just as he had done in previous matches, Djokovic reestablished control after that, winning the next two sets.  The third set featured a 53-shot rally that last 1 minute, 18 seconds — and was ultimately won by Djokovic. The crowd erupted during the point and finally exhaled in celebration when it was over.  “It’s kind of a hurricane, a tornado of emotions, that you’re going through in the sequence of one point,” Djokovic said “There’s no escape, you gotta find a way. Over the years, I’ve managed to find a formula that works for me…There’s no secret potion that I would say is the secret of success.  “Tennis a beautiful sport and you’ve got to have mind and body balanced at all times if you want to compete on the biggest stage for the trophies.” But Zverev did not quit and earned an early break in the court set, going up 3-1. He served for the fourth set at 5-4 and closed it out with a forehand winner. The crowd appeared split, periodically rooting for each man. Djokovic has had the crowd against him for years while facing Nadal and Federer here — and even at times without them here during this fortnight.  Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, returns a shot to Felix Auger-Aliassime, of Canada, during the ... [+] semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Now Djokovic will face Medvedev in the final and the crowd figures to be divided agin.  The Russian is into his second U.S. Open final in three years after taking out No. 12 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada in straight sets.  It will be a rematch of the Australian Open final won by Djokovic in straight sets in February, but Medvedev says he didn’t play his best in Melbourne. “If it's going to be him, it's going to be more interesting in terms of tactic what I'm going to prepare,” he said. “I think the thing that I understand, I always give my best, but I feel like I didn't leave my heart on the court in Melbourne. Even if of course I wanted to, there was something not turning up this match. “That's what I'm going to try to do on Arthur Ashe with hopefully 100% of fans. No matter the score, I'm just going to turn up the heat, if I can say, and try to do my best, even more than what I did in Melbourne.” Medvedev said before the tournament that he was here to stop Djokovic from winning the Grand Slam. Now he is in position to and he knows he can halt Djokovic’s bid for history while simultaneously winning his first Slam. “I'm probably be in the history books a little bit somewhere like not letting him do this,” he said. “But I don't really care about it. I think it's more about him, that it affects him.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/10/27-down-1-to-go-novak-djokovic-moves-into-us-open-final-one-victory-from-the-grand-slam/,"27 Down, 1 To Go: Novak Djokovic Moves Into U.S. Open Final, One Victory From The Grand Slam"
"Malignant In horror circles, James Wan is a modern legend—and for good reason. If nothing else, creating the Saw franchise and helming both Insidious and The Conjuring certainly brings an air of well deserved respect with it. His new film Malignant is a film of an entirely different kind. Horror, yes, but it’s one of the most unique horror experiences you’ll have for some time. The film follows Madison Lake-Mitchell (Annabelle Wallis), a woman who from the outset is in a clearly bad relationship and has herself had a long stroke of bad luck—she’s suffered multiple miscarriages. One night after a particularly harrowing fight with her husband, strange phenomena start to occur and (long story short) her husband ends up mysteriously dead. Madison knows the killer—Gabriel, who she long ago had experiences with and has long since forgotten. The resulting police investigation reveals shocking truths about her past, Gabriel, and Madison that I will absolutely not spoil—you have to see it for yourself. Without spoiling it, however, I can say the film’s conclusion will be divisive—it’s a massive, swing-for-the-fences big-idea ending (and one you’ll either love or loathe). It harkens back to the days when major horror franchises were launched with out-there ideas like “what if everyone’s being hunted by a doll with a serial killer’s soul in it?” or “what if a burned-alive predator can kill you in your dreams?” Whatever your takeaway, it’s refreshing to see someone like James Wan putting films out there with novel ideas. Annabelle Wallis brings exactly the range needed to land her role as Madison, from grounded and realistic to high camp when needed. The film’s VFX transitions (highlighted in the trailer) were another novel high point, and the stunt work and action choreography in the final act of the film that was stunningly executed—seriously some of the best this year. At the same time, perhaps the entire first half really struggles with widely inconsistent performances, some oddly paced edits, and corresponding issues with tone. The campiness of it’s cold open, for example, sits poorly against the abusive argument we see in the following scenes, and a lot of the performers are oddly flat or muted compared to what the scene seems to call for. Frankly the inconsistencies are odd and a tad inexplicable for a director as talented and seasoned as Wan. Altogether, Malignant is messy but imaginative. There are serious inconsistencies across the board, and when you find out what the end is you’ll surely either love it or absolutely hate it—it’s wild bonkers madness. Despite its flaws, however, there are some major technical accomplishments, the third act is at the very least a tremendously entertaining cinematic endeavor, and it’s great that Wan is taking risks in new horror endeavors instead of playing it safe—this movie is anything but safe. Check it out with as open a mind as you can. Malignant is available in theaters and on HBO Max.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffewing/2021/09/10/review-malignant-is-a-wildly-inconsistent-but-gloriously-bonkers-ride-into-the-unexpected/,Review: ‘Malignant’ Is A Wildly Inconsistent But Gloriously Bonkers Ride Into The Unexpected
" Just hours after a Florida appeals court reinstated Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates in local school districts Friday, the U.S. Department of Education announced a civil rights investigation into the policy, which it warned could harm students with disabilities.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis takes his mask off as he prepares to speak during a press conference at ... [+] the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 6, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. In a Friday letter to state Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, DOE’s Office for Civil Rights said Florida’s policy — which requires school districts to let parents opt their children out of mask-wearing rules — may run afoul of federal non-discrimination laws by making it harder for schools to protect students who face an elevated risk of Covid-19. DOE said it hasn’t necessarily concluded Florida’s policy is unlawful yet, and promised to act as a “neutral factfinder” during its probe. The investigation was disclosed several hours after Florida’s 1st District Court of Appeal halted a lower court ruling that blocked the mask mandate ban. The federal government opened similar investigations last month into five other states that ban or sharply restrict local mask mandates, and warned it could add Florida to the list if a court order striking down the state’s policy is reversed. DeSantis’ press secretary Christina Pushaw responded to the federal government’s investigation by tweeting: “Bring it.” Forbes has reached out to DeSantis’ office and the Florida Department of Education for comment. In its letter to Florida, DOE said it could resolve the civil rights investigation by negotiating a voluntary agreement with the state. The agency also has the power to revoke federal funding from entities deemed to have violated federal law, but Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona told NBC’s Meet The Press last month that approach “doesn’t usually work” and “adds insult to injury to these students who are trying to get into the classroom.” Florida banned local mask mandates over the summer, joining several other Republican-controlled states with restrictions on mask-wearing rules. DeSantis cast the move as a way of giving parents discretion over their children’s health needs, but the policy — which comes as Florida struggles with a high Covid-19 infection rate — earned rebukes from critics who say it prevents schools from protecting students and clashes with the CDC’s recommendations. The policy has been mired in legal challenges for weeks: A local judge halted the mask mandate ban in late August after a group of parents sued, his decision was automatically stayed after the state appealed the ruling, the judge vacated that stay and once again blocked the policy on Wednesday, and a state appeals court reinstated the stay on Friday. Meanwhile, several local school districts — including in large cities like Miami and Orlando — have imposed mask mandates despite Florida’s ban, prompting the state to threaten to withhold funding for school board members’ salaries. The Biden administration has faced off against DeSantis on Covid-19 in the past. When Florida vowed to yank funding from districts that defy the mask mandate ban, DOE said local districts can fill in the gap with their share of federal Covid-19 relief funds, and the White House said Thursday it will make additional funds available to targeted school districts.

The animated musical Encanto, which Disney will release November 24, will have a 30-day theatrical run, before heading to streaming. The announcement comes after Shang-Chi, Marvel’s first movie to be released exclusively in theaters this year, ended its first week at the domestic box office with $110 million. Free Guy, which had a 45-day theatrical run before being released for streaming, is also doing well globally, nabbing over $66 million in China. The encouraging numbers have prompted movie studio Sony to move up the release of its Venom sequel from October 15 to October 1. Movie theaters have reported seeing a boost in moviegoers from Shang-Chi, with weekend box office attendance beating out 2019 numbers for the first time. However, concerns remain over the spread of the highly contagious delta variant, which has fueled a surge in Covid-19 cases across the nation. Paramount pulled Clifford The Big Red Dog from its 2021 schedule and delayed Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 to 2022. Sony also moved its animated film Hotel Transylvania: Transformania, from an October 1 theater release to a streaming-only release on Amazon Prime. A big slice of the  franchise’s target audience is children under the age of 12, who are still not eligible to get vaccinated against coronavirus, which would have likely cut box-office receipts.  Disney’s announcement will also bring some hope to audiences that one of this year’s most anticipated films, Spider-Man: No Way Home, a collaboration between Disney and Sony Pictures set to release on December 17, won’t be delayed. Last week the teaser trailer for the film broke the record for most global views within 24 hours, with many excited over the prospect of seeing former “Spider-men” Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, as well as their villains, return.

(Photo by Roger Kisby/Getty Images for YouTube) South Korean girl group Blackpink isn’t busy promoting anything at the moment, as member Lisa has just launched her solo career (without leaving the band) with her debut single on her own, “Lalisa.” While the quartet might not be in full promo mode, that doesn’t mean their fans all around the world aren’t still engaging with them and consuming everything connected to the superstars, and now they’ve reached an incredible milestone on one of the most important platforms for musicians. Blackpink has just passed Justin Bieber for the most subscribers on YouTube, moving up one spot on the all-time ranking of the most popular channels on the video hosting site. The K-pop icons now claim 65.6 million subscribers, beating the Canadian pop singer by half a million users, at least for the time being.  Bieber held as the most popular act on YouTube, at least in terms of number of subscribers, for a long time, keeping names like Blackpink, BTS (No. 3, 57.5 million), Marshmello (No. 4, 53.8 million) and Ariana Grande (No. 5, 49.6 million) at bay. Blackpink’s surging success may be due to the release of Lisa’s semi-self-titled “Lalisa,” which stands as one of the most highly-anticipated songs in K-pop history. Several teasers of her first solo track and another tune by the rapper and singer were shared on the band’s page, as was the single’s official video, which has thus far racked up 63 million views in just its first 19 hours of availability. All that attention likely helped the group increase their subscriber count, final passing Bieber after sitting right behind him. Launched in June 2016, Blackpink’s YouTube page has been going strong ever since it went online. Hundreds of clips, from proper music videos to audio-only uploads to behind-the-scenes content and so much more has been shared with the world on the channel, and the many, many visuals have now racked up more than 19 billion views.  At the rate all of Blackpink’s videos are being watched by millions of Blinks (the name given to the group’s fan base), the page will surely hit 20 billion plays in short order, perhaps by the end of the year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/10/blackpink-passes-justin-bieber-as-the-most-subscribed-youtube-channel-in-history/,Blackpink Passes Justin Bieber As The Most-Subscribed YouTube Channel In History
" Some 26 million Americans tuned into the NFL’s regular-season kickoff between the Dallas Cowboys and the defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday, up 20% from last year, according to NBC, as football continues to bring reliably large audiences to TV despite a drop in viewership last year.  Tom Brady hands off the ball to Ronald Jones II of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the first quarter ... [+] against the Dallas Cowboys at Raymond James Stadium on September 9, 2021 in Tampa. The game, in which the Bucs squeaked by the Cowboys 31-29, averaged roughly 24.4 million viewers on NBC’s broadcast network and 1.6 million on Peacock and other online streaming services, according to preliminary Nielsen and digital figures provided by NBC. The network says Thursday’s game was the highest-rated NFL regular-season kickoff since 2015, which drew an average of 27.4 million viewers. Viewership increased roughly 20% from last year’s kickoff game, when 21.6 million people watched the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans ring in an NFL season dogged by Covid-related postponements, according to NBC. The game was more widely viewed in the Dallas area than in any other large television market. It earned a 29.1 rating in Dallas, which reflects the percentage of the area’s TV-owning households tuning in on average. Tampa was the game’s third-largest market (24.6), ranked after San Antonio, and Providence and Boston were the fourth- and sixth-largest markets, likely due to Bucs quarterback Tom Brady’s two-decade stint with the New England Patriots. Television ratings have sagged over the last year-and-a-half amid Covid-19 disruptions and stiff competition from streaming services. The MLB World Series earned record-low ratings last fall, this year’s Academy Awards were the least-watched in history, the 2020 and 2021 NBA Finals drew smaller audiences than in pre-pandemic years and the Olympic Opening Ceremony lost nearly 10 million viewers from 2016 to 2021. The NFL also suffered a drop in ratings last season, with regular-season viewership down 7% and Super Bowl ratings sinking to their lowest levels since 2007, but football games still tend to earn significantly larger ratings than anything else on television. As a result, live football is increasingly valuable for U.S. broadcasters: Earlier this year, the nation’s four largest TV networks and Amazon reportedly agreed to pay the NFL more than $100 billion over 11 years to broadcast games. The Cowboys are worth $6.5 billion, making it the league’s most valuable franchise, by Forbes’ estimates. The Bucs rank 21st out of 32 NFL teams ($2.94 billion), but the franchise’s value grew 29% in one year, faster than any other team in the league, with merchandise and ticket sales soaring since Brady’s 2020 arrival and 2021 Super Bowl win.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/10/nfl-kickoff-game-scores-largest-audience-in-six-years-nbc-says/,"NFL Kickoff Game Scores Largest Audience In Six Years, NBC Says"
"Loren Steffy, UH Energy Scholar LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - OCTOBER 12: Gas flame on cooker hob, England, United Kingdom. (Photo by ... [+] Tim Graham/Getty Images)  My gas water heater recently started leaking, and I replaced it with an electric one. It wasn’t an obvious choice. On the one hand, the price of propane, which powers most of my home appliances, has surged 42 percent since last October. On the other hand, I was among the more than 4 million Texans who lost power during record freezing temperatures in February. The state’s stubborn and willful embrace of an unreliable electric system means that during the next winter freeze or other grid-rattling weather event, I may lose hot water.  My choice is playing out, albeit under different circumstances, in other parts of the country. Homeowners and local government officials are reassessing the use of natural gas appliances, and in places far removed from Texas — places like the northeast where they prefer to leave the production of fossil fuels to others — municipalities are actively encouraging the switch to all-electric homes.  Communities around Boston, for example, are debating whether to block or limit the use of natural gas for cooking and heating in new houses. Similar efforts to phase out natural gas are underway in San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and New York. The first phase-out ordinance was passed by city leaders in Berkeley, Calif., in 2019. The measures, these city leaders believe, will reduce demand for fossil fuel and help meet climate change goals.  Of course, oil-producing states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana have adopted laws prohibiting gas phase-out measures.  All of this law-making and goal-setting misses the point. No matter what goals or limits we set, energy transition is driven by economics — we need abundant and reliable supplies that can be produced affordably. Banning the use of natural gas is just as bad as banning a ban on its use. Both policies ignore the underlying economics of energy transition.  During the past 15 years, we’ve made steady progress toward cleaner fuels, but we haven’t done it by legislating demand. We’ve done it by innovation that has improved the economics of alternatives. Hydraulic fracturing, for all its negative consequences, has allowed the U.S. to shift more power production away from coal — a far greater environmental scourge.  In 2005, the U.S. generated half its electricity with coal. By 2019, that share had been cut in half. Natural gas, meanwhile, rose from 19 percent to 38 percent of all generation. The reason: fracking made gas cheap and abundant.  Those trends, by the way, may reverse in the short-term as skyrocketing demand for post-pandemic electricity collide with lower natural gas production, which is driving up gas prices. In July, average spot prices for gas were more than double a year earlier, and 62 percent above 2019.  The rise of electric vehicles and other alternative transportation fuels — natural gas among them — likely represents the next big shift. And that shift can’t occur without natural gas. If we’re using electricity for transportation, that means we need more natural gas, not less, in the short-term, to generate that additional electricity.  “I think we could migrate away from crude oil, but I’m not sure it makes sense to migrate away from all fossil fuel,” said Christine Ehlig-Economides, a University of Houston petroleum engineering professor.  The phase-out argument seems to say that by switching away from gas appliances, demand for natural gas — and, of course, that great green bogeyman, fracking — will diminish. But that, if you’ll pardon the pun, is a pipe dream. Renewables simply can’t meet the demand. They account for only 20 percent of U.S. generation, and it’s intermittent and weather-dependent. Even the Biden administration’s overly optimistic plan, released in early September, to decarbonize the grid by 2050 will be possible only with hefty federal investment of about $210 billion.  But even so, achieving that will take another three decades. At the moment, renewables have neither the capacity nor the consistency to meet, on their own, the rising demand for electricity. What’s more, most large-scale wind and solar farms are built in remote areas, and we lack adequate transmission capacity to get that power to cities.  Combined-cycle natural gas plants are the best option we have for supporting renewables. The more renewables we build, the more we need natural gas plants to support them.  This is particularly true in Texas, where we became the biggest wind power producer in North America with the help of abundant — and cheap — natural gas supplies.  The drive to phase out natural gas is premature — a case of climate change fears getting ahead of rational policy. Cooking with electricity instead of gas isn’t going to save the planet. In fact, homes and businesses account for just 13 percent of the greenhouse gases the U.S. produces annually, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The move to cleaner fuels needs to focus on the dirtiest fuels first — coal, then oil, then natural gas. The chemicals industry, for example, is shifting away from oil and turning natural gas as feedstock for plastics, pesticides, paints and other household items. Chemical companies use of petroleum accounts for more than 14 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions.  At the same time, natural gas producers need to understand that providing the foundation for our energy future comes with a responsibility to the public that the industry has largely ignored.  In the wake of the February freeze in Texas, which left some 200 people dead and cost billions of dollars in property damage the natural gas industry has taken little responsibility.  In fact, some players made billions and turned around and funneled that money to state politicians in for the form campaign contributions. State leaders can try to legislate against gas phase outs, but the industry now faces a consequence of its own inaction: consumers throughout the Midwest face higher gas bills. In Texas, consumers are facing billions in charges that could add to their bills over the next 30 years.  That could undermine public trust in natural gas as a heating fuel and cause more homebuyers to demand electric appliances.  The past 15 years has taught us that we can combat climate change and embrace energy choices that are cleaner and more affordable. Rather than mandating phase outs or banning them, elected officials need to focus on encouraging the most reliable and affordable options, then let consumers choose.  In my case, I chose to phase out my gas water heater because of rising propane costs, but I still want the option of having gas appliances. If the February freeze taught us anything, it’s that we don’t have reliable energy infrastructure in Texas. So I’m hedging my bets: the new water heater is electric, an older one is gas.  The reason is simple: reliability matters too. We won’t be ready to phase out gas until we have an electric grid that can support growing demand for electricity. Even by the most optimistic assessments, that will take decades.    Loren Steffy is a writer-at-large for Texas Monthly, an executive producer for Rational Middle Media and a managing director for 30 Point Strategies, where he heads the 30 Point Press publishing imprint.

" The Biden administration filed an appeal on Friday of a district court ruling that found the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to be illegal, putting thousands of people who entered the U.S. as children at risk of deportation.   Immigration rights activists take part in a rally in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC ... [+] on November 12, 2019. - The US Supreme Court hears arguments on November 12, 2019 on the fate of the ""Dreamers,"" an estimated 700,000 people brought to the country illegally as children but allowed to stay and work under a program created by former president Barack Obama.Known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, the program came under attack from President Donald Trump who wants it terminated, and expired last year after the Congress failed to come up with a replacement. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) The appeal was filed by the U.S. Justice Department in response to Houston federal court Judge Andrew Hanen’s ruling in July that DACA was illegal and barred the Department of Homeland Security from approving any new applications. The case will be heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a conservative reputation, having upheld a previous decision from Hanen in 2015 blocking Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens. While the ruling is appealed, the over 600,000 people actively enrolled in DACA will not lose their ability to work or protection from deportation. the decision “relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an uncertain future.” DACA was set up in 2012 by former President Barack Obama through an executive order and offers protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children. Since the program wasn’t authorized by Congress, Hanen argued in his ruling that it was unlawful. Biden has since renewed calls for Congress to provide a path to citizenship for DACA enrollees. The program has weathered legal challenges in the past, notably from former President Donald Trump’s administration, whose attempt to end the program was blocked by the Supreme Court.

"Schools are designed to be a safe places where children can learn about the world and gain skills that will shape their future. However, today, across the world, schools have become targets. Indeed, as reported by the U.N., “more than 75 million 3-to-18-year-olds liv[e] in 35 crisis-affected countries” where their access to education will be affected and they require urgent need of educational support.  Children look on in a classroom with abandoned Tigrayan forces uniforms at an elementary school in ... [+] the village of Bisober in Ethiopia's Tigray region, on December 9, 2020. (Photo credit: EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP via Getty Images) The Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attacks reports that over the past five years, over 22,000 students, teachers, and academics have been injured or killed in attacks at educational institutions during armed conflict or in areas experiencing political instability. According to them:  “Between 2015 and 2019, 93 countries experienced at least one reported attack on education. Students and educators were most frequently harmed by direct attacks in Afghanistan, Cameroon, and Palestine.  Armed forces, other state actors, and armed groups used schools and universities for military purposes in 34 countries between 2015 and 2019, including as bases, detention centers, and weapons stores. In the past five years, state armed forces or armed groups reportedly recruited students from schools in 17 countries.” While Afghanistan has been a hot spot for such attacks, especially now that the Taliban have seized power, and with the growing presence of ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) in the country, the situation will only get worse. In May 2021, explosions outside a school in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 85 people and wounded over 140. The majority of the victims were girls attending the Syed Al-Shahda school (for girls only) in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood of Kabul. Although responsibility for the attack is not clear, the attack was similar in nature to attacks by the Taliban and ISIS-K in the past. With the Taliban in power, who object to mixed education and education of girls more broadly, there is an ongoing threat to education itself.  In Nigeria, Boko Haram has been targeting schools for years because of the belief that schools teach Western values. Boko Haram conducts attacks in predominately Muslim states and the majority of abducted girls are Muslim. Yet, Christian girls have also been targeted by Boko Haram. Christian girls abducted by Boko Haram are forced to convert to Islam (and/or marry their abductors). Among them is Leah Sharibu, a Christian girl who remains in captivity as she refused to convert. Furthermore, Nigeria has seen a wave of copycat attacks. In the latest attack, in September 2021, gunmen abducted 73 students in northwestern Nigeria. In the last ten months, more than 1,000 students have been kidnapped from schools in northern Nigeria. While the majority of students have been released, some have been killed in captivity and over 200 remained hostages. Similarly, attacks of Fulani militia in the Middle Belt disrupt access to education of children in that region.  As between 2015 and 2019, 93 countries experienced at least one reported attack on education, the list of similar attacks only goes on.  On September 9, the world observes the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, a day established by the U.N. General Assembly to raise awareness of the plight of millions of children living in countries affected by conflict. The day should be used to affirm the importance of safeguarding schools as places of protection and safety for students and educators and working to make it happen. As attacks on education continue, steps have to be taken to make school safe, especially in regions with a legacy of such attacks. No child should fear for their lives at school. No child should have to choose between education and staying safe. Children should not be used and abused for the agendas and ideologies of terror organizations or groups.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2021/09/10/when-schools-are-not-safe-places-education-under-attack-globally/,When Schools Are Not Safe Places: Education Under Attack Globally
"Policemen and firemen run away from the huge dust cloud caused as the World Trade Center's Tower One ... [+] collapses on September 11, 2001, in New York City. For MSNBC anchor Alex Witt, it was a day that started off like any other day. The weather was perfect, and the morning of September 11, 2001, treated commuters like Witt to a clear blue sky. She was driving into work — to the newsroom in Seacaucus, New Jersey, that MSNBC operated at the time — and listening to the radio when she saw it. The smoke, billowing from that terrible gash in the side of the World Trade Center’s North Tower. And if she didn't realize right away the full extent of the catastrophe that was unfolding in Lower Manhattan, watching the second plane crash into the World Trade Center moments after she got into the newsroom brought everything into stark, horrific relief. Witt would end up reporting all night from Ground Zero, finally driving home on the morning of the 12th. The George Washington Bridge, her usual conduit between New York and New Jersey, was closed. She drove up the Palisades Parkway to get to the Tappan Zee Bridge so she could cross back into Westchester County. At one point, she called her parents in Los Angles, but couldn’t stop crying. In her rear-view mirror, Manhattan was still bathed in an other-worldly fog of smoke and ash. In between her sobs, to her parents on the other end, she remembers being overcome with grief. “My God, all those people ...” Which, when you think about it, is still more or less the immediate visceral reaction that most of us still have when we remember 9/11. The remembrances and commemorations are pouring in ahead of this weekend marking the 20th anniversary of the attacks, which ultimately killed around 3,000 Americans. President Biden on Saturday is visiting all three sites that were attacked on 9/11 — including New York City, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Various broadcasters and streaming platforms, meanwhile, have also lined up some deeply moving look-backs at the day. Some, like Netflix’s five-episode limited series Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror, rely on never-before-seen footage and audio. And, of course, haunting interviews with the people who were there. For Witt, who shared with me some of what she experienced as a reporter on 9/11, the day changed, for her, everything from the way she approaches her profession to how she would live life thereafter. And, fittingly, she will anchor special coverage to mark 20 years since the 9/11 attacks starting Saturday at 5 a.m. ET on MSNBC. Alex Witt, reporting from Ground Zero on September 11, 2001. My day started on my way to work in Secaucus, where MSNBC was based in 2001. I was driving into work, listening to the radio as usual, and saw the smoke coming from the first impact just as it was first being reported. I knew it was going to be the lead story on the broadcasts, though at the time it was initially believed to be some sort of commuter plane that had hit the (World Trade Center). Moments after I got into the newsroom, the second plane hit and that’s when the significance of the story multiplied exponentially. I was an anchor and reporter at the time, though my anchoring was mostly on overnight shifts, and my reporting was on stories that often hit with updates multiple times throughout the day.  Soon after I got into work, I climbed up the service stairs to the roof of the building where we had a direct view across the Hudson River to the World Trade Center. There was a cameraman already set up, and a field producer, and we watched from there as the towers collapsed. I remember feeling sick to my stomach and utterly horrified as I watched knowing people trapped in the building were losing their lives in that moment. We stayed there for a while after the towers collapsed showing the huge cloud of debris engulfing lower Manhattan. I stayed at MSNBC all day, and I finally went to get some sleep at the nearby Crown Plaza hotel around 10 p.m. But not 15 minutes after crawling into bed exhausted, I got a call from the NBC News network desk. My colleague Robert Dembo was in charge of domestic operations, and he told me to get back into work. I was to be on the first Path Train when it opened back up at midnight from Secaucus to Herald Square in Manhattan. From there I had to get myself down to Ground Zero. And I was on that train with only two other people including a colleague and a man who looked as shocked as we were heading into the unknown in Manhattan. It was really, really eerie. Smoke pours from the World Trade Center after it was hit by two hijacjked passenger planes on ... [+] September 11, 2001 in New York City. I tried to focus on being as professional as I could be, knowing that people around the world were tuning in to get information. There are two specific memories I recall from that first dark overnight from the 11th into the 12th that will never leave me. I cry even today when I think about them.  One was talking with four NYFD firefighters as they were coming off an exhausting shift digging in “The Pile.” I always say we ‘grow them bigger here in NYC.’ Our firefighters have a Herculean feel to them. But these four towering men had eyes that were haunted by what they had seen. I walked alongside them without my cameraman as it seemed like the right thing to not shove a camera in their faces. I asked if they could tell me anything I could report to our viewers. They stayed silent. Then I asked them if they had any hope of pulling any of their colleagues out from the debris. One firefighter stopped and looked at me and said, “Lady, all we’ve got is hope.” I asked if there was anything I could do for them. The firefighter looked so vulnerable, like he had been to hell and back, and said, “I could use a hug.” So hug all four of them I did. All of us needed to be reminded we were alive, despite the destruction and despair around us, and show in that moment that we were in this together. We never said another word. I left them there as they walked in silence to their shuttle back to the fire house somewhere up the road.  My other profound memory is seeing dozens of doctors, nurses, and medical personnel wearing their scrubs or white coats and their protective eye shields. They were lined up near the West Side Highway overlooking “The Pile,” waiting to spring into action to help anyone who got rescued. They stoically stood there all night. No one was ever brought out to them. I think my experience at Ground Zero made me truly understand the fragility of life for the first time. Witnessing first-hand how everything can change in an instant. And learning to observe and listen to the stories people tell as carefully as possible because one never fully knows what another person has lived through, or the cumulative story they bring to an interview with me. I knew there would be a ripple effect of survivors from 9/11, many of whom would be forever shaped by this tragedy. I’d like to think 9/11 taught me to never take the gift of life for granted, and channel that into being a more sensitive and thoughtful journalist in my career.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2021/09/10/i-remember-feeling-sick-to-my-stomach-msnbc-anchor-alex-witt-on-reporting-the-events-of-911/,"‘I Remember Feeling Sick To My Stomach’: MSNBC Anchor Alex Witt, On Reporting The Events Of 9/11"
"Yahoo names a new CEO and begins its path toward revitalization.

"Young girls walking after shopping The pandemic is back in the headlines, casting a long shadow on a battered retail industry.  But, consumer spending remains robust. That’s the good news. Even better news: this year there has been, and is forecasted to continue, heavy investing by retailers in brick and mortar, especially by online merchants.  The mall may be dead (or being repurposed into an Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
  distribution center), but the strip center is alive and well.  The reasons are many. Among them: open-air center rents have come down; customer acquisition costs online have gotten so expensive that physical stores are a better use of capital and a more effective branding tool; and the lingering pandemic has made shoppers wary of large indoor venues. The most common reason given by digital-native retailers is that while online shopping is convenient, it isn’t personal. So, these retailers are hitting the bricks, coming to a neighborhood near you.  Amazon alone is expected to open more than 3,000 physical stores in the next year or two, according to industry insider Adam W. Ifshin, CEO of DLC Management Corp. Amazon Fresh

  grocery stores are already popping up in spaces abandoned by traditional grocery chains or in locations once home to defunct brands like Toys “R” Us. The list of retailers that have announced expansions this year is long, and the number of planned store openings is on track to far surpass closings.  The majority of all those new stores are opening in strip, outdoor, and so-called “power centers” — anchored by big-box retailers. In fact, it appears there’s a renaissance developing in what was once a mundane category. Companies like Macy’s 
  
  M 
  and Lululemon that are shifting to non-mall venues are being joined by direct-to-consumer merchants and digital-native luxury brands like Warby Parker, the eyewear retailer that will mail you five pairs of frames to try before you buy. Warby Parker’s online sales carried it through the pandemic lockdown, but the company is doubling down on its store strategy, planning to end the year with 170 stores, up from 135. Malls and department stores are not coming back, but shopping centers have become the hot new commercial real estate play.  Publicly held operators have seen their stock prices soar.

The line between digital and physical gets blurrier all the time, but one thing remains, the customer needs to remain in the center of the conversation.

" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis can once again bar local school districts from mandating masks after an appeals court on Friday halted a judge’s order blocking the state’s ban, reviving a controversial policy the White House has criticized and some Florida communities have defied.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on July 13, 2020. The state’s 1st District Court of Appeal stayed an earlier ruling by Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper striking down DeSantis’ mask mandate ban, allowing the governor’s policy to remain in effect while the legal challenge winds its way through the Florida court system, according to a Friday court filing. It’s the latest legal tumult in recent weeks for DeSantis’ ban: Cooper struck it down in August after a group of parents sued the state; his order was automatically stayed after DeSantis filed an appeal; and Cooper removed that stay and once again blocked the policy Wednesday after parents argued the ban could cause “irreparable harm.” On Friday, the appeals court said Florida law directs judges to generally stay their orders after they’re appealed by public officials, so Cooper shouldn’t have removed the stay. In a tweet, DeSantis called the ruling “no surprise” and claimed the appeals court “has restored the right of parents to make the best decisions for their children.” Charles Gallagher, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, tweeted he’s “disappointed by the ruling” and will head to the state Supreme Court, warning Florida students are at risk if DeSantis’ policy stays in place. Over the summer, Florida banned school districts from requiring mask-wearing unless families are given an option to exempt their students. If districts fail to comply with this rule, state education officials have threatened to cut a portion of their funding covering superintendents’ and school board members’ salaries. DeSantis has framed the policy as a parental choice measure, but some local officials and families have argued the rule prevents districts from keeping students safe amid a wave of coronavirus infections. Several other Republican-controlled states like Texas and Oklahoma have also tried to ban local mask mandates via legislation or executive order, sparking legal challenges. At least a dozen local school districts have defied DeSantis’ order and imposed mask mandates, including in cities like Miami and Orlando. The state told Broward County and Alachua County it would withhold funding last month, and it threatened to pull funding from several other countries last week. Florida’s policy has drawn scrutiny from the Biden administration. The U.S. Department of Education opened a civil rights investigation into Florida on Friday, probing whether its mask mandate ban harms students with disabilities, according to a letter from federal officials viewed by Forbes. DOE’s Office for Civil Rights launched investigations in five other states with similar policies last month, and said it could investigate Florida if its ban is reinstated. And this week, the White House offered to reimburse school districts whose funding is withheld due to state-level restrictions on mask mandates.

"Keanu Reeves in 'The Matrix: Resurrections' and 'John Wick: Chapter 4' A well-liked Matrix: Resurrections can help Keanu Reeves' John Wick follow in the footsteps of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible and Vin Diesel’s Fast & Furious by breaking out overseas on the fourth try. Yes, I was amused at the online reactions whereby folks were “shocked” by the Matrix: Resurrections images (and eventual trailer) which showed 57-year-old Keanu Reeves looking more like John Wick (whom Reeves only started playing at 49) than Thomas Anderson (whom Reeves first played at 34). I will assume that Mr. Anderson will get a shave-and-a-haircut at some point in Lana Wachowski’s big-budget action sequel, but I digress. If The Matrix: Resurrections pops in December, it’ll only be to the benefit of Reeves’ other ongoing action franchise. A popular, well-liked and successful Matrix 4 could be exactly the shot in the arm needed for John Wick: Chapter 4 to take its overseas box office to the “next level” and became a true-blue “A-level” franchise?  The John Wick movies have earned $43 million domestic and $88 million worldwide in 2014, $92 million/$171 million in 2017 and $171 million/$322 million in 2019. Not even Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War (which threw in Iron Man, Spider-Man and Black Panther) jumped as high from Captain America: The Winter Soldier (from $714 million worldwide to $1.155 billion worldwide) as did John Wick: Chapter 3 from John Wick: Chapter 2. But the films are still making 53% of their global grosses in North America. Money is money, and $581 million worldwide on a combined $145 million budget is more than enough money. Can Lionsgate’s John Wick: Chapter 4 follow in the footsteps of its action spectacular predecessors and bust out overseas on the fourth go-around? The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift grossed $63 million/$159 million in 2006 while Fast & Furious earned $155 million/$363 million in 2009, paving the way for Fast Five ($210 million/$620 million in 2011). The overseas boost for Jeremy Renner’s The Bourne Legacy ($163 million overseas out of $276 million total) covered for a domestic downturn. Matt Damon's Jason Bourne earned a series-high $253 million overseas in 2016 which compensated for “just” $162 million domestic (compared to $128 million in 2002, $172 million in 2004 and $228 million in 2007). Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible movies have always been overseas-centric blockbuster franchise ($439 million domestic and $1.423 billion worldwide over three movies). However Ghost Protocol grossed $209 million domestic and $692 million in 2011.  Heck, one big reason Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow green-lit a fourth Matrix is because of the expanded overseas box office potential (and related PLF/IMAX/dinner theater upcharges) over the 18 years since Matrix Reloaded ($742 million worldwide, a then-record for an R-rated movie) and Matrix Revolutions ($427 million). Presuming a $150 million domestic cume, a similar split to Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation and Fallout would give John Wick 4 a $450-$500 million global. A split like the Daniel Craig-era 007 films ($839 million/$3.175 billion) would give John Wick 4 would give Wick 4 an over/under $565 million global cume. And part of that could be getting global audiences reacclimated to the idea of watching a dressed-to-the-nines Keanu Reeves doing top-tier martial arts and gun-fu. A key is getting overseas audiences to embrace the mere idea of a prestige-level, R-rated, Keanu Reeves action franchise. It’s obviously not apples-to-apples, but if (the presumably/hopefully R-rated) Matrix Resurrections hits it big, well, it’ll make it that much easier to sell John Wick: Chapter 4 globally. There are obviously steps that the John Wick franchise can do/has already done (adding Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins is a good start), and Logan’s $106 million gross in China in 2017 offers hope to the R-rated sequel. Heck, a well-received John Wick 4 should play at least as well overseas as the PG-13 Taken sequels ($236 million in 2012 and $237 million in 2015). A similar 37/43 split would've put John Wick 3 over $455 million worldwide. Such a “fourth time’s the charm” upswing could make John Wick the metaphorical unicorn we’ve been waiting for. Pretty much everything that is earning top-tier box office right now is part of a long-existing brand (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.) or a long-running franchise (Batman, Jurassic, 007, etc.) which has been popular for decades. The Hunger Games grossed $2.9 billion worldwide on a $495 million budget and ended in late 2015. It remains our last “new” live-action A-level blockbuster franchise. Keanu Reeves’ star-driven, R-rated, critically-acclaimed John Wick series could evolve into a “new to cinema” A-level brand. It would be a great irony if the nostalgia-driven return of Reeves’ formally A-list/once-was-unique Matrix movies helped his current comparatively B-level series finally soar to infinity and beyond.

"TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - MARCH 25: Fresh country bread and red wine are served with lunch at the Carmella ... [+] Banahela bistro on March 25, 2008 in Tel Aviv, Israel. World food prices are soaring in the face of what some analysts are describing as a perfect storm of circumstances; increasing demand from developing economies in Asia, rising fuel prices, severe weather impacting recent harvests and an economic shift to biofuel production. All this leaves the consumer paying more for basic staples such as bread and milk and is likely to have its hardest impact on poorer nations. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images) When it comes to drinking blended wines, it’s pretty rare for you to have the opportunity to not only try the blend, but also all of the components that went into making it. The Vice Napa Valley Wines is offering consumers the unique opportunity to do just that through its “The Tri” Tasting kit and virtual tasting experience. The Tri was named and inspired by the small-batch winery’s founder and winemaker Malek Amrani’s passion for not only wine but also triathlons. Get it, Tri. Just like a triathlon contains three parts, the blend contains three different varietals of wine. The kit includes a bottle of The Tri as well as bottles off the single-varietal signature wines that were blended together to create it, specifically St. Laurent, “Majorelle” 2019; Malbec, Oak Knoll 2019 and Cabernet Franc, 2019.  The winery kept just 40 cases of each of the single-varietals for the experiment, with the rest going into creating the blend. The kit allows you to sip through those components on their own along with the blend, as well as try your hand at creating your own unique “Tri” blend from the three wines. “The Tri” Tasting Kit  Even better, you’re doing that tasing on a Zoom alongside not only Amrani, but also Olympic triathlete Joe Maloy. Keeping with the Tri theme, Maloy and Amrani are hosting a series of Zoom sessions to taste through the wines, three of them, obviously. If you buy the kit, then they’re free to attend. Why Maloy specifically you might ask? The percentages of each varietal included in the blend happens to match up perfectly with Maloy’s 2016 Rio Olympic swimming, running, and cycling time percentages: 18% Cabernet Franc, 52% St. Laurent and 30% Malbec. Maloy is a longtime friend of Amrani, who created the wine intentionally using those percentages.  Joe Maloy  The winery says that each varietal was picked at its peak ripeness, fermented and aged separately. The Cabernet Franc and St Laurent grapes come from its Carneros vineyard with a microclimate that is mainly influenced by the water of the San Pablo Bay. The Malbec is from Oak Knoll District, in the heart of Napa Valley. Its vineyard is known for common temperature swings of 40°F between days and nights. The wine is ahed 18 months in French oak barrels.  The third and final installment of the series is happening on September 22nd. That Zoom session will allow you to try all 3 wines, and Amrani promises to also offer some tips on how to enjoy wine better, not just from a taste but from an actual drinking perspective. When you buy a kit you’re also doing a little good in the process — Proceeds from each tasting kit will benefit the USA Triathlon Foundation, whose mission is to make the sport accessible to people of all backgrounds and abilities, so the pleasure of enjoying a glass of wine will contribute to someone’s healthy lifestyle, participation in sports, or even Olympic dreams.

"Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, reacts after defeating Aryna Sabalenka,of Belarus, during the ... [+] semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Leylah Annie Fernandez will play for the biggest title of her life on Saturday in the U.S. Open final — and for a purse of $2.5 million. But her father and coach, Jorge Fernandez, won’t be at the match because he’s “extremely superstitious.” The last time he showed up for one of his daughter’s finals was the 2020 Acapulco final, and she lost to Britain’s Heather Watson. The elder Fernandez made the trip to New York from Florida but will watch the Open final between his 19-year-old daughter and 18-year-old Emma Raducanu of Britain on TV (4 p.m., ESPN).  “No, I am not going to be there tomorrow,” Jorge Fernandez said via Zoom call with reporters Friday. “Yes, I'm extremely superstitious. My daughter is as well.” He added: “Look, I've been using the same shampoo on game day, kind of using the same jeans on game day, I think the same socks and underwear. It's taken to a completely different level. “It's always been that way. It's nothing new. You do your shoelaces a certain way, you do this a certain way. Leylah and I have always kind of, when we figured out what's working, we don't mess with it. That's to a fault, right? Because sometimes you end up messing about with things that you shouldn't mess about with. “It's working, so let's not ruin it. The last time I showed up to a finals it was Acapulco when she made it to the finals and she lost it. I was hating myself for a good two months afterwards. I didn't really want to talk about it. I didn't want to talk to anybody.” The elder Fernandez watched from Florida as his daughter mowed down four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, three-time major winner Angelique Kerber and No. 5 Elina Svitolina to get to the semifinals. He was in New York on Thursday night when Fernandez took out a third top-5 player in No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in three tough sets. The final will mark the the first time since 1999 that two teenagers are vying for the title. That year, 17-year-old Serena Williams beat Martina Hingis in the final after taking out Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport to get there.

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) Both Fernandez and Raducanu play with a poise and power that belies their age, and both have smartly played to the New York night crowds that have quickly bonded with them like they did Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Andy Roddick and other firey American stars. Raducanu enters the match as the slight favorite, as she’s yet to drop a set through her nine matches played in New York, which includes three rounds of qualifying. The two teenagers know one another from the juniors, where Raducanu won 6-4, 6-4 in the Wimbledon juniors a few years back. “Emma made the finals because she earned her right to be in the finals,” Jorge said. “Nobody gave it to her, right? What she did was absolutely fantastic, as well. I mean, c'mon, [beating Maria] Sakkari, this is not just a regular player.” Jorge goes over the game plan with his daughter before each of Leylah’s matches but had yet to do that as of Friday afternoon. “I've yet to finalize any little details to the match plan,” he said. “But so far she's been following the match plan very well. In key moments she's been executing very well. “That's what the focus is going to be as opposed to it's a junior player, she's higher ranked. That just creates more pressure, right? That just creates an expectation of, well, honest, if she was 150... No, unfortunately for me that's a very junior mentality.” Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, reacts after defeating Aryna Sabalenka,of Belarus, during the ... [+] semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Both players have Canadian and Asian ties. Fernandez was born in Montreal. Jorge is a former soccer player from Ecuador and her mother Irene is Filipino. Raducanu’s father, Ian, is Romanian and her mother, Renee, Chinese. Raducanu’s parents moved from Canada to the United Kingdom when she was just 2. “I'm glad that they're touching the Asian community,” Jorge said. “I think that's a huge opportunity in the women's game just to be able to expand and have a new style. Like tomorrow's matchup is 2002, that's their year [when they were born]. You might as well call it the 2002 US Open final. It's silly. “I think it's just positive for the game. Obviously I want Leylah to win. That goes without saying. But I just think that the matchup and what we're seeing, those two ladies are touching a lot of young girls. They're touching a lot of young people. I'm getting messages about, you know, Please pass this to Leylah, little girls saying, You're making us believe. This can only be good for the tennis game and the WTA altogether.” Coming into the Open, there was much speculation about how much interest there would be in the tennis with stars like Serena and Venus Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal all sidelined by injury. Meantime, no American man or woman reached the quarterfinals for the first time ever, while two Canadians reached at least the semifinals (Felix Auger-Aliassime on the men’s side). Yet the tournament has been deemed an overwhelming success — with Novak Djokovic still alive for the first Grand Slam in men’s tennis since 1969 and two teenagers storming their way to the ladies final. “We have to look at the big picture here, right?” Jorge said. “We have to look at something as simple as changing of the guard, right? Who's going to be the next generation that's going to come in? What type of play are they going to bring? I see they're both bringing a type of game that is not common right now on the circuit.

"Coronavirus outbreaks in areas with low vaccination rates are driving such a large increase in demand for monoclonal antibodies that the country is starting to ration supplies, warning even some of the most desperate states—including Alabama—that they need to cut back on their orders of the life-saving treatments, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services told Forbes on Friday.  A man enters the Regeneron Clinic at a monoclonal antibody treatment site in Pembroke Pines, ... [+] Florida, on August 19, 2021. The HHS spoke with public health leaders from seven Southern states last week asking them to reduce their orders of monoclonal antibody treatments by about 30% due to limited supply, the official told Forbes over the phone.  These seven states, which the official could not immediately name but said are located along the Gulf Coast, are facing some of the U.S.’s most severe Covid-19 outbreaks and have been utilizing about 70% of the nation’s distribution of monoclonal antibodies to help reduce hospitalizations in their already overburdened healthcare systems. An increase in demand due to the prevalence of the more infectious delta variant and surges in hospitalizations in states with low vaccination rates have prompted a new distribution strategy from the HHS to ensure patients who need the treatments will be able to get it, according to the official.  This will just be temporary while the federal government continues “actively working to procure more products,” the official said.  Alabama’s State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris confirmed that his was one of the health department’s contacted by the HHS, saying he was alerted “Alabama and some other states are going to be on an allocation,” as reported by the Alabama Political Reporter.   Though the agency has explicitly outlined cutbacks with the group of seven states, the changes will impact the entire country as the HHS will more thoroughly review order requests and utilization rates, and work with state health departments to optimize the distribution of the treatment. The HHS official highlighted that the seven states asked to reduce their orders can ask for more if they need it, but noted the federal government “probably” wouldn’t be able to fulfill the request.  “As a result of this temporary allocation, Alabama will receive less than the amounts previously ordered,” the Alabama Department of Public Health said in a message to healthcare providers, according to Newsweek. “To hopefully assure that monoclonal antibodies are available now and in the future for those patients most at risk, providers are reminded that not everyone qualifies for non-hospitalized patient treatment with monoclonal antibodies.”  While not a replacement for vaccines, monoclonal antibodies have been proven an effective treatment for those infected with Covid-19. The antibodies, which are mass produced in a lab, mimic the body’s immune response to the coronavirus. They are infused into patients with an IV and ramp up the body’s internal fight against the disease. Four different monoclonal antibody treatments have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have proven largely effective at preventing hospitalization and death from Covid-19. The treatment developed by Regeneron, for example, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% in studies.  Covid-19 hotspots have been increasingly turning to monoclonal antibody treatments as they battle massive surges in cases and hospitalizations overwhelming their healthcare systems. In Florida, where more than 90% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds are currently filled, more than 20 monoclonal antibody treatment sites have been opened across the state in recent weeks, and Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to make the treatment “as accessible as possible.” Another state told to reduce its orders, Alabama has been expanding its treatment sites as it grapples with over 180 more ICU patients than beds coupled with a staffing shortage.  As part of its newly announced comprehensive plan for combating the delta variant, the Biden administration on Thursday pledged to accelerate the distribution of monoclonal antibodies. It also introduced “monoclonal antibody strike teams” to deploy clinical personnel to “help hospitals and health systems stand up the delivery of this key treatment option.”  The national supply of monoclonal antibodies could be impacted by the recent reapproval of the treatment co-developed by Eli Lilly and biotech company AbCellera. The FDA stopped recommending its use in late June after it proved ineffective against variants, but re-authorized use again in late August of a combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab as research showed it was effective against the delta variant (Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes). Regeneron spokesperson Alexandra Bowie said in an email to Forbes  the company is aware that demand has “increased dramatically” in recent weeks and is “confident we can manufacture and deliver additional doses” of its treatment if needed.” “There Are Four Covid Antibody Therapies On The Market (And One Close To It).

"Twitch filed a lawsuit Thursday against two users who it says targeted LGBTQ+ and Black streamers with hate speech and evaded the company’s efforts to kick them off, one week after content creators boycotted the game-streaming platform over hate speech.  POLAND - 2020/03/23: In this photo illustration a Twitch logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against users who call themselves ​​“CruzzControl” and “CreatineOverdose,” who Twitch believes reside in the Netherlands and Austria, respectively. Twitch alleges that the pair began targeting LGBTQ+ and Black streamers in early August with “hate raids,” which involves flooding a streamer’s chat with hate comments, often using bots to generate hundreds of malicious comments at a time. Twitch also alleges that the users have evaded bans by creating alternate accounts and generating new combinations of words or “hate raid code” to get around the platform’s hate speech detection systems. The company believes CruzzControl is responsible for nearly 3,000 bot accounts associated with recent hate raids and that CreatineOverdose used bot software to spam racial slurs and threats in chats, claiming “that the hate raiders were the ‘KKK.’” The lawsuit also claims they created software code to conduct automated hate raids and continue to develop the software to avoid Twitch’s measures to prevent bots.  “These actors continue to work hard on creative ways to circumvent our improvements, and show no intention of stopping,” Twitch said in a statement Friday. “We hope this Complaint will shed light on the identity of the individuals behind these attacks and the tools that they exploit, dissuade them from taking similar behaviors to other services, and help put an end to these vile attacks against members of our community.” On September 1, content creators boycotted the platform for a day, using the hashtag #ADayOffTwitch, in an effort to push Twitch to do more to combat abuse and hate speech on the platform. Another campaign in early August by Twitch creator RekItRaven, dubbed #TwitchDoBetter, asked the company to install better tools to combat the growing problem of hate raids. The platform said it would launch channel-level ban evasion detection and account verification improvements later this year. The company also told Forbes it is continually updating its “banned word filters” to help block hateful slurs and is removing bots when identified, and encourages streamers to keep reporting the attacks. Many social media platforms have struggled with hate speech. In July, Instagram announced it was testing a new feature to allow users to lock down their accounts to prevent hurtful comments, after Black players in the English national team faced racist comments on the platform following their loss at the European Football Championship finals. Social media platforms like Facebook already have automatic systems in place to remove posts flagged with hate speech. In May, Facebook said it took down 9.6 million hate speech posts in the first quarter of 2020, the most reported since data started being collected.

The vaccines were slightly less effective at stopping overall infections after delta became the virus’ dominant strain: Unvaccinated people were 4.6 times more likely to catch the virus from late June to mid-July, down from 11.1 between early April and late June, and the vaccines’ effectiveness dropped from 91% to 78% over the same period. Still, the vaccines held up against hospitalization and death, with vaccinated U.S. adults 10.4 times less likely to end up in the hospital and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta surged in late June, a slight decrease from 13.3 and 16.6 before delta’s onset. The CDC said the vaccines were 90% effective at stopping hospitalization and 91% effective at staving off death after June, a small drop from 92% and 94% pre-delta. Another CDC study released Friday found Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine was more effective than its peers at preventing hospital visits amid delta’s surge. Moderna’s effectiveness stood at 92%, Pfizer’s vaccine showed 77% effectiveness and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine stood at 65%, according to data from nine states between June and August. The vaccines were somewhat less effective for seniors, the CDC said. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines were 95% effective at stopping hospitalizations in adults under 65 but 80% effective in Americans 65 and over, according to a CDC study of five Veterans Affairs hospitals. 73.4%. That’s the share of Americans over the age of 12 who have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, according to the CDC. Nationwide, health officials have reported about 350,000 people have lined up for their first vaccine shot every day in recent weeks, up from 220,000 in early July but well below the country’s mid-April peak of 2 million. The United States has faced more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths per day since mid-August, following a summertime surge in coronavirus infections. Health experts have blamed the uptick on the virus’ more transmissible delta variant, but officials have also raised alarm at plateauing vaccination rates, with vaccine uptake lingering below 60% in some states, leaving many communities vulnerable to Covid-19 outbreaks and hospital capacity crunches. The Biden administration is pressing unvaccinated people to get inoculated: On Thursday, the White House imposed a firm vaccine mandate for federal employees, and officials laid out plans to compel private employers with more than 100 employees to require their staff to either get vaccinated or submit weekly Covid-19 tests. “The bottom line is this: We have the scientific tools we need to turn the corner on this pandemic,” Wakensky said in a Friday press briefing. “Vaccination works, and will protect us from the severe complications of Covid-19.” Unvaccinated 29 Times More Likely To Be Hospitalized In L.A., CDC Says (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/10/unvaccinated-11-times-more-likely-to-die-of-covid-cdc-says/,"Unvaccinated 11 Times More Likely To Die Of Covid, CDC Says"
" The U.K.’s Prince Andrew, who stepped down from royal duties in 2019 over his friendship with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, was served with court papers Aug. 27 of a civil lawsuit brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, one of the most vocal of Epstein’s accusers, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was underage.  Prince Andrew, Duke of York, attends the Sunday Service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Windsor ... [+] in April. Process server Cesar Augusto Sepulveda wrote in a report filed in court in New York on Friday that he left the affidavit with police officers on duty on the grounds of the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, Andrew’s home since 2003, and that when he asked to meet personally with the prince, security told him it would not be possible. Sepulveda tried to serve the papers the day before, but wrote that it appeared security staff had been “primed” to not accept any court service. Giuffre’s legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes. The lodge where Andrew was served is just miles away from Windsor Palace, reportedly his mother Queen Elizabeth’s favorite royal residence and where British media reported he has been hiding out in recent weeks. Andrew stepped down from royal duties in 2019 over his longtime friendship with Epstein, whom he continued to spend time with even after the financier was convicted and jailed for soliciting underage girls in 2008. Andrew has denied any wrongdoing, and says he offered to help in the Epstein probe on three separate occasions, contradicting statements made by New York federal prosecutors who said last year the prince “completely shut the door” on lending a hand to investigators. The first hearing in the case is set for Monday in New York. Giuffre’s legal team told Forbes last month that if the prince ignored the lawsuit they would target Andrew’s assets as much as international law allows. The U.S. and U.K. do not have a reciprocal agreement to enforce respective court judgments. Giuffre has said since 2015 she was forced by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, a wealthy member of high British society and friend of Andrew’s, to have sex with the prince as a teenager in New York, London and on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Giuffre is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the prince over “severe and lasting” effects stemming from Andrew’s alleged abuse. Epstein committed suicide awaiting sex trafficking charges in August 2019, and Maxwell has remained in custody since her 2020 arrest on sex trafficking charges.  Prince Andrew Sued In U.S. Court By Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Virginia Giuffre (Forbes) Prince Andrew Gives First Public Interview Since Stepping Down As A Working Royal Over Epstein Ties (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/09/10/prince-andrew-served-with-lawsuit-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser/,Prince Andrew Served With Lawsuit By Jeffrey Epstein Accuser
"Head coach Kevin Stefanski will try to become the first Browns coach in 17 years to win the first ... [+] game of a season. (AP Photo) Expectations for the Cleveland Browns are sky high for this season, but perhaps the biggest mountain they must climb is putting an end to one of the most inglorious runs of futility in franchise history. It’s been 17 years since the Browns had a record of 1-0. Think about that. Following week one of the NFL season, half the teams in the league will have a record of 1-0, but history says the Browns won’t be one of them. Or, maybe history says the Browns WILL be one of them. Doesn’t the law of averages eventually kick in somewhere? Wouldn’t you think over the last, say, five years the Browns would have been 1-0 in one of them? Nope. Ok, how about the five years before that? Surely, there had to be a 1-0 start for Cleveland in one of them, right? Wrong. The five years before that? Ditto. Seriously, how hard can it be? We’re not talking about reeling off 10 wins in a row to start the season. Or eight in a row. Or six. We’re merely talking about reeling off one win in a row to start the season. We’re talking about winning the first game. We’re talking about the extremely modest achievement of going into Week 2 with a record of 1-0. You know, the same record with which the 1972 Dolphins went into Week 2. Those Dolphins, however, won all their games, going 17-0, including a victory in the Super Bowl. In other words, in the last 49 years there have been more undefeated teams in the NFL than there have been times in the last 16 years that the Cleveland Browns had a record of 1-0. Not even the arrival of NFL Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski last year brought an end to the 0-1 blues. In their exciting 11-5 turnaround season last year, when they reached the postseason for the first time in 18 years and won a postseason game for the first time in 23 years, the Browns’ record after the first game of the season was, yep, you guessed it, 0-1. The last time the Browns had a record of 1-0 was 2004, under coach Butch Davis. In a 20-3 win over the Baltimore Ravens in Cleveland, Browns quarterback Jeff Garcia led the home team to victory by completing 15 of 24 passes for 180 yards and one touchdown, a 24-yard pass to Quincy Morgan in the third quarter.  The Browns’ other points came on two Phil Dawson field goals and a three-yard touchdown run by Garcia. Suitably inspired, the Browns went on to lose 12 of their last 15 games, finishing with a record of 4-12. Since 2004, the closest the Browns have come to not losing their first game of the season was in 2018, when they played the Steelers to a 21-21 overtime tie. That was their first game since their epic 0-16 season in 2017, which followed their nearly-as-epic 1-15 season in 2016. All of which is exactly the point. The Browns’ decades-long inability to post a record of 1-0 is the most dramatic example of the depths of ineptitude to which the team sank since the Browns re-entered the NFL in 1999, following three fallow years, after owner Art Modell moved the franchise to Baltimore. All that, however, is now ancient, aching history, following the arrival of Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry, who have led a rapid, dramatic turnaround for a franchise that had spent most of this century chasing its tail. Since their return to the NFL in 1999, the Browns’ combined record in their first games of each season is 1-20-1. That includes a 38-6 loss to Baltimore last year, in Stefanski’s first game as coach. But then he orchestrated a breathtaking reversal of fortunes, the highlight of which was the Browns’ 48-37 win at Pittsburgh in a wildcard game – Cleveland’s first playoff win since 1994 – that Stefanski watched on TV, from home, in his basement, due to COVID. Trying to put a halt to the Browns’ long winless streak of season-opening games won’t get any easier for Stefanski and his team this year. On Sunday, in Kansas City, the Browns will play the Chiefs, whose two trips to the Super Bowl the last two years are two more than the Browns have made in their entire history. But Cleveland hasn’t had a coach this good, or a roster this loaded, in forever, and the fan base in northeast Ohio is delirious with delicious anticipation over the start of the season. Sunday will be the Browns’ first and only chance this year to do something they haven’t done since Baker Mayfield was nine years old: Be 1-0.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimingraham/2021/09/10/can-the-cleveland-browns-shake-a-lamentable-streak/,Can The Cleveland Browns Shake A Lamentable Streak?
"RH...and ABC have seen good times and bad times... (Photo by Roger Kisby/Getty Images for ... [+] Restoration Hardware) The juxtaposition of news this week from RH and ABC could not be any more telling about the state of the home furnishings retail business specifically and the overall retailing sector.  One company put up astonishing numbers. The other filed for bankruptcy. That they both use letters for their names only joins them at the alphabetic, as well as the topical hip. The contrast — and similarities too — between the two operations are a little chilling. RH, which itself was almost given up for dead not all that long ago, has rebuilt, reinvented and pretty much revolutionized itself over the past 15 years, moving from a purveyor of oddball housewares and dated mission furniture to the nation’s largest upscale home furnishings retail chain.  Its move beyond just selling furniture and home décor accessories into restaurants, bars, hospitality including hotels, charter jets and yachts took it to new places no retailer had even been to before and it plans to accelerate that path with moves overseas and into total residential environments. ABC, which goes by the full name ABC Carpet & Home, has had a reverse timeline. At one time it was probably the most admired, most envied and most watched retailer in the entire home furnishings space. Its special blend of unique product, dramatic presentation in its historic home in the Flatiron district of Manhattan and a commitment to cause-related retailing made it a standout, unduplicated anywhere else. But its reliance on in-store business and its slow acceptance of e-commerce were devastating during a pandemic when Manhattan was largely a ghost town.  It had only begun to recover from the twin hits of the 9/11 terror attacks on lower Manhattan and the 2008-2009 Great Recession, downsizing its flagship complex and retrenching its merchandising, when Covid hit. It was one crisis too many and its century-long history is now threatened to melt down in bankruptcy proceedings. Maybe it will come out of it, but as we know, most businesses are never the same again. These two events, occurring as they did within 48 hours of each other, only underscore how tough the retail business can be…but also how brilliant leadership can make a difference. Certainly that’s the case with Gary Friedman at RH today but let us not forget that during ABC’s heyday in the 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, the husband and wife team of Paulette and Evan Cole were every bit as innovative, creative and awe-inspiring. And even when they split up and Paulette Cole continued to lead ABC, her merchandising savvy and social commitment to causes and emerging makers and designers around the world were things nobody else was doing then…and are still not doing.  Given a different time ABC might have made the transition to become successful again, just as RH did a decade ago. But they say timing is everything in life and for ABC, the time was wrong…just as for RH it is right. Each, in their own way and their own time, has been an extremely significant retailer in the home furnishings space and whatever ultimately happens to ABC – and RH for that matter – both those in the trade and consumers who shop at these stores should not forget that.  Retailing can be very cruel…and very rewarding.

"On October 31, 2021, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) will kick off in Glasgow, Scotland. Once more, the parties will try to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. So, we must ask the perennial question: what could move the world from talk to tangible action?  A Model That Worked  Our current 1.1° C of climate change is already tragic and costly. An annual litany of climate disasters – heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical storms and floods – is the new normal, says the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although the IPCC claims we still have time to halt climate change to 1.5° C, current policies have us on route for 2.9° C of warming according to the Climate Action Tracker. People are growing anxious, and no wonder: “Nearly 1 in 3 Americans experienced a weather disaster this summer,” reports The Washington Post.  An annual litany of climate disasters is the new normal, says the latest report from the ... [+] Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As climate change gets closer to home, the effectiveness of the international cooperation to battle it is being questioned. Yet, there is reason to be optimistic. Recall that in July of this year, 130 countries came together to end a different systemic abuse that jeopardized the prosperity of future generations. They agreed to set a minimum corporate tax of 15%. No longer can multinational corporations so easily use tax havens and loopholes to evade their social responsibilities. They will now contribute their fair share to infrastructure, education and other common goods. If 130 governments set aside their differences for $150 billion (USD) per year in collective tax revenue, surely they can close the carbon havens and loopholes that may obliterate $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2050. Once again, they’ll need to move in concert and pull financial levers.  No Cost for Procrastination  If today’s emissions levels persist, we’ll use up the 1.5° C carbon budget within 10 years. Although cleantech innovation is attracting record levels of funding, a decade is not much time to execute an energy transition. The market is in no rush to deal with climate change because procrastination seems financially rewarding. In most countries, there is no penalty for continuing to invest in fossil fuels or burning them. Quite the opposite. BloombergNEF estimates that G-20 governments subsidized fossil fuels to the tune of $3.3 trillion between 2015 and 2019. In the U.S., intangible and tangible drilling costs (IDCs and TDCs) are still 100% tax deductible for investors. In China, coal consumption more than tripled between 2000 and 2020, abetted by government subsidies.  Unsurprisingly, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre finds that 60 of the world’s major banks have invested $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016. These same institutions make grandiose claims about their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. At this point, the $35 trillion ESG market has little to do with the energy transition. InfluenceMap, an independent think tank, found that 72 out of the 133 climate-themed equity funds it studied (55%) were misaligned with the Paris Agreement.

  dissident Tariq Fancy.   Bigger Sticks and Sweeter Carrots If we are serious about maintaining a habitable climate, then divestment from coal, oil and gas and the end to fossil fuel subsidies are insufficient. There can be no havens or loopholes for capital that accelerates climate change or postpones the energy transition. At COP26, we need to set more transparent targets that are immune to meaningless offsets, carbon accounting tricks, greenwashing and greed. Here is what I propose: 1.    Set National Quotas for Fossil Fuels By my estimate, we need to stop burning coal by 2030, oil by 2035 and natural gas by 2040 for 1.5° C to be feasible by 2050. The 2040s can be a “phase out” decade when carbon offsets are still permitted. 2050 is the hard cutoff when fossil fuels need to be retired completely.  All that requires an international agreement with fossil fuel quotas. Otherwise, governments will continue to fear that if they cut fossil fuel usage while others don’t, economic competitors will gain an unfair edge.  2.    Tie Compensation to Fossil Fuel Targets Several well-known energy companies, including Shell and Total, have tied executive compensation to emissions reductions. It works if the emissions bonuses are more financially rewarding than stock options that grow in value with increased fossil fuel sales.   Worldwide, 20% of c-level compensation in every organization, but particularly in the financial industry and in government, should be tied to carbon emissions targets. All business leaders and elected officials should be included. The targets should be based on the fossil fuel quotas described above and on the impact outlook of ESG investing. As for how the latter could work… 3.    Minimum Taxes and Rebates for Investors       I propose tax minimums that deter investors from exploiting carbon havens while rewarding cleantech investments that could accelerate the path to net zero. Higher costs of capital in the fossil fuel industry would ripple into carbon-intensive industries, reinforcing the quotas and compensation proposals discussed above. By targeting monied investors rather than regulating everyday consumption, these policies also avoid a showdown reminiscent of the debates around COVID-19 masking and lockdowns.  The framework of global minimum taxes and rebates for investors can be rather simple: ●     A global minimum new tax rate of 2% on investments in fossil fuels that increases each year by 2%. (Hence, by 2031, the rate would be 20%). ●     A global minimum tax rate of 1% for investors in Big Tech, the divestment community’s favorite haven. This tax rate also increases by 1% each year, reaching 10% by 2031. ●     A neutral tax on low-risk clean investments, like solar, wind and hydropower. ●     A 2% minimum rebate or complementary subsidy for investments in carbon reduction technologies and projects (e.g., carbon capture and regenerative agriculture) as well as systems for climate adaptation (e.g., wildfire detection and flood prevention technology). These increase by 1% annually over the next 10 years ●     A 4% minimum rebate or complementary subsidy for investments in platform technologies for the energy transition such as fusion energy, hydrogen, and other clean, scalable, baseload power solutions. These rebates increase by 2% annually for the next decade.  From Talk to Tangible Action The accelerated impact of climate change begs for accelerated action. If 130 countries could agree to a global minimum corporate tax, I believe they can negotiate fossil fuel quotas, corporate governance rules and minimum investment taxes that close carbon havens and drive capital to the energy transition. If this summer is any indication, we cannot afford 2°, 3° or 4° of warming. We need bigger sticks and sweeter carrots with clear accountability, and we need them now.  The task before our leaders at COP26 is to rally the world behind a plan that can achieve net zero by 2050. Wish them wisdom and strength.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/walvanlierop/2021/09/10/no-more-carbon-havens-and-esg-greenwashing/,No More Carbon Havens And ESG Greenwashing
"Derek Kerr speaks at US Airways media day in 2013 in Scottsdale, Ariz. (Laura Segall) Asked what made him most proud during the past 18 months, as the airline industry endured the lingering pandemic, American Airlines CFO Derek Kerr responded forcefully, “I’m most proud of saving the jobs.” “I’ve been doing this for 30 years; this is something we’ve never seen,” Kerr said Thursday, referring to the pandemic.  “We saved a bunch of jobs: that was key for us.” Kerr credited the CARES Act and the unprecedented joint effort by the airline industry and its labor unions, working together to influence legislators, for the achievement. On the management side, he noted, American CEO Doug Parker was most engaged in enabling the coalition with labor.  Kerr cited “incredible work between the labor teams, Doug, A4A [industry lobbyists], working with government to show how important this industry was, to keep the airline running, and to keep the jobs here. .“We couldn’t have done it without the labor unions. Without their help in DC, we would never be where we are today.” Kerr said. “I’m really proud of what Doug did,” he said. Kerr, spoke at the Cowen transportation investor conference in Boston. His career in airline finance began in 1991 at Northwest Airlines: subsequently he was CFO for America West, US Airways and American, while Parker was CEO at all three. Kerr was questioned by veteran airline analyst Helane Becker. During the pandemic, Congress provided $39 billion to pay the salaries of tens of thousands of employees at passenger airlines. For airline labor, the programs known as PSP (for payroll support programs) represented a historic achievement. Unions helped write the legislation and then advocated for it, working with management, particularly Parker,. His engagement has been acknowledged by Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, and the most visible labor leader during the legislative battle. Still, Kerr’s insight came at a delicate moment for labor relations on American, because this week, the Allied Pilots Association, which represents 14,000 American pilots, announced it is planning airport demonstrations focused on the carrier’s occasional summer operations breakdowns. Philadelphia pilots even called for management resignations. At the conference, Becker asked Kerr if he was surprised by the pilots’ announcement, “given how well Doug seemed to work with everybody last year.” Kerr responded, “We’ve been working very well, working hand in hand with (labor unions). Doug’s done an incredible job making sure that was a focus for the company. “We have had some issues as we’ve grown the airline back,” Kerr said “Some of that has affected our employees.” Specifically addressing the planned pilot demonstrations, he said, “That’s their prerogative as a union.  “During the summer we did have some issues with growing the airline back, some weather issues,” Kerr said. “No one’s ever gone from a 50% airline to an 80% airline in eight weeks – we could have done it better.” APA spokesman Dennis Tajer said Friday, “We’re grateful for the collaborative effort to secure the government investment to save jobs and our airline, but that also obligated management to make sure they were ready for the recovery and they weren’t.  “We were ready and our passengers were ready, but management wasn’t,” Tajer said. “Our CFO said management is working well with unions, but if they were working well with the pilots, we wouldn’t be picketing for their attention to repair our airline’s operation.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2021/09/10/american-airline-ceo-joined-unions-to-save-jobs-during-pandemic-but-now-they-diverge-on-summer-ops/,"American Airline Exec Says ‘Most Proud Of Saving Jobs’ During Pandemic, Thanks Labor Unions."
"FOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS - SEPTEMBER 27: Cam Newton #1 of the New England Patriots yells during ... [+] warm ups before the game against the Las Vegas Raiders at Gillette Stadium on September 27, 2020 in Foxborough, Massachusetts. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) Cam Newton is just 32. So, even though he hasn’t been that Cam Newton in seven NFL seasons, he wasn’t wrong Thursday, when he thought about all of the 32 starting quarterbacks in the league, rushed to his Instagram page and declared, “I’m gonna remove all doubt. I said it once. Now, I’ll say it again: there’s not 32 guys that are better than me, bro. And let’s be honest.” Yep. There might be only 31 guys better than Newton as starting NFL quarterbacks.  As for that one who should give his job to Newton, well, um. Come to think of it, maybe there are 32 guys better than Newton as starting NFL quarterbacks, at least when it comes to the overall fit for a franchise. Newton still doesn’t get it. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have returned to social media Friday to make his situation worse, but first, what was Bill Belichick thinking? If any of the following sounds confusing regarding this guru of the New England Patriots, ranked No. 2 by Forbes in NFL team evaluations at $5 billion, then you’re among the sane:   So, with that as a background, Newton said the following (among other things) Friday during a YouTube Live video with his father, Cecil, while they sat at the football field of Cam’s old high school in Atlanta. ""If they would have asked me, 'Cam, we're going to give the team to Mac [Jones], you're going to be second-string; we expect you to be everything and some to guide him throughout this tenure,' I would have said, 'Absolutely.' But listen, the truth of the matter is this: He would have been uncomfortable.""  Uh huh. It got worse. ""The reason why they released me is because, indirectly, I was going to be a distraction, without being a starter. Just my aura. That's my gift and my curse. When you bring Cam Newton into your facility [and] your franchise, people are interested by mere fact of 'Who is he? Why does he wear his hair? Why does he talk? Why does he act? Why does he perform?' All these questions."" Cam still doesn’t get it. Dude, it wasn’t the best talking (and acting) that way during your prime with the Carolina Panthers, along the way to three Pro Bowl trips during the first five of your nine seasons with the team. But this is nuts. As I once wrote — referring to Newton winning the NFL’s Most Valuable Player Award in 2015, while taking the Panthers to the Super Bowl before losing to the Denver Broncos — the following was tolerated by those in the Panthers’ organization during Cam’s first five seasons in the league, but it wasn’t embraced: That dabbing, that cupping of his hand to his ear after doing whatever he thought was otherworldly, the exaggerated first-down signals, the pouting on the sidelines and during press conferences. Then came Newton’s four years after that 2015 Super Bowl season, when the Panthers went 23-23 with an injury prone quarterback whose production kept declining.  Suddenly, those Cam things weren’t tolerable anymore. In March 2020, the Panthers gave Newton permission to find a team willing to make a trade for his services, but nobody wanted him. The Panthers released him a few weeks later into free agency. Then, four months later, Belichick, Mr. Boring, decided to sack logic by filling the massive hole on his roster after Brady bolted for Tampa with Newton, Mr. Flash. Even though Newton left his drama in Carolina, it didn’t matter. He couldn’t play. Well, he could run. He rushed for 592 yards and 12 touchdowns, but he ranked 24th in the NFL in passing yards (2,657). Worse, he threw more interceptions (10) than touchdowns (8). That meant Newton’s decline reached a fifth consecutive year.  If Newton wished to have a shot at starting again in the NFL on a full-time basis, he needed to do two things: (1) Get better and (2) stay away from saying stuff like, “Just my aura. That's my gift and my curse.” It’s too late on both things.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/terencemoore/2021/09/10/cam-newton-is-sacking-his-nfl-future-beyond-new-england-patriots-with-his-play-and-his-mouth/,Cam Newton Is Sacking His NFL Future Beyond New England Patriots With His Play And His Mouth
"Colombian musician J Balvin arrives for the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards at the Prudential Center in ... [+] Newark, New Jersey on August 26, 2019 | Johannes Eisele / AFP via Getty Images The so-called “Latin boom” at the turn of the century introduced the world to groundbreaking new artists like Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin. While these artists continued to release music in the following two decades, Latin artists — specifically making Latin music — were mostly relegated to the background in the pop music landscape. But a new generation of artists emerged in the 2010s and helped bring reggaetón back into the mainstream. J Balvin was one of these artists. The Colombian breakout star has often cited reggaetón pioneers Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón as influences in his own music, and he’s worked to carry on the flame himself with music, apparel, brand partnerships, a Super Bowl halftime show, and more.  His sixth solo album JOSÉ is out today, and serves as a formal reintroduction to the reggaetón star on a more personal level than ever before. The album’s release was preceded by the single “In da Getto,” a collaboration with dance music stalwart Skrillex, and “Qué Más Pues?” with Argentinian pop singe María Becerra.   Much like the recent releases from Drake and Kanye West, JOSÉ is a lengthy project intended to function more like a playlist than a cohesive-sounding album. The album clocks in at nearly an hour and a half, and runs the gamut from tried-and-true popetón on songs like “Fantasías” and the Yandel collab “Te Acuerdas De Mí” to the ever-popularizing beats of dembow on “Perra,” a collaboration with Dominican breakout star Tokischa.  In just a few short years, J Balvin has become one of the most prolific Latin music stars in the mainstream today. He’s consistently put out an album every year since 2018, and seemingly has a different brand collaboration or endorsement deal every other week. He’s become one of the industry’s most bankable Latin music stars, and critics often attribute it to an age-old trope in the entertainment world: using a white face to market and popularize Black art — in this case, reggaetón.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2021/09/10/j-balvin-reintroduces-himself-with-jose-album/,J Balvin Reintroduces Himself With ‘Jose’ Album

If it plays “normal” over the next month, it could end up with around $215 million domestic. Strong weekday grosses, a lack of competition and generally solid buzz are all factors in its favor.  If the film’s domestic/overseas split hasn’t changed, then the film’s global total is now $210 million. So if it’s not over $200 million already, it will be by the end of this sentence. While nobody is expecting James Wan’s (surprisingly great) Malignant to top the box office this weekend, it’s likely to gross at least enough to take second place. Presuming that happens, it’ll be the first time I can find (please let me know if I missed one) where the top two movies at the domestic box office are both helmed by Asian directors.  FREE GUY Relative to budget and expectation, the R-rated original horror flick is good enough to absolutely deserve its own #GoldOpen. Because, as always, championing diversity in cinema is more than just the latest superhero movie or the designated #representationmatters event movie. Not that Wan needs the boost, as this “I can do whatever I want!” freak out is one of the better “one for me” entries in our modern tentpole era. But if you want blockbuster filmmakers to still make offbeat, one-for-me studio programmers in between the franchise fare, well, “vote with your wallet.”  The film will actually play via streaming in China this weekend, which is a rarity for an R-rated horror flick and the first time I can remember such a thing since Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (which earned $159 million in early 2017). Speaking of China, Free Guy earned another $2.5 million (-32% from last Friday) for a new $66.6 million total. Not only is that an excellent hold, but it’s about to top the $66.6 million Chinese totals for Chris Nolan’s Tenet. That Free Guy is just the third Hollywood flick to do so since 2020 after Godzilla Vs. Kong ($188 million) and F9 ($216 million) merely highlights how impressive Tenet’s non-domestic grosses were a year ago.  Nonetheless, that an original, star-driven, high-concept flick like Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer’s Free Guy is pulling this off is incredibly encouraging on a number of levels. It also yet again debunks conventional wisdom about what Chinese moviegoers want out of Hollywood. Presuming no huge differences in the domestic/overseas split, Free Guy is now just over $250 million on an over/under $115 million budget. In a skewed way, the likely over/under $300 million global finish for Free Guy is even more impressive than wherever F9 ($710 million and counting) and Shang-Chi (around $210 million thus far) end up, since only one of those isn’t part of an established big-deal franchise.  ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/10/movies-box-office-shang-chi-tops-jungle-cruise-free-guy-tops-tenet-in-china/,Box Office: ‘Shang-Chi’ Tops ‘Jungle Cruise’ In U.S. As ‘Free Guy’ Tops ‘Tenet’ In China
"  Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) used the recent news story of five pet zebras running loose in the suburbs of D.C. to issue a satirical press release denying any involvement in their escape Friday, and plugging her pet issue of D.C. statehood in the meantime.  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton poses onstage during the Congressional Black Caucus' Annual ... [+] Legislative Conference's Phoenix Awards Dinner in 2019. The zebras in question escaped from their home in Prince George’s County, Maryland, last week, when Norton said that she was “enjoying quiet time at home with family” who would back up her alibi. Norton said any charges of her involvement were “understandable,” given her track record of emphasizing the “importance of having consent of the governed,” as well as her “recent opposition to fences.” Her reasoning referenced one of her main legislative projects, D.C statehood, and her work in recent months to have the fencing put up around the U.S. Capitol building in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots torn down. Norton’s communication director Sharon Eliza Nichols told Forbes in a statement the Friday press release was satirical and a “tongue-in-cheek” way to tie current events to Norton’s legislative priorities, build goodwill and get the congresswoman’s name out in the media. The dazzle of zebras have been on the loose for more than a week after escaping from a 39-zebra farm near Upper Marlboro, roughly 20 miles southeast of Washington, D.C. County officials told the Washington Post the zebras, traveling in two groups of two and three individual zebras, have been spotted and reported by at least four residents in the area. The zebra’s owner has a permit from the United States Department of Agriculture to keep the exotic animals on his property, Prince George’s County officials told the newspaper, but warned residents zebras can be dangerous. “Never approach them, and don’t try to pet them,” the county’s animal services chief Rodney Taylor told the Washington Post. “They’re not going to chase you down. But they are zebras, so they’re not handled by people a lot, so to defend themselves they could bite.” Zebras run wild after escape from a Maryland farm (Washington Post)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/09/10/dc-congresswoman-plugs-dc-statehood-as-she-denies-setting-escaped-zebras-loose/,DC Congresswoman Plugs DC Statehood As She Denies Setting Escaped Zebras Loose
"Image of Almansa castle in Castilla la Mancha, Spain A secret garden of vineyards sit at 2,300 feet and beyond in elevation within a tiny wine region called Almansa in Spain, surrounded by limestone mountains called El Mugrón that protect the old, dry-farmed bush vines that are ungrafted as it is a place that is quite isolated from anything from the outside world. Ungrafted vines are always a remarkable sight in Europe considering that European vineyards were almost wiped out completely by an American pest called phylloxera, hence why many European grape vines are grafted onto American rootstocks to combat it. Almansa soils are mainly made up of limestone and they are poor in nutrients and the combination of having such a soil with an arid, cooler climate makes it difficult to grow anything besides cereals, olive and almond trees and vineyards that produce low yields. Close up of old bush vine It is a town that, many times, gets passed up as one drives from Valencia on the central eastern coast to the city of Madrid without the person knowing that in their rearview mirror is a special designated wine region that specializes in such unique dominant red grape varieties such as Garnacha Tintorera (known as Alicante Bouschet in France) and Monastrell (known as Mourvèdre in France). But if European wine history has taught the wine world anything it is that many wine regions were never fully discovered because there wasn’t a strong enough transportation infrastructure to assist them with getting their wines to markets in major cities and the wine regions that became popular early on were able to construct vital infrastructures to vital markets.  It is amazing that these old bush vine vineyards were able to survive in a tiny delimited wine region in Spain that had no fast track to fame, especially considering that the European Union was paying vineyard owners to pull up their vines as there was a European wine surplus - combined with these low yielding vines make it difficult to make a living when they are tragically being blended away into bulk wine; even the Spanish Civil War, from the mid to late 1930s, played a part as many of the wine producers from the small town of Almansa either died in the war or were part of the hundreds of thousands of people who just went missing during and after that time. Yet one family was able to continue on and kept these old bush vines alive: Bodegas Piqueras.  Bodegas Piqueras Luis Piqueras started making ‘jug wine’ for his neighbors in 1915 and he was one of the few locals that had the great fortune of coming into a significant amount of money in the late 1920s and hence he was able to buy a large plot of land where he would build a modern winery over time. Luis’s son-in-law Mario Bonete went on to study winemaking and today, Mario’s son, Luis’s grandson, Juan Pablo Bonete Piqueras runs the winery with his brother continuing to strive to showcase these vineyards so they will survive for generations to come. As Juan Pablo (known as JP1) was standing in his tasting room surrounded by black and white photos of his grandfather and father, he stated that his father, Mario, established the Almansa DO in the 1960s to make sure it was recognized as a quality winegrowing area. “In fact my father was the president of the DO for more than 18 years and I was also the president of the DO for eight years,” Juan Pablo said with pride as it is very much a family mission to keep the Almansa wine region alive with his brother, nephews and soon to be his son joining the fight. And considering there are only 12 wineries that are a part of the DO and 750 grape growers with Piqueras producing over 80% of the wines from the Almansa DO, if Piqueras decided to close shop it would have a massive negative effect on the region. Luis Piqueras The winemaker of Bodegas Piqueras, Juan P. Cantos, affectionately called JP2, is another one who has joined the fight after spending many years learning from other wineries around Spain, as well as a harvest to refine his white winemaking skills in New Zealand, and he even won a competition to become a winemaking student at the legendary Spanish winery Vega Sicilia. Interestingly enough he was born in Almansa but his winemaking dreams took him to other places until four years ago when he decided to come back home mainly due to family and friends but he discovered in the process of coming back that there was a wealth of old bush Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera vines. Bodegas Piqueras with surrounding vineyards during the winter Juan Cantos is very well aware that the red variety Monastrell is not only better known coming from the Southern Rhône (Mourvèdre) but also from other areas of Spain such as Jumilla and Yecla – the latter being a wine region he has already previously worked in, and that Garnacha Tintorera a.k.a. Alicante Bouschet is a rare red variety from Southern France with red flesh as well as dark skins yet has recently made a strong name for itself in Southern Portugal, its often proclaimed adopted home. But Juan Cantos makes a case for those who love these grapes, and those who are curious about them, that the Almansa wine region is a place that shouldn’t be missed but getting that message out is difficult because their budget as a wine region is severely limited due to only having a handful of wine producers in the region. Wealth of Old Vines in a Modest Wine Region  View Of stars against the sky at night with a tree slightly lit up in Almansa, Spain Bodegas Piqueras makes a few different lines of wine and the ‘Castillo de Almansa’ is the most widely distributed; one can find them in the U.S. from $12-$15 and although they are their middle tier wines, they still contain 45 to 65 year old dry-farmed Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera with the ‘Selección’ containing Monastrell, Garnacha Tintorera and Tempranillo from 65 to 90 year old dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines. Then their premium line of wines go by Piqueras such as their ‘Piqueras VS’ that contains 50% Monastrell and 50% Garnacha Tintorera from dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines that are over a century old, and the VS is such a beloved wine that it is the only one that Juan Cantos and Juan Pablo Bonete Piqueras sign. Juan Cantos has been working on a couple of fun projects such as the ‘Piqueras Wild Fermented Verdejo’ white wine and the newly released ‘Los Losares’ which are two different single varietal wines from a single vineyard that is 3,000 feet in elevation containing a stony soil with vines that are over 80 years old; there are two bottlings, only 6,000 bottles made of each, one is from the old dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines of Monastrell and the other with Garnacha Tintorera.  It is still a struggle to get the word out about these special vines that are off the beaten path, tucked away in this limestone mountainous area of Almansa but at least there is a producer such as Bodegas Piqueras who has been able to guarantee a paycheck for these farmers year in and year out for over a century; if it wasn’t for Piqueras, potentially all of these old, ungrafted vines and a way of life that involves traditional vineyard farming techniques would be lost as other places around the world are certainly much more famous and can command higher prices, unlike the unknown Almansa. And to think, it all came down to one day, the day that the founder Luis Piqueras bought a lottery ticket for eight pesetas and he ended up winning the equivalent of $50,000. That not only changed everything for the home winemaker to invest in building a professional winery but it changed the courses of actions that could have taken place for the entire winemaking area as the farming families would have to grub up these precious vines just so they could put food on the table. And it is only fitting that a woman who runs their administration office in logistics is the granddaughter of the man who sold Luis that ticket. A moment in time that altered the future lives of so many yet this community is still hoping to get to the next level... where the globe recognizes the value they bring to the wine world.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathrinetodd/2021/09/10/spanish-family-winery-survival-saves-century-old-ungrafted-bush-vines/,Spanish Family Winery Survival Saves Century-Old Ungrafted Bush Vines
"New York Knicks guard RJ Barrett (9) drives on Indiana Pacers forward T.J. Warren (1) during the ... [+] second half of an NBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Wednesday, Dec. 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Indiana Pacers forward T.J. Warren has been out since December 2020 with a navicular stress fracture in his left foot. The Pacers never provided a defined timeline for Warren to return to action, and he didn’t play for the remainder of the 2020-21 season. This offseason, though, signs of Warren’s health status improving began to emerge. He shared a post on Instagram showing that he participated in a group workout with other Pacers players in California. Roughly two weeks later, Warren tweeted, “I played basketball today. I had fun.” It appeared as if the dynamic scorer was trending towards being ready to return to action at some point in the not-so-distant future. But on Tuesday, an announcement from the Pacers cast doubt over that line of thinking. The team provided an update on Warren’s injury, stating that, “Warren’s stress fracture in his left foot is healing during the rehabilitation process; but not at the pace previously anticipated. He remains out indefinitely.” This update doesn’t provide a clear timeline for Warren to return to action, but the fact that the Pacers needed to release this brief suggests that he will miss at least some amount of time to open the 2021-22 campaign. Training camp begins in just a few weeks, and Indiana’s starting point guard, Malcolm Brogdon, indicated on The Woj Pod that the Pacers will come back two weeks early to prepare prior to training camp. That timeframe is in just a few days, so Warren will be unavailable for some upcoming team workouts. An injury to a projected starter before the season even begins is a huge blow for the Pacers. Indiana had multiple players miss extended time this past season and were hoping for better health in 2021-22 — both to improve as a team and get a better feel for how the team’s core fits together. “My goal for this last year was to be healthy and be able to look and figure out what this team needs for the future,” Pacers President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard said in May. “We just didn’t see [the team] together.” Caris LeVert, who the blue and gold traded for in January of 2020, has never played with Warren. Reserve forward Oshae Brissett started 16 times for Indiana last season, yet he has never shared the court with Warren. Newcomers Chris Duarte, Torrey Craig, and Isaiah Jackson won’t be running mates with the Pacers starting small forward until he returns from injury. The NC State product missing time will delay Pritchard’s desire of seeing the team together. “Pacer fans. Just wanted you to hear this straight from me. I’m making sure I do this rehab process right so that I can get back on the court as soon as I can and be the best that I can,” Warren tweeted after his injury update was released. Another delay in seeing the Pacers starting five together will prolong a continued frustration for the Indiana front office. But that is a secondary detriment when compared to the loss of simply not having Warren’s production. The 28-year old was a 20 points per game scorer in his last fully healthy season for the Pacers and evolved into a useful and effective defender. That’s a lot of scoring, and defense, to lose. Last season, Indiana deployed various starting lineups with Warren on the shelf. Justin Holiday was a part of the opening five 52 times for the blue and gold last season; his ability to knock down threes and play quality team defense makes him a fit with any unit. He could start again if Warren is sidelined to begin the season. Doug McDermott also started a handful of games in Warren’s absence during the 2020-21 campaign, but he joined the San Antonio Spurs this offseason, so new Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle cannot go to that as an option with Warren out. Indiana Pacers' T.J. Warren (1) dribbles during the second half of an NBA basketball game against ... [+] the Boston Celtics, Sunday, Dec. 27, 2020, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) Rookie wing Chris Duarte, who the Pacers drafted with the 13th overall pick in the draft just a few weeks ago, could be in line for a bigger role with Warren on the shelf. As could Torrey Craig, who Indiana inked to a two-year deal in August. The Pacers do have other forwards that can soak up minutes while Warren heals. But none of them can match his contributions, especially offensively. “Getting your top scorer injured for the rest of the year — it’s almost insurmountable,” Pritchard said of losing the seven-year veteran last season. That sentiment will likely be true again to open the coming season. A clear timeline for Warren’s return has not been provided, the Pacers’ statement simply states he is out “indefinitely.” The amount of time he misses may play a huge role in how successful Indiana is able to be next season — the team has a brutally hard schedule for the first month or so, and the more of that span Warren misses, the worse things could go for the Pacers. The team is 45-26 (63.4 win percentage) when he plays during the last two campaigns and 34-40 (45.9 win percentage) when he doesn’t. His impact on winning is massive. “T.J. Warren has been scoring his whole life,” former Pacers star Victor Oladipo exclaimed in 2020. “[He] was born to get buckets.” Other wings and forward can fill the playing time hole that Warren’s updated injury timeline creates, but the scoring burden will need to be taken on by others. LeVert, who averaged nearly 21 points per game for the Pacers last season playing without Warren, and Brogdon will likely receive more touches and will have to find a way to put up points until Warren returns. But replacing a 20 point scorer is hard, as Pritchard noted. The Pacers will be tasked with doing exactly that, at least for some time. With some of the team already in Indiana and many others set to descend upon downtown Indianapolis soon, as Brogdon noted, the blue and gold will be without Warren as they get back into the swing of things. The amount of time the talented wing misses will have a massive bearing on the Indiana Pacers’ season, and the team will hope that this setback is extremely minor. If not, the team will need to pivot to other strategies on the wing — and other players will need to step up.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyeast/2021/09/10/tj-warren-healing-at-slower-than-expected-pace-indiana-pacers-must-pivot-on-the-wing/,"With T.J.

"Michael W. Smith at live recording of new ""Worship Forever"" album in Nashville, Tennessee. Twenty years ago, on September 11th, 2001, Michael W. Smith veered a bit from the contemporary Christian music he’d previously, to release an album full of praise and worship music. It was less the type of music people were listening to on Christian radio, and more of what is typically heard in church.  “It was the very first sort of record like that I’d ever done,” Smith explains. “I’d been a worship leader at my church for 19 years, so it wasn’t hard. I just tried to pick the best songs I could. Released on 9/11, the day of the horrific terrorist attackson America, Worship went on to become his best-selling album to date. Smith, a three time GRAMMY-winner and one of Christian music’s most successful artists, believes the album did so well, because it gave people hope and comfort, at a time they desperately needed it.  “I think it really became a healing record for our nation,” Smith says.  This year, to mark the album’s anniversary, he came up with the idea to re-record the album with the power of a full orchestra behind him. It would be called Worship Forever. “I started to think about the 20th anniversary of 9/11 coming up and my crazy idea was, what if I went back and recorded that record, but with a completely different approach. What if I did it with a full orchestra? So, I pulled up my orchestra templates on my computer and began to experiment. And after two or three songs, I thought, I can make this work.” That new, re-imagined version of the album, recorded live in Nashville this past July, becomes available today. It’s also accompanied by a TV show set that premiered Friday night on TBN, but will air again on Saturday, September 11th at 2:30pm ET/1:30pm CT and Monday, September 13th at 5pm ET/4pm CT.  Michael W. Smith's new album ""Worship Forever"" Along with the orchestra, under the guidance of concertmaster, David Davidson and with David Hamilton as conductor, the album (and TV show) features guest appearances by Amy Grant, Tauren Wells, and Matt Redmond. Smith says the live recording went surprisingly well.  Michael W. Smith and Tauren Wells during live recording of ""Worship Forever"" album in Nashville, TN Amy Grant at the live recording of ""Worship Forever"" in Nashville, Tennessee. “Of all the things that could have gone wrong, you’ve got one shot with a lot of moving parts, a lot of people on stage, very little rehearsal time, and it was just a beautiful evening. And not only did it come off great in terms of audio-wise, but we also filmed it and it turned out extraordinary.” And he thinks people will be pleasantly surprised to hear those familiar songs with all of those different instruments added to the mix. “When you take songs like ‘Heart of Worship,’ or ‘Draw Me Closer,’ or ‘Above All,’ and you’ve got this full orchestra at your back, I mean the hair is standing up on your neck. When you combine a worship experience with a big symphony orchestra and those arrangements, it’s a beautiful thing!” The timing of Worship Forever, which comes exactly two decades after the original album seemed to help soothe a hurting nation, is not lost on Smith. Today, when Americans are so divided, he hopes this music can help heal again. “In the midst of not only heartache, but this pandemic, the world, Afghanistan, then there’s earthquakes, floods, and Hurricane Ida, it’s a little overwhelming,” he says. “I think we have more in common than not and we’ve let things divide us. Everybody is fighting and that’s not the way we’re supposed to do life. So, I hope this record can maybe just kind of pull us together and help us heal.” Along with his work on Worship Forever, Smith has been busy as with an upcoming film called The Jesus Music that documents the history of Christian music. He was approached by the Erwin Brothers (Filmmakers Jon and Andrew Erwin, the two men also behind the film I Can Only Imagine), and asked if he’d join the project as Executive Producer. He’s been watching it all come together through edits and revisions, and is excited about its October 1st release.  “First and foremost, this story has never really been told. I mean, we’ve read books about it, people have done some history on Christian music, but the whole story has never been told, especially on the big screen. And what I love about the film is it has some rawness to it. There’s been a lot of drama on some level throughout these past five or six decades and the film shows the struggle. It talks about the love of God, but in the midst of all of that we’re just trying to figure it out and sometimes we make mistakes. I’m glad they show the human side because that’s part of life.” As he celebrates the new album and the upcoming film, Smith is also getting ready to hit the road for his fall tour. Even after more than 35 years in the business, he’s constantly creating, always moving forward, and consistently working to share this music with new audiences. He says songs of faith, like those on Worship Forever can connect with people and make a difference, when words cannot.   “I still believe, and I’ve believed it my whole life that music is the most powerful universal language in the world. A three-and-a-half minute can change somebody’s life. And that’s one of my hopes for this record. I think it has the ability to draw us together.” Michael W.

  is investing in the development of a new service that will let customers experience live concerts and other audio events through its popular voice-activated devices. While no timeline has been announced, the e-tail giant is working on an offering adjacent to its music streaming platform, Amazon Music, which would bring live concerts, radio programs and podcasts to Alexa users, according to a report by Axios. The move looks like an attempt to keep up with services like the newer audio app, Clubhouse, and other tech and social media giants, like Spotify, Twitter and Facebook, which have been making their own entries into facilitating live and interactive audio. Amazon has already made a move into localized podcast content, such as news and sports, with the $300 million purchase of a startup called Wondery in 2020. In an online discussion last week, some of the industry insiders on the RetailWire BrainTrust saw the move as a savvy way for the e-tail giant to become ever-more ingrained in the daily life of the consumer. Close-up of the base of an Amazon Echo smart speaker using the Alexa service, with Amazon logo ... [+] visible, on a light wooden surface, San Ramon, California, May 31, 2018. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) “This is just another way to connect with their customers through Prime and to expand Amazon’s reach further into media,” wrote Kai Clarke, CEO of American Retail Consultants. “No company plays dominoes better than Amazon,” wrote Professor Gene Detroyer. “Every development is a connection to the previous business and provides a connection to future businesses.” “Brilliant move to shape habits and add value to Alexa users,” wrote Lisa Goller, content marketing strategist. “Starved for the thrill of live entertainment events, more consumers will tune into Amazon to connect with their favorite artists and friends. (Especially if new lockdowns lie ahead.) This move will make Prime membership and Alexa adoption more attractive with magnetic media for the masses.” Media and entertainment companies appear to be developing an interest in leveraging voice-based technology for marketing and content delivery. However, getting customers to move beyond searching, listening or otherwise consuming content and into actively shopping is proving to have its own set of issues. For some on the BrainTrust, a live music endeavor would not go far in addressing them. “Live concerts feel too far off from shopping for consumers to make the transition from using one feature to the other,” wrote Melissa Minkow, retail industry lead at CI&T. “Given how much of a hurdle voice adoption has been, it would take something much more differentiated in value, yet still closely related to shopping for this new initiative to succeed as an entry point.” “Personally, I’m not sure the juice is worth the squeeze,” wrote David Weinand, chief customer officer at Incisiv. “There is absolutely no substitute for live music in my opinion and using voice to listen to a live show may have some appeal but how much someone would be willing to pay for it is another story.” “Granted, it may make Amazon ‘stickier’ with customers, but this service will compete with a lot of others out there,” wrote Jennifer Bartashus, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “When it comes to voice-activated orders, however, there is still a lot of hesitancy on the part of consumers to use it heavily for e-commerce. The perceived risk of getting the wrong product or size is still high for many shoppers.” A recent survey from Vixen Labs found that, once again, the top use for voice assistants was to ask a question, with 37 percent doing so regularly, followed by checking the weather (35 percent) and asking the device to play music (33 percent). Other ways adults are using voice assistants regularly include searching for info on products and services (22 percent), making calls (22 percent), sending messages or emails (18 percent), automating tasks in order to save time (16 percent), controlling integrated household tech (16 percent) and checking personal calendars (15 percent). Only 11 percent used their smart assistant to make purchases. Last year, eMarketer downgraded its forecast for voice-based shopping, despite the uptick in adoption of voice assistants by consumers. Other studies indicate, however, that this may be changing. Research by Juniper anticipates that purchases made via voice assistant will reach $19.4 billion by 2023, up from $4.6 billion this year. The researchers expect an increase in shopping as the technology continues to improve and manufacturers add screens to voice-based offerings like smart speakers. Dave Bruno, director of retail marketing at Aptos, noted that there could be one major factor that determines if offering live concert content works for Amazon at all. “I suspect how they price/monetize this new service will have a huge impact on adoption,” wrote Mr. Bruno. “I don’t love what they have done monetizing Wondery podcasts, and I am pretty sure I am not alone in my indignation when content from Amazon is not included with my ever-escalating Prime fees.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2021/09/10/will-live-streaming-audio-boost-alexas-volume/,Will Live Streaming Audio Boost Alexa’s Volume?
"Sir Philip Green Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green will raise $534 million from the sale of his iconic Oxford Street flagship store to IKEA, according to reports Friday, as the last piece of his Arcadia Group’s controversial bankruptcy process slots into place. The reported price, just $48 million shy of its reported optimistic $582 million asking price in May–and in the midst of the pandemic lockdown–is a huge boost for Green, who is struggling to pay down the massive debts accumulated by his bankrupt Arcadia retail empire. The sale of the property will allow Green to fully repay the $425 million mortgage on the store, owed to U.S.-based private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The remaining $109 million will be used to help satisfy a larger pool of claims against Arcadia, the total of which was reported by administrators Teneo to have hit $2.4 billion in July. IKEA is bidding to bring another store to London's heart Last week Forbes reported that a second round of bids for the property had arrived and were being considered. Those bids were said to be “in excess” of the $425 million owed. The reported deal cannot be confirmed or denied by the property’s administrator’s Redcastle until it goes through, according to a spokesperson. The reports were also not fully denied by IKEA. A spokesperson for the Swedish furniture giant told Forbes that although it is “exploring” new locations “as part of a new city centre approach” the company currently has no plans to share its expansion strategy at this time. Despite IKEA being a store largely dependent on customers driving to the store and parking there, retail consultant Nick Budd described IKEA’s reported bid for London property as a “smart move,” adding that the unit has plenty of room for pick-up items like plants and plates and a couple of restaurants. Nike and Vans currently have outlets in the building and they will not be required to close once IKEA arrives, according to reports. IKEA already has a very similar, much smaller, outlet known as a “planning studio” on Tottenham Court Road, in an area famed for its furniture stores. Arcadia—the empire of 400 stores and 13,000 employees that included U.K. household names like Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Burton and Wallis—fell into bankruptcy in November last year. In July, administrators published an update, saying that total claims against Arcadia topped $2.4 billion, including a $700 million deficit in the company’s pension plan for Arcadia's former workers. Since then, Teneo, Arcadia’s administrators, has sold off more than ​​$820 million of assets to help cover the debt, including the sale of famous brands like Topshop, Top Man, Miss Selfridge and HIIT to competing retailer ASOS in February; the sale of the Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis brands to competing retailer Boohoo, also in February; and the sale of Evans to City Chic in December 2020. Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Sir Philip Green and Rita Ora However, in the July progress report, Teneo gave the clearest statement yet that the money collected from the sale of Arcadia’s assets would be far less than the money owed by Sir Philip’s failed retail empire. With the secured debt–the Apollo loan and a separate $255 million in secured pension debt—now covered, Teneo said in July that “[F]unds will be released to enable a distribution to be made to unsecured creditors of c.10p in the £, based on total expected claims of c.£1.8 billion,” adding that, “[t]he remaining unsecured element of the Pension Trust debt will not be paid in full, dividends will be in line with those paid to other unsecured creditors.” In other words, Arcadia has only been able to pay 10% of every British pound it owes to its unsecured creditors. Teneo again would not comment or offer guidance on the potential size of the pension deficit or offer specifics on how the money raised will be allocated on Friday, but any significant shortfall will likely rouse the ire of U.K. politicians, who voted to strip the Green of his knighthood in 2016, after selling BHS for £1 in 2015. (Green still retains his knighthood.) The department store promptly collapsed the following year without clearing the chain’s pension deficit. After a public outcry, Green was forced to pay $461 million from his own pocket to settle the debt. Forbes estimates Philip & Cristina Green to be worth  $2.4 billion—largely built on a $1.7 billion dividend from Arcadia, which they paid themselves in 2005.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2021/09/10/ikea-to-the-rescue-the-furniture-chain-may-buy-topshop-billionaires-london-store-for-500-million/,IKEA To The Rescue?

"Inspiring story of viral video about a deer can be leveraged to learn about AI and self-driving ... [+] cars. A recent viral video caused a lot of head-scratching and rapt wonderment. It provides a breathtaking story, entirely seen visually and absent of any narration (thankfully so, allowing for our uninterrupted attention to the altogether moving pictorial saga itself). Let me walk you through the action as though your perchance happened upon the video while otherwise perusing your usual dose of social media. Assume that you came upon the video on a random basis and opt somewhat leisurely to click on it, mainly out of curiosity about why it has garnered so many views. The opening scene consists of a seemingly pleasant and innocuous green pasture that is surrounded by a lush forest. Grass in the untamed pasture has grown relatively high, providing for a bit of hiding coverage for any petite-sized animals that might opt to go out into this verdant open space.  A rabbit has ventured out into the grassy area. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking, you are right that the rabbit is about to get a rather unpleasant surprise. Please prepare yourself accordingly for what happens next. Out of view of the fixed-in-place video camera (affixed to a tree or some such supporting structure), a hawk must have been flying in the sky above the pasture. All that we know and catch a fleeting glimpse of is an ominous shadowy figure that shockingly and surprising swoops down upon the rabbit. It happens in an eye-blinking split second.  One moment the rabbit is hopping along without a care in the world, and the next moment it finds itself in the clutches of fearsome talons. Yikes! The hawk is doing what hawks do. While this nimbly flying creature is now on the ground, it is trying to voraciously turn the rabbit into a tasty meal. A mighty struggle ensues. The prey is desperately trying to fight back against the determined predator. We hear the faint and frantic squealing of panicked cries coming from the rabbit as it does whatever it can to getaway. The odds though of escaping are extremely slim.  Hawks have fine-tuned this kind of predatory machination and the rabbit is presumably and inexorably not long for this earth, sadly so. But wait for a second, this story has only just begun. Out of nowhere, a young deer suddenly scampers into the pasture. We aren’t sure what this deer has in mind. It sprints in a circular fashion around the engrossed hawk and rabbit. Is the deer going to take a close look at the life-or-death battle underway? Will the deer merely scamper back out of the pasture and leave the struggling pair to whatever ends that destiny or fate shall decide. Get ready to drop your jaw and become utterly mesmerized by what happens next. The young deer attacks the hawk. Say what? Yes, the deer attacks the hawk. One kind of doubts that the hawk was giving much due to the deer, prior to that moment, and logically assumed that the deer would simply move along. It seems likely that hawks quite frequently might perform ferocious attacks on small animals and be amidst larger animals while doing so. It also seems likely that those larger animals would tend to scurry away and not want to get involved in someone else’s fight.  Who can blame them? Self-preservation would seem to be the axiomatic approach for any nearby observing animals. Those larger animals have their own set of predators to be worrying about. That being said, if an eagle was possibly flying around, it might relish seeing the hawk on the ground. Eagles are considered predators of hawks. We would not be especially surprised if an eagle took advantage of the hawk as the ground-based struggle was taking place. The eagle would be all too happy to catch the hawk unawares. But a deer opting to intervene, well, you’ve got to admit that is something unexpected and assuredly astonishing. But there’s more! The rabbit manages to escape from the hawk. This indubitably makes sense. That hawk is now being pounced upon and being ransacked by the young deer. This is one heck of a beat down by the deer. As some have stated, we watch as Bambi seemingly transforms into Rambo. The hawk tries to get away, fluttering its wings and going toe-to-toe with the deer. Vicious fisticuffs are at work here. If the deer had done this to simply distract the hawk, the job was completed. Excellent work. The rabbit was free and seemed to entirely get away, hopping anxiously back into the wooded area where the hawk would have little chance of rediscovering the prey. For the deer, it was time to call it quits, one would assume, and the deer could merrily move on and pat itself on the back for having done a good deed and preserved an itty-bitty rabbit’s life. And yet the battle further ensues. For several long minutes, the hawk and the deer go at it, fiercely. This is far more than an attempt by the deer to scare the hawk or startle the hawk into having given up the rabbit stew that was on the plate for today’s dining. We don’t know for sure what the two have got going here. The deer is absolutely determined to do what it can to dispense with the hawk. Think about that famous fictional character known as the Hulk, and how there is a sudden transformation from one moment being relatively withdrawn and reserved, which then metamorphizes into this muscular overpowering hulking thing. That’s what seems to take place with this deer. Eventually, we can see that the hawk is becoming less and less combative. The deer has clearly prevailed. Some have suggested that the hooves of deer can have sharpened edges that are akin to polished knives. The fact that the hawk was pinned to the ground by the deer and pummeled and slashed at by the hooves, you would certainly expect that the hawk would lose that kind of a streetfight skirmish. Toward the end of the video, another similarly sized deer enters the pasture. As this newcomer approaches the conquering deer that has taken to task the hawk, the victorious deer momentarily moves menacingly toward the approaching interloper, getting the interloper to back off. This recurs a couple of times. One interpretation is that the triumphant deer does not want to share its hard-fought winning spoils. There are other possible interpretations too. That is the gist of the video and we are then left to our own devices to decide what we have just witnessed. I’d wager that it is a rock-solid bet that most people would be completely taken aback by the idea that a deer would not only attempt to shoo away a hawk that is already in the middle of a battle with a rabbit, but even more so that the deer would continue long after the initial disruptive action had succeeded. The myriad of posted comments reinforces that incredulous notion. What’s up with that? We think of deer as herbivores. They love to munch on leaves and plants. We see them idly grazing around in pastures and forests. Perhaps that’s what adds to our beloved adorability of deer. I dare say that nearly all of those Saturday morning cartoons and ongoing animated portrayals of deer seem to stridently abide by that preordained script. Before you read the next paragraph, I will warn you that it isn’t going to proffer pleasant news. You might want to skip around it. Scientists emphasize that deer are considered omnivorous, and thus they will indeed eat meat (whoa, exalted gasp!). This is somewhat rare for deer to do. Usually, the deer would have to be quite hungry. Furthermore, the situation would typically need to present itself on a silver platter, such as if the deer came upon a ground-based bird’s nest and realized there were defenseless hatchlings to be had. Generally, whatever meat might be eaten has to be easily made into munchable morsels since deer do not have the usual natural equipment for the arduous ordeal of eating raw meat. Sorry if that ruins your dreamy imagery of deer. We are now ready to take a running leap at how to interpret the video. Some argue that the deer was aggressively hungry. It saw that the hawk was vulnerable and distracted. The deer calculated that this was the perfect moment to get a nearly free meal. All it had to do was a sneak attack on the hawk, thus the basis for going around at the first encounter, and the rest would be glorious history. Maybe so, some concede. But the hawk was still active, alive, and proving demonstrably that it could put up a fight. That’s not at all like going after an animal that might be a hatchling or perhaps already injured and possibly feeble. Trying to go at a hawk that was amid battle status would seem poorly calculated and doesn’t provide a convincing case, they counterargue. Plus, the grassy area and surrounding forest appeared to be replete with tons of food for the deer, unlike if it were the dead of winter and food sources were covered in deep snow. Here’s another take. The deer heard the cries of the rabbit. It is conceivable that those cries are similar sounding to those of a fawn. The deer rushed to save what was believed to be a fellow deer. Running past the two, the deer realized it was simply a hawk and a rabbit. Nonetheless, now that the deer was close enough and judged that the upper hand was now at play, the deer decided to pounce on the hawk. There are multiple variations of that version. Perhaps the deer and the rabbit were already friendly toward each other and had earlier bonded. If that wasn’t the case, it could be a natural instinct that the deer and a rabbit would have toward each other, regardless if they had ever met before. And so on. Hang onto your hat, there are more interpretations to be considered. Maybe this particular deer was ticked off at hawks, either this specific one or at hawks in general. It could be that a hawk had previously attacked a fawn and this deer was either the one attacked or that it saw a fellow deer that got attacked. In any case, this deer has had a festering hatred for hawks. Hawks were on the list of creatures to be excised if possible. Under that scenario, the deer ostensibly had come upon a situation of incredibly good luck. Finally, a hawk was in the right place at the wrong time. This deer, harboring for perhaps a long time the burning desire to someday right the wrongs of this planet by trouncing a hawk, finally got its wished-for chance. That’s why this hawk was not ever going to escape from this now superhero deer. This was payback time, aplenty. You can go on and on about the underlying rationale for the actions that transpired. Before I get into the overarching theme that I want to explore herein, it is probably prudent to include another viewpoint about that video of the deer. Some lamented that the deer ever got into the fray. They pointed out that the hawk was merely seeking to survive and that part of the cycle of nature is that hawks will grab up rabbits. Life is tough that way. Making the hawk into the baddie is unfair, some would assert. The deer should not be made into a hero. It interfered. In addition, you ought to cast the deer in the same sour light as that of the hawk, in the sense that if the deer was trying to eat the hawk, this could be construed as equivalent to the hawk trying to eat the rabbit. Just wanted to include that further perspective on the matter at hand. What can we glean from all of these disparate interpretations? First of all, there is something natively and intrinsically fascinating about having a situation involving a prey caught by a predator (the rabbit getting caught by the hawk), which then is summarily overturned when a different “predator” of a predator enters into the matter and takes out the initial attacker.  That being said, this is more than just fascinating when an unexpected overtaking occurs, such as by a deer that attacks a hawk. This is breathtaking since we would not expect a deer to take this stance and seeing this happen makes you stop in your tracks and think mindfully about the world around us. Some of our most basic assumptions about how things work can suddenly become topsy-turvy. This provides a handy lesson for us that we might find useful to employ in other contexts.  Are you ready to shift gears and yet simultaneously apply the lessons learned from this endearing saga? I hope so. Let’s talk about self-driving cars. The future of cars consists of AI-based true self-driving cars. There isn’t a human driver involved in a true self-driving car. Keep in mind that true self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle. For my extensive and ongoing coverage of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and especially self-driving cars, see the link here. Here’s an intriguing question that is worth pondering: How might the saga of the deer and the hawk and the rabbit provide insights into the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars? I’d like to first further clarify what is meant when I refer to true self-driving cars. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Car As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task. These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there. Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.  You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3 Self-Driving Cars And Unexpected Aspect For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can. Why is this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient? Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car. Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic. I brazenly might begin by saying that a deer, a hawk, and a rabbit walk into a bar. Zing! That’s a bit of tongue-in-cheek levity and I’ll leave the rest of the curveball to your imagination. Moving on to some serious considerations, one aspect that I just mentioned moments ago concerns the desire that we ought to not anthropomorphize AI. In that same vein, many scholars worry that we oftentimes anthropomorphize animals too. There is an ongoing debate about how much thinking we can ascribe to animals. Years ago, some argued vehemently that humans were thinkers while animals were not. This for example was claimed to be proven by the aspect that humans made use of tools, while (presumably) animals did not. Such a difference was held forward as a basis for asserting that humans think but that animals don’t. Since then, the tools matter has been debunked in the sense that there are animals that indeed do make use of tools. Etc. Anyway, the reason that I bring this up is that the viral video of the deer is an immediate kneejerk reacting possibility to ascribe all kinds of thinking processes to the animals involved in the intriguing struggle. Was the deer “angry” at hawks and thought mindfully about attacking the hawk, or did the deer simply react in some inherently preprogrammed way to the situation at hand? Will the rabbit possibly someday seek to save the life of the deer, doing so because it has contemplated the lifesaving efforts of the deer and therefore aims to intentionally repay that debt in the future? I’m not going to dig more deeply into that philosophical debate here, though you might find of interest my discussion on such topics at the link here. Also, you might find of further potential interest that there had been attempts at getting dogs to drive a car. Yes, you read that correctly. The question was whether a dog has sufficient intelligence to be able to drive a car. We all pretty much seem to accept that dogs do some amount of thinking, and if so, perhaps this could be directed toward driving a car. Here is my coverage at the link here. That’s enough on those side tangents. I’d like to focus for now on the earlier highlighted theme that sometimes the things that we think that we know are not entirely apt. Here’s how this applies to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars. One of the biggest and loudest debates about having self-driving cars doing tryouts on public roadways is that this should not be happening at this time. Some vehemently oppose those tryouts. They argue that until self-driving cars have been shown to be safe for our streets, they ought to not be on our highways, byways, and avenues. The use of computer-based simulations is argued as being the right way to proceed, and only after the simulations are essentially completed would actual autonomous vehicles be deployed onto our roadways. Do the simulations first. If the simulations showcase that self-driving cars are safe to be on the roads, so be it. If the simulated self-driving cars are unsafe in the simulation, they aren’t ready for being around us and nearby to us all. When you drive your car and come upon a self-driving car, the thing is that you don’t know what that self-driving car is going to do. Is the AI driving system up to snuff? Will it react in the proper way to all variants of driving settings?  Even if you aren’t driving near a self-driving car, you might be a passenger in a human-driven vehicle that comes across a self-driving car, thus endangering you. You might be a passenger inside a self-driving car, and therefore endangered by what it will or might not do. Pedestrians are likewise in danger. It would seem obvious that simulations ought to be undertaken.  And, they are, which is something that by and large the automakers and self-driving tech firms are glad to tout. They relish emphasizing the number of millions of miles that they have done in their simulations for their self-driving cars. That would seem to shut the case closed on those decrying that simulations need to be undertaken. Not so, the retort quickly arises. Here’s the rub. The simulations are taking place and meanwhile, the self-driving cars are on our public streets. That’s not the way things are supposed to work, say the simulation proponents. You do all of the simulations, and then, maybe you put self-driving cars on the roads. In essence, once all of the simulations are done, you look at what it showcases. If the results are demonstrable that self-driving cars are cleared to be on our roadways, sure, go ahead and ergo proceed. Doing public roadway trials while simulations are ongoing is likened to building a skyscraper before you have figured out all of the architectural rigors. It’s a bad idea to take a chance on something that has not yet properly been sounded out via simulations. The cart has been placed in front of the horse, as it were. The next aspect of the simulations-first argument is that the existing simulations also tend not to be fully realistic. A concern raised is that the simulations are computer-based mockups of what cars do and what happens on our streets. Some of the simulations have no direct bearing on the physics of the real world, and they are more akin to those fun playing video games about driving cars. Some simulations are much more robust and rigorous than the game-playing kind, but many of those are even still said to be a dollar short at fully portraying the realities of real-world driving. There are various counterarguments to this simulations-first precondition.  One is that simulations are handy but cannot replace on-the-road driving and the consequent vital feedback that will be had from the real world. It is argued that only via having actual self-driving cars on actual roadways can you glean what you need to know to make self-driving cars viable. Some would then say that you can get that real-world driving experience by using special closed tracks, also known as proving grounds. Take your self-driving cars there. Try them out to your heart's content. They are typically on private lands and completely fenced off from the public roadways (not always, some exceptions exist).  In that manner, you can use simulations and use real-world driving, though the real-world driving is being done separate and apart from the public, which protects the public from any endangerment while the self-driving cars are being put through their paces Now that I’ve dragged you through all of that, you might be curious about how that deer, hawk, and rabbit fit into this picture. Remember that viewers of the viral video seemed to be quite surprised that a deer would opt to attack a hawk and continue the attack unabated and seemingly unashamedly so (well, let’s not veer into anthropomorphic territory there). An issue that is front and center about the use of simulations and likewise the use of closed tracks is that those are devised by mankind and are presumably and potentially constrained by what mankind thinks is worthy of including. In short, those that insist on public roadways tryouts are quick to emphasize that the real-world of open-ended driving will reveal various edge cases and unusual driving settings that by conventional thinking would not have been set up or tested in any simulation or proving ground settings (for my coverage of edge cases in the making of self-driving cars, see the link here). What are edge cases? The wild and shall we say unpredictable nature of the public roadways bring forth driving scenarios that nobody would have prior thought to include. For example, see my discussion of the woman and the mountain lion, at this link here and others mentioned frequently in my columns. What we think that we know can be a blinder to what we need to know. Those that advocate stridently for the public tryouts assert that encountering real-world “unpredictable” situations via the public roadways is the most sensible path toward discovering what we don’t know and what we do need to know. Of course, that’s a debatable contention and one that doesn’t sit well with the ardent simulationists. Conclusion That whole topic about whether to be doing public roadway tryouts is a hornet’s nest of contention. On that, we can likely all agree. I’ve discussed additional twists and turns in my columns and won’t cover those again herein. The handy aspect of the deer story is that it reminds us that we at times might have preconceived notions that are not correct. There is that old line about making assumptions is a slippery slope and you need to be cautious when doing so (since it makes one into the butt of the matter). Another takeaway is that the next time you are wandering in the woods and see what seems like the cutest of Bambi deer, do not let your conditioning by cartoons and movie portrayals mislead you. Those deer can do one heck of an eye-opening awe-inspiring smackdown, so be dutifully be wary and give them some proper street cred. I’d bet that any hawk reading this column and worth its salt is going to think twice the next time they see a rabbit that has a grazing deer nearby.

"On Thursday, September 9, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce (E&C) released the legislation that they intend to mark up starting on Monday, September 13th. The legislation is sweeping and touches many aspects of American life. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hopeful that the House can pass this legislation, along with other sweeping legislation passed by several other House committees, by the end of the month.  The audacity of this effort—an attempt to pass hundreds of big-government proposals with an extremely limited opportunity for public debate—may be unprecedented. The health care provisions would substantially increase federal government control over America’s health sector with broad new spending, tax, and regulatory programs. These proposals would create many problems, including punishing life-saving medical innovation, exacerbating Medicare’s financial problems, lavishing hundreds of billions of additional taxpayer dollars on health insurance companies, and creating a variety of slush funds for special interest groups to pillage. Below are a dozen particularly bad problems. 1)     Reducing Pharmaceutical Innovation and Lowering the Quality of Americans’ Lives The E&C proposal would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services “to determine the maximum fair price” of many pharmaceuticals. These prices would not simply apply to government programs but would also impact private coverage. Empowering the Secretary of HHS to set the prices of prescription drugs will reduce incentives for innovation and will lead to fewer lifesaving and life-enhancing medications. The Secretary of HHS does not possess the information, nor have the right incentives, to properly set pharmaceutical prices. If this becomes law, prices will be set by relative lobbying power of interest groups, and the market’s valuable, natural ability to best meet unmet needs will be thwarted. In 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that providing the HHS Secretary with such sweeping authorities will reduce the number of new treatments by one-third over ten years. According to the CEA, this would lower American life expectancy by about four months and have total economic costs that dwarf any benefits from lower prices. The most negatively affected would be vulnerable populations with serious health conditions. Remarkably, the E&C proposal would punish the American innovation that produced the vaccines in record time to help rescue the world from COVID-19. 2)     Artificial Limits on Price Increases Will Lead to Shortages The E&C proposal would require drug manufacturers which increase their prices faster than inflation to pay back that excess amount to the federal government. Fundamentally, price increases can be societally beneficial if demand rises or if supply contracts. The price increases serve to get products to people who need them most and to incentivize other suppliers to bring additional product or suitable alternatives to market. Restricting price increases will impede these beneficial market responses and ultimately harm patients.  3)     Drug Prices Have Actually Been Falling, Unlike the Significant Inflation Characterizing the Rest of Economy Federal fiscal policy, with massive increases in government spending and debt, is contributing to the significant rise in inflation. The Labor Department reported that inflation was 5.4 percent from July 2020 to July 2021. While inflation is high, one significant area where prices are falling is prescription drugs. According to the Labor Department, prescription drug prices fell by 2.5 percent during that same period—which is somewhat remarkable given the general rise in prices. Declining drug prices are a trend that has persisted for several years, with significant credit due to the Trump administration’s prioritization of new generics and using competition to lower prices.  Drug price inflation versus overall inflation Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics.  4)     Expanding Medicare is Irresponsible Given the Program’s Deteriorating Finances Last week, the Medicare trustees—all Biden administration appointees—issued the annual Medicare trustees report. The report is full of bad news, such as “Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation. Such legislation should be enacted sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.” Among the alarming findings, the Part A trust fund that finances hospital-based care is set to be bankrupt in 2026. At that point, Medicare providers will face a nine-percent payment cut, which will hurt enrollees and their access to services.  Given Medicare’s deteriorating finances, the E&C proposal to add dental, vision, and hearing benefits to standard Medicare, which could cost $60 billion a year when phased in, is completely irresponsible. Policymakers should be shoring up Medicare to preserve the program for those who are relying upon it, rather than adding to its financial problems and threatening future enrollees’ access to services.   5)     Seniors Already Have Access to Dental, Hearing, and Vision Benefit Through Medicare Advantage In addition to the burden that expanding standard Medicare has on workers and future generations, it is also unnecessary. Seniors who value dental, vision, and hearing benefits can already purchase a Medicare Advantage plan that covers these benefits. Since Medicare Advantage is more efficient than traditional Medicare, these plans often offer these added benefits at no extra cost. In fact, 89 percent of seniors with Medicare Advantage already have preventive dental coverage.  6)     Large Corporate Welfare for Health Insurers  Obamacare delivered massive subsidies to health insurance companies, both those who offered coverage in the exchanges as well as those who participated in the law’s Medicaid expansion. As a result of Obamacare, insurance company profits and stock prices soared, more than doubling the growth of the S&P 500 from 2014 through 2018.  Rather than empowering consumers to decide how to best pay for their health care needs, the E&C proposal would result in hundreds of billions of additional taxpayer subsidies directed straight to insurance company coffers. First, the proposal expands eligibility for premium subsidies to individuals with incomes below 100% of the poverty line from 2022-2024. Second, the proposal creates a new Medicaid program apparently run by insurance companies selected by the HHS Secretary in states that did not adopt Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. Third, the proposal creates a new reinsurance program to pay insurers for the expense of people with high-cost claims. All these subsidies empower the government and insurance company bureaucracies and effectively limit consumer options to only plans approved by the government.  7)     Improper Medicaid Spending Already Exceeds $100 Billion Annually As mentioned above, the E&C proposal would create a Medicaid program in non-Medicaid expansion states. A November 2020 report by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that improper spending in the Medicaid program exceeded $86 billion annually with an improper payment rate above 21%. Had all states been fully audited, the report would have shown an improper payment rate exceeding 25%, with annual improper payments above $100 billion. Most of these improper payments are due to enrollment of people who either are ineligible for benefits or whose eligibility was not properly determined. These estimates were prepared before federal COVID-19 relief legislation prohibited states from receiving higher matching rates if they removed ineligible people from their rolls. Medicaid is already far too large for the government to properly manage, and thus already harms both taxpayers and those truly in need.  8)     Medicaid Needs Reform, Not Expansion Eight years into Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, we know this model fails to help lower-income people access care and improve their health. During the first three years of the expansion, mortality trends worsened in states that expanded Medicaid relative to non-expansion states. Medicaid expansion also led to a surge in emergency room use, much slower ambulance response times, and an increase in opioid abuse.  A study by Harvard, MIT, and Dartmouth economists found that the actual value of the Medicaid program to recipients is only about a quarter of its cost. The big winners from Medicaid expansion are insurance companies that manage the benefit and hospitals that replace charity care with taxpayer payments. Writing recently in the New York Times 
  
  NYT 
 , MIT economist Amy Finkelstein “estimated that 60 percent of government spending to expand Medicaid to new recipients ends up paying for care that the nominally uninsured already receive, courtesy of taxpayer dollars and hospital resources.” Targeted programs to help vulnerable patients, such as low-income pregnant women and children, are much more effective than Medicaid expansion.  9)     Requiring States to Maintain Their Medicaid Expansion Is Likely Unconstitutional The proposed Medicaid expansion program in non-Medicaid expansion states presents expansion states with an incentive to drop their expansion. By dropping their expansion, they would save their share of the cost of the expansion population. People with income below 100% of the poverty line would qualify for the new program and people with income above that level would receive premium subsidies in the exchanges. States would not have to contribute to subsidies for either group. This might induce states that have expanded Medicaid to unwind their expansions. That would be politically problematic for the congressional majority, so they decided to impose a requirement that states maintain their expansions. This requirement is likely unconstitutional. In NFIB v. Sebelius, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal government could not compel states to expand Medicaid by threatening their federal Medicaid funding if they did not adopt the expansion. Therefore, states will likely be able to drop their Medicaid expansion and will not face penalty. And such action will increase the total cost of the program. 10) The Home and Community Based Service Program is Designed for Workers, not People in Need Democratic leaders have largely framed the home and community-based service program as a jobs program. The Wall Street Journal suggested that this is a political effort to increase wages for workers who can be unionized and become an added source of campaign contributions. President Biden originally called for a $400 billion slush fund, but the E&C proposal cost is projected at about half of that, with financing through Medicaid. If the goal is to help those who are truly disadvantaged, the program should directly give them the resources and allow them to choose their care. 11) Massively Increasing Medicaid is the Worst Way to Provide States with Additional Funds The home and community-based service program would be funded with a permanent seven percentage point increase to the percentage that Washington already reimburses state Medicaid expenditures. Under normal economic conditions, Washington finances about 60% of state Medicaid expenditures, with the federal reimbursement being larger in states with lower per capita income. This would increase the percentage that Washington finances of state Medicaid spending to about 67% on average. Such a policy change would significantly increase the already substantial improper Medicaid spending, as states would even have less incentive to ensure Medicaid spending is appropriate. It would pass more of the responsibility from states, which are currently awash in cash, to the federal government, which is running massive budget deficits. Moreover, a flat, across-the-board increase in the federal Medicaid reimbursement percentage helps richer states that have created profligate Medicaid programs at the expense of poorer states and states with more efficient Medicaid programs.  12) Creation of Giant Slush Funds  The E&C proposal contains tens of billions of dollars in slush funds for HHS to distribute, which will likely incite a lobbying bonanza. While many of these grants, programs, and funding appear to have noble purposes, Congress should take time and debate the merit of such funding and ensure a depoliticized process for the awarding any such funds.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/09/10/a-dozen-big-problems-with-energy--commerces-health-care-reconciliation-provisions/,A Dozen Big Problems With Energy & Commerce’s Health Care Reconciliation Provisions
"Rebecca Minkoff is leaning into technology for her spring collection. Rebecca Minkoff is taking a trip to the Metaverse for fashion week, becoming among the first female designers to create NFTs or non-fungible tokens, those controversial works minted on the blockchain and surrounded by a hype bubble. Minkoff, who is celebrating her 20th year in business, this afternoon will launch her spring collection at an event at Spring Studios cohosted by Lady PheOnix.  The designer has always been at the forefront of technology, streaming her fall collection in February on OnlyFans, and embedding her handbags with QR codes before they were widely used.  “As we began to shape the fashion week experience, we wanted to put together a gallery like experience,” Minkoff told me of the invitation-only event this afternoon at Spring Studios.  An NFT of a Rebecca Minkoff look for spring. Together with Yahoo, Minkoff is breaking barriers across fashion, art, and technology by introducing the first of its kind immersive NFT experience and auction for consumers on a global scale.  Minkoff’s collection, called “I Love New York,” is a multi-layered proposition. One layer are the NFTs that the designer will be auctioning on OpenSea tomorrow.  The second layer is the capsule, which beginning on September 12, will be showcased and available on rebeccaminkoff.com for pre-order with Klarna, a global payments and shopping platform offering customers the convenience and payment flexibility they seek. Fashion lovers can shop the “I Love New York” capsule pieces online and pay in four equal, interest-free installments using Klarna.  The Dematerialized, a destination for digital fashion, is minting a select number of digital garments that will be auctioned on Saturday, Minkoff said.  NFTs, which are powered by Lukso, which bills itself as the blockchain for fashion and lifestyle, are collages capturing a surreal environment of models wearing Minkoff’s designs featuring leather, studs, zippers and fringe, and iconic New York landmarks.  In the images, photographed by Cass Bird, a model carries Minkoff’s redesigned Morning After handbag, superimposed on an electrically-charged bridge, the Chrysler Building, Statue of Liberty and New York skyline. There’s even an aerial of the city with the model wearing one of Minkoff’s studded leather jackets. An NFT of a model wearing Rebecca Minkoff in a collage with the New York skyline. “I reimagined and modernized the Morning After bag for a new generation of women, who are as young, hungry and determined as I was when I first moved to New York City two decades ago,” Minkoff said. “The latest version features exaggerated studding, fringe, and zippers, as well as graffiti, which captures the theme of this collection.”  All proceeds will be used to fund a grant for Women Owned Businesses Impacted in New York City by the pandemic. The Female Founder Collective (501c3) will be administering the grant to support the much-needed businesses, Minkoff said, and revenue from NFT resales will continue to benefit the Female Founder Collective due to the NFTs smart contract structure.  “The last 18 months have taken an immeasurable toll on companies across the U.S., but have impacted women and minorities the deepest,” Minkoff said. “In an effort to be innovative as a frontrunner in the industry raising money for charity, this was a new way for us to give back to the female founder community and help benefit their growth and evolution across all industries through grants.”  Minkoff expects the NFTs and digitized fashion on The Dematerialized to bring a new customer into her fold. “The Dematerialized has it’s own audience that’s well versed in technology,” she said. “We partnered with Yahoo to make a 3-D gallery where you can see the NFTs and can link out to the Dematerialized. We see the future of retail and experiential intersecting in a big way. The more you can make retail fun, the better, and also hit a new customer base.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/09/10/rebecca-minkoffs-spring-capsule-and-nfts-could-change-the-way-we-shop-for-fashion/,Rebecca Minkoff’s Spring Capsule And NFTs Could Change How We Shop For Fashion
"Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) proposed a bill Friday to levy a new tax on the booming market for corporate stock buybacks, putting yet another target on Wall Street as Democrats propose a slew of new tax measures to help shore up funds for a $3.5 trillion budget bill facing tough opposition from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, at the Capitol in Washington. The proposal, called the Stock Buyback Accountability Act, would levy a 2% excise tax on the amount corporations spend to buy back their own stock—a common practice that returns funds to shareholders without generally requiring taxes.  In a statement, Wyden said the bill ""ends the preferential [tax] treatment"" for stock buybacks as he railed against corporations for using the tax savings from former President Donald Trumps' Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to fuel near-record stock buybacks during the pandemic. According to the bill, the 2% excise tax would not apply to buybacks used to fund employee pension plans or employee stock plans. In a Monday note to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated U.S. companies are on track to buy back about $800 billion in their own stock this year, suggesting the proposed excise tax could raise about $16 billion annually. Stock buybacks are only the latest target for Democrats as they look to bolster revenues through a slew of proposed tax measures, including newly proposed taxes on derivatives and hedge fund profits, alongside longer-standing proposals to increase income taxes on corporations and ultra-wealthy Americans. CRUCIAL QUOTE  “A few decades ago, a majority of Wall Street capital funded the real economy—wages, machinery, research, new construction, but today, much of that capital is funneled back to wealthy executives in the form of stock buybacks, and only about 15 percent goes to the real economy,"" Brown said in a statement Friday. ""Instead of spending billions buying back stocks and handing out CEO bonuses, it’s past time Wall Street paid its fair share and reinvested more of that capital into the workers and communities who make those profits possible."" SURPRISING FACT Thanks to surging corporate profits ushered in by the Trump tax cuts in 2017, corporations did a record $806 billion in buybacks in 2018, roughly 30% more than the prior record from one year earlier. KEY BACKGROUND This week, Democrats started drafting a massive budget reconciliation package filled with party priorities that didn't make it into a separate bipartisan infrastructure package. Though the bipartisan infrastructure's price tag was trimmed to satisfy GOP lawmakers, the budget resolution bill would use the Senate’s special reconciliation process to allow Democrats to sidestep Republican support and pass the spending bill with just 51 votes instead of the usual 60. That would still require support from all 50 Senate Democrats, including moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), both of whom have voiced opposition to the budget bill's proposed cost. Citing concerns over heightened inflation, Manchin has said he'll support up to $2 trillion in new spending, but only if Democrats can offset the price tag with cost savings and revenues.

"Latavius Murray was released this week by the Saints, but quickly found a new home in Baltimore. ... [+] (Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images) The Baltimore Ravens have added a new stable of veteran running backs to their roster after being hit with a rash of injuries prior to the season. Baltimore has reportedly signed former Saints running back Latavius Murray to their active roster, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The deal is reportedly for one year and worth $2 million. Murray was released by the Saints earlier this week when he reportedly refused to take a paycut on his $2.95 million contract, according to Schefter. Free agent running backs Le’Veon Bell and Devonta Freeman have already been added to Baltimore’s practice roster this week. Murray, Bell and Freeman have all been selected to the Pro Bowl in their NFL careers. All three of the Ravens’ top running backs suffered season-ending injuries in the weeks leading up to the season opener. That included losing J.K. Dobbins to a torn ACL, Justice Hill to a torn Achilles’ and Gus Edwards reportedly tearing his ACL just days before Baltimore’s Week 1 matchup with the Las Vegas Raiders. Baltimore also has running backs Ty’Son Williams and Trenton Cannon on their active roster. Even prior to the season-ending knee injuries to Edwards and All-Pro cornerback Marcus Peters, the Ravens were already one of the teams affected the most by preseason injuries. Given that Murray played throughout training camp with the Saints, he is likely to be the most ready to go compared to Bell and Freeman, and will likely get the starting job out of the gate for the Ravens.

"Chloe Bailey of Chloe X Halle performs during the Billboard Women In Music 2020 event on December ... [+] 10, 2020 | 2020 Billboard Women In Music/Getty Images for Billboard In just a few short years, Chlöe and Halle Bailey have become one of the music industry’s hottest new breakout acts. The Atlanta-bred sisters rose to prominence under Beyoncé’s wing after the Grammy-winning icon noticed their talent in covering songs of hers on YouTube. They signed to her Parkwood Entertainment label and released their debut album The Kids Are Alright in 2018, and impressed audiences and critics alike even further with their 2020 follow-up Ungodly Hour.   Despite the success of Ungodly Hour, Chlöe and Halle have spent the last year laying the groundwork for their respective solo careers. Halle has been away in Europe for nearly all this year filming Disney’s upcoming live-action Little Mermaid movie, while Chlöe has been at home in the States showing off her skills as a solo performer. She made headlines earlier this summer when she gave an unforgettable rendition of Nina Simone’s civil rights classic “Feeling Good” — and while some blasted her for the performance, Simone’s granddaughter herself showered her with praise. “Everyone’s coming at Chlöe Bailey for her performance of my grandmother Nina Simone’s song ‘Feeling Good.’ But what y’all don’t understand is that grandma was a free-spirited woman herself!!” RéAnna Simone Kelly tweeted. “She would’ve loved that performance as much as I do! Relax. Chlöe killed it.” Now, after months of anticipation, Chlöe released her debut solo single, “Have Mercy,” along with an accompanying music video. The song serves as the lead single off her upcoming debut solo album.  Chlöe was lambasted after the “Feeling Good” performance for her seemingly raunchy dance moves. In the “Have Mercy” video, she throws that criticism back in haters’ faces with unabashed confidence and self-assurance in her body as well as her music. The video is a little bit “Wild Side,” a little bit “WAP,” and 100% Chlöe.  Much like Beyoncé and Solange, Chlöe and Halle are seemingly on diverging artistic and creative paths, each with their own unique sounds and personas. Chlöe x Halle is by no means broken up for good, but some time apart to blossom on their own may prove to be the best thing for both sisters’ careers in the long run.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2021/09/10/chles-long-awaited-solo-debut-have-mercy-is-here/,Chlöe’s Long-Awaited Solo Debut ‘Have Mercy’ Is Here
"ARLINGTON, TX - DECEMBER 02: Baker Mayfield #6 of the Oklahoma Sooners looks to pass against the ... [+] TCU Horned Frogs in the first quarter during Big 12 Championship at AT&T Stadium on December 2, 2017 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) After the blockbuster news this summer that Oklahoma and Texas were bolting the Big 12 Conference for the SEC, the other shoe has dropped. The Big 12 voted on Friday to admit Brigham Young, Houston, Cincinnati and Central Florida to the conference. The schools will begin play in the 2023-24 season, according to a release. The Big 12, which currently has 10 schools, could have as many as 14 if the quartet joins before Texas and Oklahoma depart — which could be awkward for many involved. The new Big 12 will now have at last four Texas schools in Texas Tech, Baylor, Texas Christian and Houston. “We are adding four great universities today. It is a good day, by any measure,” Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby told reporters, adding that BYU will join by 2023 while Houston, Cincinnati and Central Florida, all current members of the AAC, would join by July 1, 2024.  ESPN reported “AAC bylaws require schools to give a 27-month notice before they leave and pay a $10 million buyout fee. In that scenario, joining by the 2023 season would be a long shot, but some sources have said it is realistic. An earlier exit — with a higher buyout — is always a possibility.” AAC Commissioner Mike Aresco, whose league recently lost UConn to The Big East, issued the following statement: “Today’s news confirms what we have said all along regarding our status as a power conference. The irony that three of our schools are being asked to take the place of the two marquee schools which are leaving the Big 12 is not lost on us. Our conference was targeted for exceeding expectations in a system that wasn’t designed to accommodate our success. “All three of these institutions have enjoyed unprecedented success as members of The American, as have our remaining schools. Many of our schools have achieved competitive success similar to the departing schools. We have every expectation that the three departing schools will abide by the conference bylaws to ensure an amicable and orderly transition. We wish them continued success in the future. “Our remaining schools are unwavering in their commitment to competing and succeeding at the highest level and we will not allow external factors to put a ceiling on our potential. We remain unified and resolute and will consider all of our options as we move The American into our second decade and beyond.” The news was met with approval from at least some of the existing Big 12 schools. BYU announced it was thrilled by the move. “This is a historic day for BYU Athletics – and for the entire university,” Kevin J Worthen, BYU president, said in a statement. “The BYU mission statement indicates that BYU is a place where ‘a commitment to excellence is expected.’ We strive to meet that requirement in all we do, including our core academic enterprise. Membership in the Big 12 gives us the opportunity to reinforce that commitment for student-athletes, allowing them to compete at the highest level both on and off the field.” The SEC in July voted unanimously to invite Oklahoma and Texas to join effective July 1, 2025, with competition to begin in all sports for the 2025-26 academic year. It remains unclear exactly when they will join but the SEC, but they will each have to pay a $75 million buyout to become the 15th and 16th members of the conference and must give the Big 12 18 months notice before departing. The two schools have combined for 11 national titles and 17 Big 12 crowns, and both rank in the top seven for appearances in the AP Top 25 poll. The shift reunites Texas and Texas A&M in the same league after they haven't played since Texas A&M left the Big 12 for the SEC in 2012.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/10/big-12-conference-votes-to-bring-in-byu-cincinnati-houston-ucf-to-help-offset-losses-of-oklahoma-texas/,"Big 12 Conference Votes To Bring In BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, UCF To Help Offset Losses Of Oklahoma, Texas"
"Despite the United States Tennis Association mandating that spectators provide proof of Covid-19 vaccination to attend the 2021 U.S. Open, players and their teams are not required to be vaccinated, and none of the men who have advanced to the semifinals will confirm if they have been vaccinated or not, though three have either stated flatly they don't plan to get the shot or have raised concerns about the vaccine. Djokovic said in May he hoped being vaccinated would not be mandated because he's ""always believed ... [+] in freedom of choice."" World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has recently declined to answer whether or not he has received the jab, but in April of 2020 stated, ""personally I'm opposed to vaccination, and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel."" In May of this year, Djokovic said he hoped being vaccinated would not be mandated by tennis' various governing bodies because he's ""always believed in freedom of choice."" No. 2 ranked Daniil Medvedev, who advanced to the semifinals Wednesday, declared in February, ""As for me personally, I will not be vaccinated for medical reasons related to vaccines,"" according to RT.com. No. 4 ranked Alexander Zverev, who is making his second straight trip to the semis of the Open, told reporters in April he had not yet been vaccinated and he believes ""everyone should act as they see fit,"" adding ""nowadays it's easy to be misunderstood, whatever you say"" and that the issue had become ""too political for my taste.""  The fourth quarterfinalist, 20-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime, ranked 15th, is not believed to have publicly addressed his vaccination status. Forbes reached out to representatives for Zverev, Medvedev and Auger-Aliassime to find out if they had been vaccinated but has not heard back—we will update the piece if we do.  World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas, who was stunned in the third round of this year's U.S. Open by 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, asserted last month he would refuse to take a Covid-19 vaccine unless it became mandatory. ""I don't see any reason for someone of my age to do it - it hasn't been tested enough, and it has side effects,"" Tsitsipas said at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, without providing any evidence of proven side effects. ""As long as it's not mandatory, everyone can decide for themselves,"" he added. A spokesman for the Greek government, Giannis Oikonomou, refuted Tsitsipas' claims, stating Tsitsipas ""does not have the knowledge and studies to assess the need for vaccinations"" and that Tsitsipas ""has neither the knowledge nor the studies nor the research work that would allow him to form an opinion about it."" Unlike most team sports in North America (the NBA, NFL, MLS and WNBA have also announced the vaccination rates of their players are 90% or higher), a large percentage of tennis pros have pushed back against Covid inoculation. And it hasn't just been on the men's side. Aryna Sabalenka, the No. 2 ranked female player in the world, spoke out against Covid-19 vaccines in March, stating, ""I don't really trust it"" because ""they just make it, like really quick and there wasn't enough time to test it and to see what can happen."" Sabalenka added, ""I don't want my family to take it. If I have to do it, then, of course, I have to do it because our life is a travel life."" She was eliminated from the Open Thursday night by teenage sensation Leylah Fernandez in the women's semifinals. Elina Svitolina, who lost to Fernandez in the quarterfinals earlier this week, said in the spring when she was asked about getting vaccinated, that it ""makes almost, like, no sense to do something that has been tested for such a short period of time.""  50%. A ​spokesperson for the Women's Tennis Association told CNN earlier this month that ""nearly 50%"" of its players are vaccinated, with the spokesperson stating the organization ""believes in and encourages everyone to get a vaccine,"" but the decision to vaccinate was ""a personal decision and one which we respect."" The ATP ​Tour told CNN its vaccination rate is ""just above 50%.""​ In spite of outspoken hesitancy from many notable players, fans aged 12 and above have to prove they have received at least one dose of a vaccine to watch the US Open in person in Flushing Meadows. After her second-round match last week, former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka called the double standard ""bizarre."" She told reporters she does not ""see the point of stalling"" a vaccine mandate for players on tour, ""because we all want to be safe, we all want to continue doing our jobs."" Azarenka stated she respects other player's opinions as long as ""it's not a conspiracy theory,"" adding ""part of the conversation that, really, you need to be knowledgeable to what you're saying is missing in a lot of players."" Asked about Azarenka's comments last week, Medvedev replied, ""I understand why they did it to the fans. So far, it has not been applied to the players. As players, we can just follow the guidelines and rules."" Andy Murray, a three-time grand slam champion, who has confirmed he is vaccinated, said before the start of the Open that ""over the next few months, things are going to probably end up changing quite a bit. I know the conversations with regards to the Australian Open and stuff are already happening."" Murray, who was eliminated by Tsitsipas in the first round of this year's Open, says he is happy he has received his jab and hopes more players choose to get inoculated in the months ahead. ""Ultimately, I guess the reason why all of us are getting vaccinated is to look out for the wider public,"" Murray explained, adding, ""we have a responsibility as players that are traveling across the world to look out for everyone else as well."" Djokovic announced last June that he and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 after he played in a series of exhibition matches he organized, which drew criticism for their lack of safety precautions for players, including a lack of social distancing. In January, Zverev wrote in an Instagram post that 2020 was challenging in part because when he reached his first Grand Slam final (last year’s U.S. Open), both of his parents and his brother were unable to attend because they had contracted the coronavirus. Medvedev was forced to withdraw from the Monte Carlo Masters in April following a positive test. He won only one match in the following two tournaments he entered and acknowledged that the virus had taken a toll on him physically. Medvedev said he was only at ""maybe 70% or 60%"" a month later in May, adding, ""even if I tried to do some physical, I was also not feeling that well, so I couldn't do much.

"To stay competitive global advertising holding companies have been investing in their data ... [+] capabilities making it a part of their core competencies. (Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images for Somerset House) The ad industry has been relying more and more on data to meet the needs of their clients. Over the past five years large advertising holding companies have been acquiring, investing in, or launching big data companies. The aim is to bolster their advanced data and technology capabilities to better compete with Facebook, Google, to meet the needs of their clients and as a part of their core competency when pitching new business accounts. Earlier this year WPP launched Choreograph, a global data company. WPP joins a number of rival holding companies. In 2016, Dentsu had acquired a two-thirds ownership stake in Merkle, a data driven performance marketing agency at an estimated $1.5 billion. In April 2020 Dentsu exercised its option to fully acquire Merkle. In 2018 IPG acquired Acxiom’s data marketing division for $2.3 billion. The following year, Publicis acquired Epsilon, a data-driven marketing agency for $4.4 billion. In the meantime, Omnicom 
  
  OMC 
  has built their own internal media, marketing and planning system called Omni.  With agencies now emphasizing their data proficiency, Jay Pattisall, Principal Analyst at Forrester Research 
  
  FORR 
  notes, “Data is the new oil when it comes to marketing and running a digital/direct business. It’s what fuels meteoric growth from DTC businesses, multi-billion dollar ad businesses at the likes of Google 
  
  GOOG 
 , Facebook and Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
 . For agencies, the capabilities to manage and enrich data into insights for media and messaging is critical to marketing in the age of the customer. Consequently, agencies like Dentsu, IPG, Omnicom, Publicis Groupe and WPP have been building or buying data management and data technology platforms to power their media and creative businesses.” Pattisall adds, “They all fundamentally enrich data and insights for clients’ brands and marketing, but achieve that in different ways suitable to the agency’s structure. At IPG Acxiom and Kinesso create a series of data and audience tools that the IPG agencies can customize to each agency’s proposition. While Omnicom’s Omni platform functions like an agency operating system combining planning and buying tools with asset management and creative tools. Epsilon, Choreograph and M1 are all platforms but also businesses inside the holding company with services attached to them as well.” “Data and audience platforms inside agencies are primarily tools for media planning and buying and most visible in media agencies. But over the last 18 months platforms like Omni, M1, Epsilon People Cloud and Acxiom are branching out into other parts of the holding companies like PR, Healthcare and creative/content. This is a strong signal of deeper integration.” WPP’s Choreograph will enable their clients to use their own privacy compliant first-party data as the use of third-party cookies will soon be discontinued. Choreograph will consist of 700 data and tech experts worldwide from WPP agencies GroupM and Wunderman Thompson. WPP said Choreograph will develop the capabilities required to partner and empower their clients to properly use their first-party data for advertising purposes. This could potentially include overseeing their clients’ first-party data with the goal of expanding sales. Among the core capabilities cited were insights and planning, private identity tools, media optimization, predictive analytics, strategy consulting, tech development and managing data.  Walgreens Boots Alliance is the first Choreograph client. The Japanese based holding company, Dentsu had said their acquisition of Merkle provided the agency with improved analytical skills for first-party data, enhancing their digital media capabilities among other capabilities. Merkle also allows for more data-driven solutions to improve a brand’s return-on-advertising-investment and e-commerce strategies, and for Merkle’s own consulting.  At the time of the acquisition, the U.S. based Merkle had more than 650 global clients, could access 150 marketing databases and managed over 3.7 billion first-party consumer records. Furthermore, the Dentsu acquisition enabled Merkle to expand globally. In July, Dentsu acquired LiveArea, an agency focusing on the customer experience and commerce for $250 million. LiveArea will be folded into Merkle.  IPG’s acquisition of Acxiom gave the holding company access to large sets of anonymized customer data. This enabled IPG to better target consumers with more contextual ad messages used for purchase consideration and purchase preference. Acxiom operates as a standalone unit within IPG and has been integrating within the agency breaking down the existing silos between traditional and digital media. In June 2020, SpotX, a global video ad platform now part of Magnite. announced a partnership with IPG’s Acxiom. With the emergence of data enriched programmatic buying and hyper-targeted addressable advertising, the goal has been to provide greater audience-based buying capabilities by combining data assets The IPG acquisition did not include LiveRamp, a data onboarding company which has become a separate corporation.  The Publicis acquisition of Epsilon will strengthen their efforts as online client data becomes a core competency with ad agencies. Epsilon’s core business is people-based precision marketing. At the time of the acquisition, Epsilon had 9,000 employees, including 3,700 data scientists. 97% of net revenue came from the U.S. Epsilon also has 250 million privacy-protected consumer IDs. Epsilon focus is on media by integrating their data sets with Publicis to develop consumer IDs, audience segmentations, and more optimized and better targeted media buys for clients. With their digital management capabilities. Epsilon enables the agency to offer greater consumer information to help optimize their client’s business strategy. In addition, Publicis global accounts enable Epsilon to expand into other markets. In April, Publicis announced they were enlarging their relationship with Adobe 
  
  ADBE 
  to allow for one-on-one personalization targeting at scale.  In 2018 Omnicom launched Omni, a people-based marketing and insights platform that personalizes consumers across creative, media, customer relationship management (CRM) and other areas. Omni enables clients to plan and buy a media schedule as well as maintain anonymized first-party customer information such as product purchases. The objective is to improve collaboration and produce neutral results fortified by the lone view of the consumer to help clients. Omni taps into several third-party consumer connected databases including Neustar, LiveRamp and Experian to name a few. The use of data does have issues such as cookie cutter outputs. Pattisall says, “The consequence is a sea of digital sameness in which marketing and experiences provide the same benefits and advantages.” On the other hand, marketers want to do the opposite and stand out by requiring agencies to invest in intelligent creativity combining people and platforms.  Privacy can be another issue, Pattisall adds, “Nothing keeps a CEO up at night like the idea of a hack or breach. Clients must take steps to protect their customer’s data and privacy. Third-party providers like Live Ramp, Zeotap, The Trade Desk offer clean rooms that allow brands and their partners the ability to work with first party data with low risk to fidelity. Agencies are also building clean room and data identity solutions. These are good steps in the direction of privacy. But not leveraging their first party data is a bigger risk to clients. As Facebook, Google and Amazon build even higher walls, closed ecosystems firms must use their first party data as the basis for customer and prospect understanding in order to maintain relationships outside of the dictates of “Big Tech”. Well-known media consultant Bill Harvey says, “It’s logical for all agency holding companies to become first class experts at big data, especially now that digital with its obvious direct marketing capabilities has become such a major part of media allocations. At the same time, the deprecation of third-party ID-matching solutions will cause advertisers to up the priority given to collecting the largest possible database of direct consumer relationships, even with people who don’t buy their brands yet. The agencies’ systems will be competing for management of those huge client databases, so they have built them just in time.”  Agencies embracing data comes at a time when many ad tech companies are using big data sets with aspirations of competing or replacing Nielsen in providing audience measurement to be used as the negotiating currency between agencies and programmers.

"getty There might be many reasons for the U.S. to be unhappy with China. But is unhappiness a basis for policy? Or is the point of policy to solve problems and to get better outcomes? A related question: Is China an implacable foe, in which case no effort by the U.S. would ever result in that better outcome? Or is China a modernizing, complicated society, with a nicely performing economy, but with more than its share of problems, all while operating under a single party dictatorship and grappling with the challenges that entails?   If the former, and it is a black or white question, decoupling is arguably reasonable. We are in a zero-sum world in which every advance China makes is inescapably to the detriment of the U.S. As a long-time China hand argues: “The U.S. and China’s Communist Party are strategic and ideological competitors. CEOs have to decide which side they want to help win.” China is making the U.S. unhappy and the U.S. should therefore make them unhappy. Call this Trumpism without Trump. If the latter, and it is many shades of gray, then the point of policy is not to radiate unhappiness but to pursue better outcomes. In this scenario, we would need to be wise enough to disaggregate what we are doing, and apply the right tools against the right problem. As Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it, our relationship with China ""will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, adversarial where it must be."" We can treat the core geopolitical issues of territorial assertion differently than we treat differences in tariffs, and we can continue to sell Coca-Cola and welcome students while we do so.   U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (2nd R), joined by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan ... [+] (R), speaks while facing Yang Jiechi (2nd L), director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission Office, and Wang Yi (L), China's Foreign Minister at the opening session of U.S.-China talks at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage, Alaska on March 18, 2021. In this shades of gray scenario, let me offer three tactics for dealing with China in a time of great power competition. First: Continue to build the positive elements. Take current U.S. exports. I have just published a book, “The Smart Business Guide to China E-Commerce,” which shows how businesses around the world can win in China e-commerce. Indeed, despite the economic turmoil and political friction, U.S. consumer sales in China have never been better. Chinese consumers like U.S. consumer goods, from cosmetics to apparel, for the same reason U.S. consumers do: because Americans make great products and these products help the customer enjoy a better life. Beyond consumer goods, America has a favorite place in China with regards to agricultural products, educational opportunities, and in many other areas. So goal one is to enhance whatever good news there might be. Second: Don’t mimic China’s economic nationalism. China has held an internal debate between economic rationalism and economic nationalism for over 40 years, with nationalism gaining under President Xi Jinping. But this might be as much good news for the U.S. as a competitor. Economic nationalism means China might lurch into unfair trading practices and subsidize certain industries. But it also means China can misallocate resources, take on debt, reward rent-seekers and foster economic inefficiency. China simultaneously produces cutting edge technology and Soviet-style five year production plans. Sometimes these contradictions can take place in the same project, such as with high-speed rail. An engineering marvel—speaking from personal experience—but with at times unclear cost-benefit analysis. China will play to its strength and the U.S. should play to its. The U.S. response to China’s state-directed economy should not be mimicry, but unleashing the creativity and dynamism that makes the U.S. the innovation capital of the world. Third: Let’s do away with the rancor. Friction is a clumsy management tool and has the habit of feeding on itself. Push back when we must, build areas of collaboration where we can, and do it with as many friends and allies as possible. The utility of diplomacy is not to get along with friends, the utility is that it gives us architecture to deal with nations that are not intrinsically friendly. Denigrating China can play to a domestic audience at times, but it can also be corrosive and makes it less likely to attain the desired outcome. I don’t think a country has ever been insulted into agreement. Let’s communicate displeasure when it might lead to a better outcome, but let’s not adopt it as an obligatory operating premise. The ultimate working relationship between China and the U.S. will be defined over the coming years of give and take. By building out the positive aspects of the relationship, by playing to our strengths, and by avoiding gratuitous hostility, the U.S. will be positioned to manage for the best outcome.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/franklavin/2021/09/10/us-china-business-relations-black-and-white-or-many-shades-of-gray/,U.S.-China Business Relations: Black And White Or Many Shades Of Gray?
"VENICE, ITALY - SEPTEMBER 02: Tiffany Haddish attends the red carpet of the movie THE CARD COUNTER ... [+] during the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 02, 2021 in Venice, Italy. (Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) She may be playing a smart and savvy gambler in her new film The Card Counter out in theaters today, but Tiffany Haddish is making very clear what makes her different from her La Linda character, telling me at Forbes, “She likes that life. I do not. I mean, I like to gamble on me. I will bet on me.” As Haddish’s star status continues to rise with more leading film roles, TV hosting jobs and producing work, she has noticed her approach to business matters evolving as her success continues to grow.  “I’m definitely more aggressive when it comes to business, as far as saying like what I want, what I’m going to need to be able to do what I do. I make bigger investments now. It’s funny because when I started learning about the stock market and stuff, I would make like you know I want to buy $50, I want to buy like $25. Now I’m like Ok, let me get $100,000 worth of that! I guess I do gamble in that way with the stocks, but I only invest in what I use or believe in.” Tiffany Haddish stars as La Linda in THE CARD COUNTER, a Focus Features release One area Haddish strongly believes in and is investing both her time and money in is creating more opportunities for her South Central Los Angeles neighborhood by opening a resourceful grocery store, knowing the direct effect that one strategically located business can have on an entire community of people.  “I want to be a grocer,” Haddish says. “I want to grow my community. Grocery stores have thousands and thousands of products in them, right? And when you go to like Home Depot and Michael’s, they teach you how to use their products. Grocery stores never teach you how to use their products and I guess you’re supposed to already know because you’ve been eating all your life, right? But if you grow up in my community, in a food desert, you’re not necessarily going to know.” Haddish goes on to say that she has been reading a lot about financial literacy lately, understanding more and more the power of the dollar. “I’ve been learning about the history of black people when it comes to money and the disparities that we have suffered and what we don’t learn about it and do learn about it and what they’ve done with food and all these different things and I’m like Shucks, how can I get the dollar circulating in the black community a little more? How can I be supporting my community in general in the South Central area, where I live. How can I build it up? And I start seeing them shutting down all these grocery stores and the dollar only circulates in my community for about eight hours. That’s not okay.” Haddish continued sharing her plan with me by saying she will make sure the majority of her vendors are black and minority vendors, which will get the dollar in her community circulating. She also plans on creating financial literacy classes and cooking classes for area residents, knowledge she says has improved her own quality of life and believes it will do the same for others.  “Once I understood how money works, once I learned how to eat better, I became a stronger, more productive human being. And I feel like when you’re a stronger, more productive human being, your family becomes more stronger and productive. When your family is stronger and more productive, the community becomes stronger and more productive. When a community is stronger and more productive, less need for police beating everybody ass. So that’s my way of solving systematic racism - opening a grocery store!” Haddish even has a name already picked out for the grocery store. Diaspora Groceries, which by her own definition means a group of people that have been removed from their native land, which she says is all but the Native Americans in America. “Everyone is coming from somewhere else, has migrated from somewhere else to be here in America. So that’s for everybody. Diaspora Groceries. And I want to get farmers from all over the world. It’s going to be huge, bro! It’s going to build bridges!” Tiffany Haddish volunteering during a community project in Los Angeles in July 2020.  While Haddish has a dedicated vision she plans to see through, there are some obstacles that currently stand in the way of her passionate mission. “The piece of land that I really, really want, the city owns and they’re being a little stingy because they really want it to go to biotechnology and if it goes to biotechnology, it’s removing a lot of people out of the community. So, let me open a grocery store and put apartment buildings on top of it, then we’ll help the housing situation, the health situation and the financial situation. Let me take this piece of land and make it a place that’s beautiful again. And where I want to do is where the very first commercial black-owned bank was. In the community, for the people that’s there. I want it off of Martin Luther King and Buckingham, but we’ll see what happens.” There is no arguing that Haddish knows exactly what she wants out of life, both on and off-screen. She has openly discussed before her difficult childhood and her moments of homelessness before her stand-up comedy and Hollywood career took off. So with all she has gone through to get to this point, Haddish knows exactly what she would say to her former self, the Tiffany Haddish who was once in search of brighter days. “I would say to her go ahead and get it all out now. Get as much rest as you can and write down those dreams and know that you’re going to accomplish all of them.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2021/09/10/tiffany-haddish-looks-to-build-bridges-by-opening-a-south-central-la-grocery-store/,Tiffany Haddish Looks To ‘Build Bridges’ By Opening A South Central LA Grocery Store
"Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters stage a surprise show to reopen iconic DC venue The 9:30 Club  “Who loves the 9:30 Club? I might be biased, but it’s the best f***ing place to play in America.”  Dave Grohl, ambassador of live music’s return, stood drenched and triumphant on his hometown stage as his band the Foo Fighters closed out their surprise show September 10 to re-open the legendary DC venue where they and so many iconic bands got their start. The Foos had delivered nearly three hours of high-octane music and love to a masked, capacity crowd of lucky fans who’d snapped up tickets went they went on sale the day before. But he had one more surprise to share:  I.M.P., owner of 9:30, Merriweather Post Pavilion and The Anthem, among other DC venues, will open a new club next door to the current location that will be an exact replica of the original 9:30 Club, which was located at 930 F Street NW from 1980-96.  “That was our church. That’s where we all played first. That’s where REM played first. That’s where the Chili Peppers played first. That’s where Nirvana played first,” Grohl said. “Well, they’re opening up the old 9:30 Club right next door. Nobody knows that because I’m the first one to tell you right now. And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’re going to see some real magic.” While the new club promises to look just like the original, the formal announcement notes, “it will not have the notorious stench nor the huge and plentiful rats that old-school patrons so fondly recall.” The name, capacity and timeframe for opening the new club will be announced in the coming weeks and months. The announcement of a new DC music hall is particularly joyful given the devastating effects of the pandemic shut-down on independent venues. Last October I.M.P. shuttered the 500-capacity U Street Music Hall, six months after the 10-year anniversary of its opening.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyolson/2021/09/10/dave-grohl-announces-replica-of-dcs-old-930-club-to-open-next-to-current-location/,Dave Grohl Announces Replica Of DC’s Original 9:30 Club To Open Next To Current Location
"Zach LaVine of the Bulls celebrates his Team USA gold medal. Chicago Bulls star Zach LaVine will be bringing a lot into the new NBA season, with training camp set to begin in a little more than two weeks.  He will bring a gold medal—“the right color medal,” he told me— from the Tokyo Olympics, where he averaged 10.6 points and 4.0 assists, to go with 59.0% shooting, off the bench for Team USA. He will bring a batch of new teammates, including last spring’s midseason addition Nikola Vucevic and free-agent pickups Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan. He’ll bring a higher profile, too, coming off his first All-Star appearance and a role in NBA2K22’s special Dew Zone feature, along with a new Mountain Dew ad spot filmed with Zion Williamson.  There’s a lot going LaVine’s way.  But he will also bring some special familiarity with one of the big issues the league already is facing now as it wrestles with the opening of the season, in 40 days: Covid. Months after it appeared that pandemic was behind us, the virus is raging across the country again. LaVine knows well what it can do, having seen his Bulls’ 2020-21 season torpedoed by Covid and being forced to miss 11 games when he contracted it in April.  LaVine was frustrated by the length of his absence. “It is tough because it is bigger than basketball, obviously,” LaVine said recently. “It has been affecting not only the basketball community but the entire world. You just want to be safe at the end of the day. I want my parents, my family to be safe. I think last year gave us a shock because it was unlike any season any of us had ever played. But I think now we do know how to handle it going forward with certain situations—protecting yourself, guys going out of the lineup, main players on your team being out because of Covid. I had it at the end of the season and missed 20-something games and I couldn’t do anything about it.” Losing several players—Lauri Markkanen, Ryan Arcidiacono, Tomas Satoransky, Chandler Hutchison—to Covid protocols early in the year sapped the Bulls of depth and played a big role in the team getting off to just a 4-8 start. They never seemed to fully recover, even after a March deadline trade that brought in star Magic center Nikola Vucevic.  Vucevic and LaVine seemed to have trouble getting on the same page, with neither wanting to dominate the ball over the other. LaVine was too eager to get Vucevic the ball. Vucevic was too eager to show that it was still LaVine’s team. Just 10 games into the Vucevic-LaVine combo, LaVine’s Covid issue struck.  “The familiarity part is hard, it is something to get used to,” LaVine said. “It’s something that, for two players like ourselves that want to make it work and aren’t selfish by any means at all, I think there was a little bit of us not each letting loose a little bit. I think now with training camp, being able to build up in a complete preseason instead of just having, you know, 18-20 games to try to go play with somebody and go after something, I think it will help out a lot more.” Of all the new benefits LaVine has acquired in this offseason, probably the most important one for him is the simplest: time.  I spoke to LaVine from his trailer as he was filming the Mountain Dew commercial with Williamson in Southern California. After a hectic season followed by a grind through the Team USA training camp and the Olympics, LaVine had a bit of a break to allow his body to rest. But, he said, “I am already a little anxious to get back to basketball.” Zach LaVine's rendering for the Dew Zone section of NBA2K's new edition. There is good reason for that. Few teams have had the same overhaul in the last six months that the Bulls have had. Not only is Vucevic on board, but the Bulls brought in point guard Lonzo Ball from New Orleans and pulled off a surprise by adding wing DeMar DeRozan, a 12-year veteran and four-time All-Star who averaged 21.6 points last season.  The Bulls made less splashy acquisitions that should beef up the team’s defense, too: center Tony Bradley, wings Derrick Jones Jr., Troy Brown Jr. and Stanley Johnson, power forward Alize Johnson. Checking his excitement level, LaVine said, “Extremely.” “I think we have a great group of guys and talent going in there,” LaVine said. “Especially when you have high expectations—you want to live up to those. I want to start early from the ground, get everybody on the same page, obviously we have a lot of new players, a lot of new personalities. We have expectations this year, but we have to go out there and show people why we want to go out there and win.” Of course, he and the rest of the NBA—the world in general, in fact—could do with some taming of the global pandemic that has come roaring back in recent weeks. LaVine and the Bulls were battered by the virus last season. But he’s hoping everyone is better prepared to handle it this time around.  “Hopefully, everything gets under control and we can continue to get better with awareness and our safety,” LaVine said. “But at the end of the day, we’re basketball players and we have to be able to adjust. It is what we do.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/seandeveney/2021/09/10/bigger-than-basketball-lavine-eager-for-chicago-bulls-season-but-covid-looms/,"‘Bigger Than Basketball’: Zach LaVine Is Eager For Chicago Bulls’ Season, But Covid Looms"
"This year the NBA Rookie Transition Program (RTP) was held in Las Vegas, where the MGM Resorts ... [+] Summer league was also being held. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) If you want to excel at basketball, you don’t wait until game time to ask, “how does this dribbling and shooting stuff work” or “what’s with the big orange ball?” Similarly, if you want to excel at life, why would you wait for a crisis to happen before talking about and addressing mental health?  Talking about mental health used to be like talking about Fight Club. In the past, many people seemed to treat mental health more like a toilet plunger. Mentioning either may have suggested that something was already going wrong. After all, you typically don’t run out into a party and say, “where’s the plunger, where’s the plunger,” without getting quizzical looks and more questions.  However, in recent years, different people and organizations including the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the NBA Players Association (NBAPA) have been proactively trying to change this narrative. They’ve been trying to emphasize the need to discuss mental health and wellness well before any issues and crises emerge. In fact, the NBA and NBAPA have already integrated such topics into their Rookie Transition Program (RTP). Year-after-year since 1986, the NBA RTP has helped players entering the league for the first time make that giant leap from college and other settings. This year, over 60 players attended the RTP from August 7 to 12, which was held in Las Vegas along with the 2021 MGM Resorts NBA Summer League. If you’ve never heard of the RTP, that’s probably because you’ve never ever come close to making the NBA. The odds of any given basketball player making the NBA may be significantly lower than your odds of being born with 11 fingers or toes. So NBA rookies are already in a super-elite group. But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t like every day people either, albeit on average taller every day people. “Professional athletes are known for the extraordinary things that they do on the court,” NBA Mind Health Director Kensa Gunter, PsyD, CC-AASP explained. “There’s the idea that they are superhuman. Seeing that dominant image might result in the average person not thinking about the players’ lives, not thinking about people navigating relationships and experiencing stress in different ways, not seeing the regular person.” Mental health and wellness weren’t the only topics covered by the RTP. The formal programming also included a question and answer session with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, advice panels with NBA players, and a discussion with Houston Rockets coach Stephen Silas as well as discussions on financial management, financial benefits, career development, the safety of players and their families, and social justice. Nevertheless, Days 2 and 3 of the week covered mental well-being and healthy relationships. This included a session with Gunter, NBPA Mental Health Director William Parham, Ph.D., ABPP, and Phoenix Suns player Cam Johnson.  Pictured here is the Mental Health Panel during the 2021 Las Vegas Summer League Rookie Transition ... [+] Program on August 8, 2021 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Miranda Alam/NBAE via Getty Images) This years session had heightened meaning. Like a gigantic vacuum cleaner, the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has uncovered a lot of the existing mental health challenges that our society has been facing for years. “The pandemic heightened awareness of mental health,” said Gunter. “It made many realize that many different factors can affect mental health and the importance of proactively taking care of mental health.” And while many athletic programs around the country have focused on the body, they haven’t always focused on the head, which hasn’t quite made sense. After all, the head is attached to the body, at least, it should be.  So are fingers to a hand. When considering athletic performance, Parham used the analogy of a hand and how all fingers are needed to make a fist. “The small finger represents physical health and wellness,” he described. “The ring finger is nutrition health and wellness, the middle finger is restorative sleep and rest, the pointer finger is looking at the playbook and going over the game, and the thumb is mental health.” For the NBA and the NBPA, bringing mental health more to the forefront hasn’t been a Covid-19 pandemic-only enterprise. The RTP sessions were only part of a larger movement to bring more attention to and address mental health. Back in April 2018, the NBA launched the Mind Health initiative to bring mental health conversations more to the forefront and help players, staff, youth and fans access mental health professionals and resources.   Parham mentioned some other NBAPA-initiated efforts as well. For example, former NBA player Keyon Dooling, who was a guard in the league from 2000 to 2013, helped put together a 5-point program to meet the mental health needs of the players. This program included creating a directory of licensed mental health professionals, establishing a mental health literacy program, implementing a touchpoint program to check in with players to see how they are doing, building very specific relationships with journalists to help “address this notion of stigma, reframing in narrative of mental health and wellness,” and putting together a podcast to help others hear stories of successfully managing mental health challenges.  During the 2019-2020 season, the NBA further upped their game, so to speak, by implementing a set enhanced mental health guidelines and requirements for all NBA teams to follow. This included ensuring that each team make one to two licensed mental health professionals available to players and put in place a “written action plan” of how to deal with mental health emergencies. Plus, teams had to tell players and staff members how teams would protect their privacy and confidentiality throughout. Moreover, each team had to identify a licensed psychiatrist (M.D. or D.O.) who could assist with any player mental health issues that may emerge. Along the way, NBA players have become more vocal about sharing some of their mental health challenges. For example, as I covered for Forbes back in 2018, Cleveland Cavaliers star forward Kevin Love went public about his experiencing a panic attack during a game and then-Toronto Raptor star swingman DeMar DeRozan revealed his struggles with depression.  In January 2020, the NBA brought Dr. Gunter on board to oversee the NBA’s Mind Health and its network of mental health professionals. She has since helped grow Mind Health across various NBA and WNBA programs. But then along came something called the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted basketball at all levels, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), NBA, and Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) seasons. All of this prompted the NBA in January 2021 to update their mental health guidelines to account for the potentially greater levels of stress and anxiety that players and staff may be facing as a result of the pandemic. This furthered the emphasis of the NBA and NBAPA in being proactive rather than reactive about mental health. “Conversations about mental health and emotional wellness need to be front and center,” Gunter emphasized. “They’re part of overall health. It's OK to not be OK. Sometimes people think if you are performing well, that means everything else is going well.” Someday, for everyone in our society, talking about mental health may become as commonplace as coaches and players talking about learning and practicing basketball. It’s not great idea to wait until you need something to learn about it. After all, a real basketball game is not the time to ask “should I dribble with my mouth or hands”, “when should I punt the ball” or “where the heck is that plunger?” Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/09/10/nba-nbapa-being-proactive-about-mental-health-especially-with-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"NBA, NBAPA Being Proactive About Mental Health, Especially With The Covid-19 Pandemic"
"RH Dallas Gallery Quarter-after-quarter RH 
  
  RH 
  keeps delivering incredible results. It could almost get boring, but it never is.  Gary Friedman’s earnings call should be required listening for every leader or aspiring leader in retail today, not so much to learn about RH but to sit at the feet of an inspiring, retail visionary. More than a brand, more than a retailer, Friedman describes the company he’s built as an “ecosystem of products, services, places and spaces.”  As for the news, RH ended its second quarter 2021 with revenues of $989 million, up 39% over same period last year and up 40% over 2019. Through the first half of 2021, revenues reached $1.9 billion, up 42% from the same period in 2019.  The company’s income performance was even more impressive. Net income reached $357 million in the first six-months of the year, as compared with $100 million in same period 2019. It is also sitting on a pile of cash, with $95 million in free cash flow added in the quarter to total $231 million through the first half of the year. This led RH to adjust its fiscal 2021 outlook to grow revenues between 31% to 33%, upping its prior outlook between 25% to 30%. And it projects adjusted operating margin in the range of 24.9% to 25.5%, over previous expectations of 23.5% to 24.3%. The companies continued strong performance led Cowen’s Max Rahlenko to conclude: “Ultimately, we are impressed with the top-and-bottom line beats given ongoing supply chain and logistics disruptions, as the business is overall operating at peak efficiency with exceptionally strong underlying momentum.” Among the latest announcements were plans to introduce an extended range of product collections to further expand RH’s ecosystem well beyond the $170 billion home furnishings market. These include RH Couture, RH Bespoke, RH Color, RH Antiques and Artifacts, and RH Atelier to be introduced over the next decade.  Friedman envisions a total addressable global market opportunity between $ 7 trillion to $10 trillion, as each element of the RH ecosystem adds to and buttresses the whole.  “A one percent share of the global market represents a $70 to $100 billion opportunity,” he said in a statement. “Our goal to position RH as the arbiter of taste for the home has proven to be both disruptive and lucrative as we continue our quest to build one of the most admired brands in the world.”  To play on the much bigger world stage, it will open its first international Design Gallery in the 73-acre Aynhoe Park country estate near Banbury, a little over an hour’s drive from London. The grand RH England gallery will follow with openings of what’s promised as equally breathtaking gallery experiences in Paris and London.  Becoming that world’s “arbiter of taste” will be aided with the launch of RH Media, described as a “content platform that will celebrate the most innovative and influential leaders who are shaping the world of architecture and design.”  And to connect consumers with the many facets of the RH ecosystem, a new online portal, called the World of RH, will be launching next year. It will invite customers to partake in the full depth and breadth of the brand and its ecosystem.  “Our ecosystem of products, places, services and spaces inspires customers to dream, design, dine, travel and live in a world thoughtfully curated by RH, creating an emotional connection unlike any other brand in the world,” his statement conveyed. Making over its older Legacy Galleries into state-of-art, mammoth-sized Design Galleries will continue, with Chicago, Jacksonville and San Francisco slated to open this fall. All will include hospitality experiences to make them destinations, not just places to buy furniture.  But he also pulled back the originally promised Fall 2021 introduction of RH Contemporary and the opening of the first HR Guesthouse in New York City until spring next year. Further, its Fall Source Book mailing is on hold, all because of uncertainties surrounding the Delta variant and potential sourcing delays it is experiencing in Vietnam. Friedman closed his prepared remarks outlining his overarching ambition to elevate the RH brand and amplify “our core business by adding new revenue streams while disrupting and redefining multiple industries,” including architecture, interior design and landscape architecture.  “Taste can be elusive, and we believe no one is better positioned than RH to create an ecosystem that makes taste inclusive,” he said. “We continue our quest to become one of the most admired brands in the world.” And with that, he went off-script to answer analysts’ questions and then things got really interesting.  As much as Gary Friedman is an astute businessman, he is equal parts philosopher and psychologist. Steve Jobs-like comes immediately to mind.  Like Jobs, he dropped out of college. His wisdom comes not from books but from life experience, starting with folding clothes in a Santa Rosa Gap store. And like Jobs, he learned from ups and downs in his business life.  But unlike Jobs, who grew up in a stable middle-class home, Friedman said his mother suffered from mental illness throughout her life. As a result, his early home life was unstable. He said they lived on food stamps and were evicted multiple times.  It is easy to see how home would play such a large part in Friedman’s professional career, and likewise stores. They must have seemed like magical places where wonderful things could be bought to fulfill one’s dreams, but they were also places he was largely excluded from. Friedman’s 64-year life journey has uniquely primed him to make his RH ecosystem vision a reality and why every retailer can take a lesson from him.  Perhaps the biggest mistake retailers make today is to continue to think that products are its primary business. Products’ relative importance rises in necessity businesses, like grocery, but even there, such retailers depend on a whole lot of discretionary purchases to keep the lights on and doors opened.  The products retailers sell are simply a means to an end for the consumer. That’s why retailers must stay focused on the consumer’s end goal. Even Walmart understands this with its “Save Money. Live Better.” promise. Both are experiential ends customers want.  “First you got to think about how do I create demand [i.e. consumers’ end]. And that’s a big part of the focus. And then, we say how do we fill demand,” he shared.  Friedman instinctively understands how important people’s home life is. And he also understands how difficult it is for them to realize their dreams. Decorating a home is a hard and messy business, too easy and expensive to get wrong. RH sets out to make it easy with products and services to bring each person’s home dreams to life. Since retail is a people-first business, Friedman surrounds himself with smart, positive, problem-solving people. “I try to listen to the people that are way smarter than I am,” he revealed.  While he is the final decision maker, he listens and learns. “I sit here with 20 people for hours and hours going through categories and trends and every detail in our business. We turn over every rock. We gain alignment and clarity. We tend to just debate everything here,” he shared. He pointed to Eri Chaya, the company president, chief creative and merchandising officer, as someone he depends upon to “keep me out of the ditch.” The people around his table are those “who see the answer in every problem, versus those who see the problem in every answer.” And he and his people are always poised for action. “When you’re inventing and innovating, it’s just really stimulating for smart, driven people because they are learning by doing. They are learning by being involved. They are not learning by studying an operational manual.” This action-oriented philosophy is how Jeff Bezos grew Amazon.  And as they learn by doing, Friedman is ready to change course. “I always say we reserve the right to change our minds for better ideas and better thinking.”  Despite the primed-for-action culture Friedman has built, he is not hesitant to wait. “You don’t rush quality. You wait for it,” he said as he announced delays in launching the much anticipated and hoped for RH Contemporary and the New York City RH Guesthouse. Rather than push out newness for the sake of newness, he has chosen to wait till the time feels right. And the time spent waiting is going to result in an even better finish.  “The good news is, we keep making it better. So every season we delay, it gets so much better. So it’s between now and next spring, it’s going to continue to get better,” he shared. While awaiting the newness that effectively has been delayed for two years due to the pandemic and supply chain issues, Friedman has maintained RH’s focus on bettering the core business and its proven best sellers.  “We focus on doing extraordinary and remarkable work. And when we do that, we usually figure out how to monetize it,” he said. That’s a lesson every retailer can learn: “It’s really hard to monetize ordinary and unremarkable.”  No matter what vertical category you sell to or what demographic your customers fall into, every retail can strive to do better than they did before and that much better than the competition.  As Friedman shares, you have to reach for excellence and not settle for just being good enough.  “We have all got to learn to improvise, adapt and overcome at a whole new level. It’s about building new muscles and getting smarter and solving new kinds of problems, and as human beings growing exponentially,” he said. Exponential company growth will follow.   Throughout his most recent earnings call, and other presentations he’s made, Friedman holds the idea of retail management in low regard. “Managers arrange and organize a status quo,” he said. “We don’t even use the word manager in this company. We’re allergic to that word.” While a lot of management goes into designing, stocking and operating each node in the RH ecosystem, that isn’t Friedman’s or his team’s focus.  “Rule number one is vision is everything. We say vision leads the leaders. Leaders have to be willing to destroy today’s reality to create tomorrow’s future,” he believes. “We have to be willing to tear down our very best work to do something exponentially greater and more valuable.” Too much retail today is simply status-quo maintaining. So many formerly great retail brands stopped reaching for and redefining their vision as the times change. They settled into management complacency to maintain the status quo, not reach for the stars. I could make a list and you could too, but one thing is for sure, RH won’t be on it.  “Everybody here is titled a leader, because leadership is about taking people somewhere they have never been, doing something they have never done. And we say leaders have to be comfortable making others uncomfortable because you’re in uncharted waters all the time,” he said. And to guide himself, his team and his company in those uncharted waters, Friedman asks, “Is it directionally right? Is it strategically right? Is it more right than wrong?”  And when the answer is yes, that’s when they all move in one direction together. “Then we get going because that’s when you learn. That’s where you grow and learn exponentially faster than everybody else.” My advice to every retailer is to set RH’s next earnings call on your calendar. Sure, you’ll hear about RH’s next milestones, which promise to be ground breaking. “Our business is ripping. Maybe somebody else has 40% two-year growth, not many. I don’t think anybody is going to have the two-year growth that we are going to report in third and fourth quarters,” he promised.  But more importantly, you’ll be able to get inside a great retail visionary’s head, be inspired and bring back some of that vision to your business, no matter how small, to make it bigger, better and more remarkable.  Remember, he started as a college dropout folding clothes on a Gap sales floor, not an MBA in the executive office.

"The Walmart/Instacart deal is the latest in a world where the walls between brick-and-mortar and ... [+] online retail are coming down, including in food and beverage.  When it comes to price, Walmart has always delivered, but consumers these days want more than low cost and many choices. In the age of Amazon and a pandemic where curbside and delivery became “essential,” consumers want convenience. As part of its effort to provide quick, cheap delivery and compete with Amazon, Walmart recently expanded an alliance with Instacart. So far it’s a relatively narrow partnership, but it’s a big deal, because it involves big players in the growing delivery space. And it’s only a small part of Walmart’s expansion beyond bricks to clicks. As first reported in The Wall Street Journal, Walmart expanded a delivery pilot with Instacart to include parts of New York City, where Walmart doesn’t have stores. The same-day-delivery pilot started last year in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and has grown to include Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Manhattan isn’t included. Convenience is becoming the new king in retail amid Covid-19 – or maybe it always was, although now it’s being defined differently. Retailers have to be where the customer wants – and that increasingly means delivery. The Walmart/Instacart deal is the latest in a world where the walls between brick-and-mortar and online retail are coming down, including in food and beverage. Amazon, of course, bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Now delivery companies are taking the Amazon approach. DoorDash is opening brick-and-mortar DashMart stores to sell groceries and other products typical in convenience stores, according to The Food Institute. Companies are refining and sometimes “redefining” their business models to better compete with Amazon. Walmart is at the forefront of those vying with Amazon, leveraging strong supply lines and adding speed and service. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in testimony before a House committee in July described “new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart” that “enable traditionally physical stores to put up a full online store almost instantaneously and to deliver products directly to customers in new and innovative ways.” He also cited Walmart, which he called “a company more than twice Amazon’s size” whose online sales grew 74% in the first quarter, during the peak of the pandemic. Sure, Bezos was testifying regarding anti-trust, but there was some truth there: Walmart is looking beyond brick-and-mortar just as Amazon looked beyond online. “Customers are increasingly flocking to services invented by other stores that Amazon still can’t match at the scale of other large companies, like curbside pickup and in-store returns,” Bezos said. If Amazon is keenly aware of brick-and-mortar retailers growing e-commerce, Walmart is not simply waiting and watching. Walmart, which has 10,500 stores and clubs and employs 2.2 million (including nearly 1.6 million in the United States), has been investing in and growing e-commerce for years—and is upping the pace. Walmart.com attracts 100 million unique visitors a month and growing, according to comScore. The company offers online grocery pick up the same day and shipping the next day. It rolled out apps from Walmart Pay to Mobile Express Returns, “while reimagining how digital and physical shopping work together,” as the company says.  Walmart’s newest e-commerce fulfillment centers can ship millions of items, giving it a leg up on logistics.  While Walmart grows online, restaurants with their own delivery service face challenges – and successes – in delivering product and profit. Domino’s recently grew profit margins to 24.5 percent at company-owned stores, largely by having fewer employees amid a labor shortage, while increasing wages, according to QSR magazine. The magazine said Domino’s grew comps and implemented “modest menu price and delivery fee increases,” while the Domino’s CEO Richard E. Allison, Jr. said it has been adding “a minute or two” to average delivery time. Still, Domino’s lives in a world where minutes matter. It’s using GPS software to increase speed and artificial intelligence to predict sales, matching employees with demand. And it’s seeing what QSR calls “the comeback of carryout” as the Covid-19 pandemic recedes from its peak. While groceries are essential, delivery is too. And companies need to comply with new regulations, ... [+] as well as provide efficient service. As delivery becomes essential far beyond pizza, government is getting involved in monitoring delivery services. Big cities like New York City and San Francisco capped delivery fees, putting price pressure on delivery companies, making it tougher to turn a profit as demand soars. The City of Chicago in late August filed a lawsuit against DoorDash and Grubhub, accusing both of charging high fees and deceptive practices, claims that both companies said are “baseless.” Regardless of the outcome, delivery is growing in demand and scrutiny. While groceries are essential, delivery is too. And companies need to comply with new regulations, as well as provide efficient service. Delivery is difficult, leading companies like Walmart to test out various strategies. Walmart bought Jet.com in 2016, using it to deliver in New York City, where it discontinued that arrangement four years later, according to Grocery Dive. But Walmart has been growing grocery and online sales, as it focuses on delivery. Walmart in its August earnings call said second quarter grocery and e-commerce sales grew 6%, and grocery is helping drive overall growth. Part of it is the pandemic and a shift in shopping patterns, but Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company is shifting to “more of a digital-first mindset.” When Walmart talks about “digital first,” that’s a big deal. The company in September launched Walmart+, widely seen as Walmart’s answer to Amazon Prime. Shoppers who pay $98 a year get unlimited free deliveries on orders over $35 as well as fuel discounts and mobile scan-and-go. Walmart itself is getting into the delivery business, helping companies that want to outsource delivery. The company said it will provide its delivery platform, Walmart GoLocal, to other companies.  “We’ve worked hard to develop a reliable last mile delivery program for our customers,” Tom Ward, senior vice president, last mile, Walmart U.S., said. He described Walmart GoLocal as designed for “merchants of all sizes and categories so they can focus on doing what they do best, leaving delivery speed and efficiency to us.” Some other delivery services are expanding rapidly. Grocery delivery company Shipt, owned by Target, recently announced its “biggest expansion in three years,” adding nearly 1,000 stores and more than 2 million households that had been outside its coverage area. ""Shipt has launched one city at a time or rolled out a new retail partner nationwide,” said Bridget Fruit, Shipt’s Chief Operating Officer, in a written statement, adding this “coast to coast expansion is unlike anything we've done before.” The expansion will help about 40 of Shipt's partners reach new customers, including 200 additional CVS locations. The demand is driving expansion of services as well as partnerships. If Walmart’s deal with Instacart is part of this brave new delivery world, a lot has been going on in delivery. DoorDash had one of the nation’s biggest IPOs in 2020. Uber acquired Postmates and is seeking to grow by launching a grocery delivery business and piloting same-day delivery with Costco. Meanwhile, Starbucks has a deal with Uber Eats and Taco Bell, and KFC teamed with Grubhub as Instacart grows by not only one individual customer, but one big partnership, at a time. Instacart, which already partners with retailers such as Kroger, Target, Albertsons and Aldi, is now living in Walmart’s world – or vice versa.  So who will win the delivery wars? It could be Amazon, Walmart, Instacart, other delivery services, the consumer or all of the above. However it works out, companies seeking to deliver sales and profits will have to solve the delivery dilemma in a world where convenience, as well as cost, is king.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/louisbiscotti/2021/09/10/walmart-teams-with-instacart-in-war-with-amazon/,Walmart Teams With Instacart In War With Amazon
"The distressing circumstances surrounding evacuation of U.S. personnel from Afghanistan have spawned hundreds of post-mortems purporting to explain what went wrong with U.S. strategy. One source of recriminations has been the combat gear left behind by U.S. forces. Much of that gear was “demilitarized”—rendered inoperable—before the last American troops departed. Nonetheless, there will likely be a continuing narrative among critics that Washington’s retreat has resulted in arming America’s enemies. An M1A2 Abrams tank at the Army's National Training Center in June. The tank is proving popular with ... [+] front-line countries from Poland to Taiwan.  The implication of that narrative is that introducing advanced weapons into threatened nations runs the risk of backfiring, ultimately undermining U.S. interests. No doubt about it, the danger exists. In the aftermath of the Afghan collapse, though, Washington has a more pressing problem to deal with: its credibility. This arguably sets up a counter-narrative as far as weapons transfers are concerned, which I will lay out below. Afghanistan isn’t the first time in recent history that the U.S. has given up on a fight and left locals in the lurch. The best-known instance is the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam, which culminated in the traumatic fall of Saigon in 1975. Only eight years later, under very different circumstances, 241 American military personnel, mostly Marines, were killed in suicide bombings of their Beirut barracks. President Reagan said at first that U.S. forces would continue to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force, but within months he ordered U.S. troops out of Lebanon and the peacekeeping effort quickly collapsed. Ten years after that, 18 American soldiers were killed and 73 were wounded in the battle of Mogadishu; that setback too led to a quick decision by President Clinton to get U.S. forces out of Somalia—followed shortly thereafter by the collapse of United Nations relief efforts in the war-torn country. So it wasn’t just a cheap shot when China warned Taiwan in the aftermath of the Afghanistan retreat that America could not be counted on to defend the island nation in a future conflict. An editorial in the pro-Beijing Global Times reminded readers of President Trump’s precipitous pullout of support for Kurdish freedom fighters in Syria. Whether Washington likes it or not, the rest of the world is connecting the dots of recent history to raise doubts about American resolve when confronted with military reverses. Even the 20-year commitment of U.S. troops to the defense of Afghanistan is sometimes spun as a lack of courage on the part of leaders who knew the war was lost but were reluctant to accept the political fallout from leaving. Fortunately, Washington has a ready response to doubts about U.S. reliability that can allay fears in foreign capitals without necessarily requiring the deployment of U.S. forces. That response is to arm countries so they can defend themselves. This actually has been a favored political option for many years when the American people began to weary of casualties in foreign wars—for instance in President Nixon’s 1969 policy of “Vietnamization.” That approach gave South Vietnam the wherewithal to defend itself if it could summon the necessary discipline; America could hardly be faulted for its failure to do so. Arming threatened overseas friends as an alternative to sending U.S. forces may be the best option that U.S. political culture can sustain in some circumstances. For instance, Washington has resisted committing itself to the defense of Taiwan if China invades for fear of how Beijing might react, but it has taken the lead in arming Taiwan’s military against incursions. In recent years, the U.S. has agreed to sell Taipei additional F-16 fighters in the upgraded Viper configuration, reconnaissance pods to better track the movement of Chinese naval forces, Abrams tanks, Stinger air-defense missiles and other gear. Washington would likely respond vigorously to any Chinese aggression against the island, but for those in Taiwan who are entertaining doubts, the availability of new U.S. weapons has to be comforting. A further step such as selling the F-35 fighter might provide additional reassurance, especially the vertical-takeoff variant used by the Marine Corps that does not require use of vulnerable runways. Poland is another frontline state that has been acquiring advanced U.S. weapons, most notably the Patriot air-defense system, Abrams tank and F-35 fighter. The U.S. has been gradually expanding its military presence in Poland, which looks to be in greater danger given recent political developments in neighboring Belarus, but with or without American troops, a well-armed Polish military equipped with the latest U.S. warfighting gear is a powerful deterrent to aggression. And then there is the United Arab Emirates, which faces potential danger from Iran across the Persian Gulf; it too has been given the go-ahead to acquire F-35 fighters. Such sales have multiple benefits for the U.S. in terms of creating domestic jobs and promoting interoperability among militaries. In the aftermath of America’s Afghanistan departure, they also help reassure key friends that even if America’s future dependability can’t be proven, local militaries have some reasonable chance of defeating attackers on their own. Several major weapons makers contribute to my think tank.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/09/10/why-americas-retreat-from-afghanistan-reinforces-the-case-for-foreign-arms-sales/,Why America’s Retreat From Afghanistan Reinforces The Case For Foreign Arms Sales
"NEWARK, NEW JERSEY - AUGUST 26: Taylor Swift attends the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential ... [+] Center on August 26, 2019 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for MTV) Last week, Olivia Rodrigo returned to the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart with her debut full-length Sour, which bounced back to No. 1 thanks to an especially notable sales frame. The title, which has already earned several turns atop the tally, was a bestseller once again thanks to the fact it was finally released on vinyl after months of the musician promoting the format. As it reached the Billboard 200's summit once again, Sour made history by racking up the second-most impressive vinyl sales week in U.S. history. That fact may come as something of a surprise to those who aren't closely following the rebirth of the LP, as Rodrigo's fans are largely Gen Z. Until recently, it was assumed that only older audiences purchased vinyl records, but 2021 has shown that nothing is further from the truth. In just the past few months, the records for the largest vinyl sales weeks in U.S. history have been rewritten over and over, with young superstars proving they can convince their legions of followers to pay a premium to own their latest compositions on wax. Back in June, Taylor Swift earned the largest sales frame ever for a vinyl album when her full-length Evermore registered a whopping 102,000 copies sold in just seven days, making it the first title to hit a six-digit sum in such a short span of time. Even more impressively, Evermore had already been out for six months and had already ruled the Billboard 200, but months of preorders and a dedicated fan base helped it make history nonetheless. Just a month ago, Billie Eilish's sophomore album Happier Than Ever debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, thanks in part to the 73,000 vinyl copies that were sold in its debut frame. That stood as the second-largest sales frame in the format's history (at least since MRC Data, formerly Nielsen, began tracking purchases electronically in the '90s) until just last week, when Rodrigo's Sour bested it by 3,000 LPs. Before 2021 rolled around, the record for the largest vinyl sales week in U.S. history was owned by Jack White's Lazaretto, which moved the benchmark up to 40,000 back in 2014. Before that, Pearl Jam's Vitalogy, released in 1994, held that title, with 34,000 LPs sold in one tracking frame. The market for vinyl albums used to be almost exclusively older men who preferred rock, as is evidenced by the titles that were, for a time, the most successful on the format. Now, things have changed, as women are redefining what rock and pop sound like, and their followers are snapping up everything they release on what was, for a long time, thought to be a dead format.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/10/taylor-olivia-and-billie-young-female-musicians-have-been-busy-rewriting-vinyl-history/,"Taylor, Olivia And Billie: Young Female Musicians Have Been Busy Rewriting Vinyl History"
"BORDEAUX, FRANCE - JUNE 21: An array of red wines on show at Vinexpo on June 20, 2007 in Bordeaux, ... [+] France. The annual event draws major producers, tasters and purchasers from all over the world. (Photo by Pascal Parrot/Getty Images) Back in 1855 a group of Bordeaux merchants at an Exhibition in Paris decided to make some sense of the myriad estate vineyards by classifying them according to which wines consistently sold for the highest prices within the industry. That classification, which ranked wines from premier crus (first growths) to Cinquième crus (fifth growths). Sixty-two among 2,000 vineyards were listed, and, with only a few shufflings over rankings and the addition of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild to the premier crus later on, the top wines have remained the same, still bringing top dollar in the market, along with several great Burdgundies like those from the Romanée-Conti estates.  But a just published on-line report by Liv-ex, a London-based global marketplace for the wine trade, where 550 fine wine businesses from around the world buy and sell wine, indicates that several California wines now rank among the top. First published in 2009, the Liv-ex Classification has been updated every two years to reflect the changing conditions of the market, using the 1855 methodology of prices to determine a hierarchy. California wines including Harlan Estate, Colgin, Scarecrow and Screaming Eagle all placed in the first tier, with some rising stars like Opus One Overture,  Realm Cellars’ The Bard, Spottswoode’s Cabernet Sauvignon and Ulysses’ Cabernet Sauvignon. Liv-ex’s Director and Head of Sales, Anthony Maxwell.       To put the report’s findings in perspective, I interviewed Liv-ex’s Director and Head of Sales, Anthony Maxwell. Born in South Africa and brought up in France before moving to the UK when a teenager, Maxwell worked for the Foreign Office in Geneva and the International Federation of Wines and Spirits in Paris. He then worked for John Armit Wines for eight years, running their trading department and private client sales department before joining Liv-ex in 2005.   Why do you think this shift away from French (Bordeaux / Burgundy) wines is taking place? Does Covid have anything to do with it? There are probably two reasons for this shift. The first is that the definition of “fine wine” is now broader than it once was. It is no longer limited to just Bordeaux or just French wines, and as a result this has considerably opened up the world of fine wine, especially when other regions can match the French in terms of quality.  Another reason is due to buyers searching for greater value and in doing so they are looking to these other regions. That being said, French wines continue to be hugely popular. In some cases, buyers have shifted to Champagne and the Rhône in search of value. Even within Burgundy and Bordeaux themselves, buyers are looking at up-and-coming producers and AOCs where prices aren’t as high.  Many of the trends in the Classification pre-date Covid-19. However, this move towards a move diverse market was certainly accelerated.    A John Kapon, CEO of Acker Merrall & Condit Companies poses for photography with a full case of the ...

Pictured at Grand Club, Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, Wan Chai. 14SEP11 (Photo by Sam Tsang/South China Morning Post via Getty Images) re some French wines pricing themselves out of the market? I don’t think this is necessarily the case. As our Power 100 rankings show, wines from France still dominate and continue to make up the majority of the most powerful brands in the fine wine market.  When looking at the components of the Liv-ex 1000 index, the Bordeaux 500 index, which reflects the price movement of 500 leading wines from the region, is up 5.05% year-to-date and 7.7% over a one-year period. The Burgundy 150, Champagne 50 and Rhône 100 have also seen impressive gains over the same periods too.  Prices for French wines are still rising, but wines from other regions are also rising and faster too.       On a positive note, the Classification does highlight that value that still exists in classic French regions. You can still buy Classed Growth Bordeaux for hundreds of pounds, not thousands. There is also some Burgundy that doesn’t cost thousands of pounds per bottle. Champagne and the Rhône continue to provide excellent value among some of their greatest domains and terroirs too.  What are the criteria for inclusion? In order to qualify for the ranking, a wine must have traded on Liv-ex between 1st July 2020 and 30th June 2021 in either a 75cl or 150cl bottle format. Standard in Bond, Standard En Primeur and Duty Paid trades were all considered, except for Burgundy, Champagne, Australia and the USA where special trades were also permitted. Five or more vintages of the wine must have traded during this period and the wine must have traded 15 or more times.       Once a wine qualified for inclusion in the rankings, the average trade price per 12 bottle case was calculated and the wine would be assigned to tier with the relevant price band.  The price bands are updated every two years to reflect the changing conditions of the market. This year we adjusted our price bands in accordance with the performance of the Liv-ex 1000 index. Between May 2019 (when we last updated our classification) and June 2021, the Liv-ex 1000 rose by 6.36% and the price bands for each tier were adjusted to reflect this. The lowest price bracket was for the 5th tier (between £306 and £382 per 12×75) and the highest was the 1st tier (£3,060 and above).    What longer term trend do you see emerging from this report? This year’s classification really cements the secondary market trends we have highlighted on numerous occasions over the past year.  The first is Bordeaux’s declining share of secondary market trade, which is mirrored in the composition of the classification over time. In 2019, Bordeaux accounted for 37% of the classification, this year it makes up just 28.6%. The diversification of the market is another, as more wines from each country traded. For example, in 2019 U.S. wines only appeared in the top two tiers, but this year they’re spread across four. The same can be said for Bordeaux, Tuscany, Piedmont and the Rhône, which had wines across all five tiers. Burgundy was found across four and Portugal & Australia across three. No doubt as prices for well-known regions and brands continue to rise, buyers will continue to explore up-and-coming regions in search of greater value. This trend is likely to continue.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmariani/2021/09/10/report-suggests-that-bordeaux-and-burgundy-losing-their-cachet-as-the-worlds-finest-wines/,Report Suggests That Bordeaux And Burgundy Losing Their Cachet As The World’s Finest Wines
"US President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, in Dearborn, ... [+] Michigan on May 18, 2021. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) In a meeting earlier this week, the CEO of a company I plan to write about in the coming days commented on the lack of continuity in U.S. government when it comes to energy policy, with new presidential administrations coming to power every 4 to 8 years. He compared that to the situation in China, whose communist government is able to execute plans across decades, not just for energy but across all elements of its economy and culture. It wasn’t an endorsement of either system; just a statement of fact, one that presents a challenge that every U.S. president must meet. This feature of the American system is quite relevant where energy policy is concerned today, since it emphasizes the requirement for U.S. presidents to maintain public support for their programs in order to put them in place, and even more to the point, to ensure that they continue into succeeding presidential terms. Where energy is concerned current U.S. President Joe Biden finds himself struggling to find ways to try to contain the costs of current energy generating sources as he attempts to force their replacement by new ones. This is not just about gasoline prices at the pump, although they certainly represent a key piece of this puzzle. It’s also about the price for natural gas, which opened Friday at a 12-year high above $5 per Mmbtu. With crude prices also firming up on Friday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released another very bullish drawdown in inventories of not just crude but also refined products, Biden finds himself in a position in which, fairly or not, his policies could end up being blamed by consumers for rising energy costs. The President famously made his concerns about rising energy costs public in August when he urged OPEC+ countries to raise their own production levels to slow rising crudes prices. The oil cartel rejected this illogical request, but has continued to execute on its already-in-place plan to add 400,000 barrels of oil per day onto the global market at the first of each month.  That increased level of production, along with ongoing COVID-related demand concerns and other factors, has seemed to calm oil markets to an extent over the last 30 days, although still at higher prices than Biden would like. The latest data from Gasbuddy.com indicates that the average price per gallon of regular gasoline - which is largely driven by oil prices - remains at around $3.17, more than a dollar per gallon higher than it was on Election Day 2020.  That higher cost of gasoline at the pump has played a significant role in the major inflation issues Biden faces, and now the higher price for natural gas threatens to exacerbate that problem. Most are aware by now of the major role natural gas plays in the U.S. electric power grid, with EIA’s most current data indicating that it accounts for over 40% of the nation’s power supply. The lower gas prices over the last decade have helped to support lower consumer utility bills, but the recent doubling in the price is now coming to be reflected in fuel costs passed through by those same electricity providers.  Similar to the cost of gasoline and diesel in transportation, higher electricity costs will also place upwards price pressure on all manner of consumer goods. The role natural gas plays as a feedstock for fertilizer production will also put price pressure on food and other grocery store items, as will its role as a feedstock for plastics. Another reason for the rising price of natural gas has been the growing international demand for U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Along with Australia and Qatar, the United States now ranks among the three largest LNG exporting countries on the planet. The EIA reported recently that U.S. LNG exports achieved all-time record highs during the first half of 2021. That’s a major market for U.S. natural gas that didn’t even exist as recently as five years ago, but now takes a significant cut of domestic production. Biden and his increasingly authoritarian policy moves stand to be blamed for these rising costs to consumers for the simple fact that he is the current occupant of the White House. As consumers link Biden’s policy initiatives to the higher prices they are paying now for literally every item they purchase, Biden’s ability to sustain critical popular support for those policies - and the needed votes in congress in favor of his legislative proposals - will likely become increasingly difficult. Is it fair to blame Biden for the price of gasoline and natural gas? Maybe, maybe not, but that doesn’t matter. Regardless of any notion of fairness, it is the reality he and his administration now face. If he can’t find a way to cope with that reality, many of his policy initiatives will almost certainly fail.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/09/10/gasoline-and-gas-prices-give-biden-headaches-in-his-green-new-deal-push/,Gasoline And Gas Prices Give Biden Headaches In His Green New Deal Push

There’s more talk about Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks than there is about either New York team reaching postseason play.  The Yankees enter the series with a six-game losing streak, leaving them third in the American League East, 10 games behind the front-running Tampa Bay Rays and just a half-game ahead of the surging Toronto Blue Jays for the AL’s second wild-card spot. The Oakland Athletics sit just two games behind.  As for the Mets, they are also in third place, five games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East and also five games behind in their bid to become a wild-card team — with four clubs ahead of them in a crowded wild-card fight.  The Mets, who will host the Subway Series, slipped under .500 Thursday with a 3-2 loss to the lowly Miami Marlins, who also beat them by one run with a late-inning rally the previous night.  With both clubs floundering, The tabloid New York Post came up with a telling two-word headline on the back page of its Friday edition: TRAIN WRECKS.  For teams ranked near the top in player payroll, their performances perplexed ownership that hoped big bucks would bring big results.  The Yankees, still owned by the family of the late George Steinbrenner, rank second among the 30 teams, according to Spotrac, with a payroll of $203,341,300. The Mets, in their first year under billionaire hedge-fund magnate Steve Cohen, are third at $199,497,745.  Though injured pitching ace Jacob deGrom will miss the Subway Series this weekend, the Mets hope he ... [+] returns before the end of the season. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) To be fair, injuries have idled key players on both rosters, with two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom unable to pitch for the Mets since July 7 and sidekick Noah Syndergaard still sidelined while recuperating from Tommy John surgery.  Center-fielder Brandon Nimmo, catcher Thomas Nido, and reliever Robert Gsellman will also miss the inter-league series.  The Yankees are without starting pitchers Gerrit Cole, Jameson Taillon, Domingo German, and Luis Severino plus relievers Zack Britton, Darren O’Day, and Jonathan Loaisiga. Cole, who had been scheduled to pitch the Subway Series finale Sunday, is due back next week.  Even the able-bodied athletes available to play this weekend have been struggling.  Yankees outfielder Joey Gallo, acquired from the Texas Rangers at the trade deadline, ranks among American League leaders with 31 home runs but has been mired in a prolonged slump since donning pinstripes. Anthony Rizzo, acquired from the Chicago Cubs at the same time, hasn’t been much better.  Neither have catcher Gary Sanchez nor shortstop Gleyber Torres, who is danger of losing his job to rookie Andrew Velasquez, a Bronx native who made a strong first impression.  On the plus side, Giancarlo Stanton practically carried the club with a huge power display that helped the Yankees win 13 in a row last month. Aaron Judge, another towering slugger, has also hit well but not with the same power he showed during his 52-homer rookie season in 2018.  The Yankees are also awaiting the awakening of two-time batting champion DJ LeMahieu, who turned into a .267 hitter this season.  Yankees infielder DJ LeMahieu took a .305 career average into this season but has struggled to hit ... [+] .270. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) The Mets got a lift from trade deadline acquisition Javy Baez, whose speed, power, and infield defense at several positions offset his propensity for frequent strikeouts. He shares the right side of the infield with Pete Alonso, who ranks among the league leaders in home runs.  Another newcomer, Francisco Lindor, is still struggling to master National League pitchers – even after signing a 10-year, $341 million contract extension that makes him the highest-paid player in team history.  Neither he nor Michael Conforto, a free agent after this season, has managed to lift his average above .230. Jeff McNeil, who started the season with a lifetime mark of .319, has struggled too, opening the way for productive bench players Kevin Pillar and Jonathan Villar.  Thanks mainly to solid pitching, the Mets held first place for most of the first four months. But a nine-game August winning streak by the Atlanta Braves knocked the Mets from their perch.  The Braves host the Mets for the final three games of the season at Truist Park. But the Mets have to get past the Yankees first.  Twenty years ago, the Mets beat the Braves, 4-3, in the first game played in New York after a week-long hiatus imposed by the 9/11 attacks. Hall of Famer Mike Piazza, whose eighth-inning home run was the decisive blow, will be among 15 former Mets players and coaches from the 2001 team returning for Saturday’s CitiField ceremonies. Many of them, along with the current Mets in uniform, will wear first responder caps.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2021/09/10/slumping-new-york-clubs-could-have-last-hurrah-of-2021-in-subway-series/,Slumping New York Yankees And Mets Could Have Last Hurrah Of 2021 In Subway Series
"On the evening of September 10, 2001, Forbes was hosting its annual Media Ride, a cruise around Manhattan for New York City’s top editors and journalists. As the vessel neared the corner of lower Manhattan, with the impressively lit Twin Towers in the background, guests overwhelmed the photographer with requests for photos of themselves in front of the iconic scene. It was utterly inconceivable that within hours those photos of a happy event would take on an indescribable poignancy and sadness. We all have vivid memories of that terrible day. I was coming into New York by car from New Jersey that morning when news came that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers. This was most likely the result of an idiot operator of a small, private aircraft getting too close to the structure, was my initial thought. There wasn’t even a thick fog like that, which many years prior to 9/11, had accounted for a plane’s crashing into the Empire State Building. We were on the NJ Turnpike extension that leads to the Holland Tunnel. Suddenly there was a sight that my mind couldn’t believe: a large, seemingly black (because of the sunlight) aircraft heading straight into the South Tower. It crashed, and seconds later came the fiery explosion. Keith J. Kelly with his wife, Pat, aboard The Highlander, the Forbes yacht, evening of Sept. 10, Keith's birthday, on the Hudson. About 12 hours before the towers fell.  There would be no going to the office that day. As the horrifying events of that September 11 unfolded, everyone knew things would never be the same, that the trajectory of our nation’s history would be profoundly altered. Until that day, a happiness had still lingered from our total victory little more than a decade before in the 40-plus-year Cold War. A much publicized essay in 1989, “The End of History,” summed up the belief that the values of democracy and freedom had forever triumphed. A more appropriate reaction would have been to recall an exchange in 1972 with China’s premier Zhou Enlai. When asked about the impact of the French Revolution, which had taken place nearly two centuries before, Zhou replied, “Too early to say.” No one could have foreseen on September 11, 2001 and in the days following that the rulers of Afghanistan, who had provided a safe haven and support to the perpetrators of these attacks and who weeks later would be forcibly removed from power by our armed forces with assistance from numerous allies, would be celebrating the 20th anniversary of that infamous day in total triumph. Their flag now dominates our abandoned embassy in Kabul. They possess tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. military equipment. And they hold in their blood-soaked hands the fate of hundreds of Americans and thousands of our Afghan partners whom we didn’t evacuate.  Indeed, who could have imagined that we would be involved in long wars in the Middle East and in Central Asia? For now, U.S. credibility is in tatters. Our NATO allies and other friends, who themselves have suffered more than 1,000 dead in this war, are stupefied and angry. When the U.S. decided to pull out of Afghanistan, we didn’t consult them, even though they had several thousand troops on the ground there. Our adversaries are confirmed in their conviction that the U.S. is in terminal decline. We should not, however, mark this day with a sense of despair. Osama bin Laden was convinced that our national will would collapse with the Twin Towers. He was profoundly wrong.  As the horrifying events of that September 11 unfolded, everyone knew things would never be the same, that the trajectory of our nation’s history would be profoundly altered.  First, what emerged on that day and afterwards was an astonishing display of the strength of our civil society. Improvisational efforts abounded: Restaurants organized food deliveries for first responders; local mariners evacuated hundreds of thousands of stranded people; individuals and groups poured resources into stricken New York City. Spontaneously, on their own initiative—and from all parts of the country—nurses, doctors, medics, firefighters, law enforcement officers and numerous others volunteered to come to the city to help out.Despite extensive infrastructure damage, New York’s financial markets were reopened within days. Everyone, it seemed, was making an extra effort to deal with the unprecedented crisis. Alexis de Tocqueville, who had visited this new country in the 1830s and who wrote the classic Democracy In America, was mightily impressed by what he called voluntary associations, that is, people coming together for all sorts of purposes, whether it be professional, charitable, educational, medical, recreational or tackling a particular problem. He had never seen anything like it before. In hierarchical Europe one asked permission or waited to be told what to do; in the U.S., De Tocqueville marveled, citizens would just up and do what needed to be done. This characteristic shone through clearly that day and afterwards. Second, despite all the ghastly mistakes we’ve made, terrorist movements were thrown on the defensive.

(Photo by Mir Ahmad Firooz Mashoof/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) While we’ve been hit with periodic, life-taking strikes on American soil since 9/11, none of these attacks, thankfully, have been on a scale like that which we experienced on that terrible September day. This is not an accident. Our intelligence agencies got their acts together. Our armed services developed the needed capabilities, as did local law enforcement, especially in New York. Until August, terrorist organizations hadn’t achieved permanent success anywhere. A few years ago, for example, ISIS looked unstoppable, as it conquered territory that exceeded the combined size of Holland, Belgium and Switzerland. Although still very capable of lethal attacks, it is now but a shadow of its former self. The Taliban’s victory is a result of U.S. blunders, not of its inherent strength. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan won’t be a lasting disaster if we respond with a renewed sense of purpose—starting with a resolve to get our people and partners out of the country, whatever it takes—and if we provide ourselves with the capability to credibly counter our adversaries. We have the means, brainpower and inventiveness. The necessary will? Sooner or later, that will mightily manifest itself, as it always has in the past.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2021/09/10/911-and-its-lasting-unforeseeable-aftermath/,"9/11 And Its Lasting, Unforeseeable Aftermath"
"LAS VEGAS, NV - FEBRUARY 20: Oscar Valdez knocks-down Miguel Berchelt during their fight for the WBC ... [+] super featherweight title at the MGM Grand Conference Center on February 20, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Mikey Williams/Top Rank Inc via Getty Images) If you’re disappointed the Oscar Valdez vs. Robson Conceicao is even occurring Friday night, you’re not alone. After all, Valdez just tested positive for a banned substance, and it would have made perfect sense that he wouldn’t be allowed to defend his 130-pound title. But this is boxing, and for some reason, this show is going forward despite the positive test. That said, here’s everything you need to know about Oscar Valdez vs. Robson Conceicao, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win. For Valdez’s part, he’s claimed that his positive test of phentermine stemmed from drinking herbal tea and that he’s always been a clean fighter. He’s also trying not let the negative aftertaste suffocate him this week.  “I’ve just been very concentrated,” Valdez said. “… I’m just excited. I’ve been very focused on not looking at anything negative out there. It has been a little difficult—I can’t lie—but this is what we have to go through. This is what it’s going to be.” That seems to be the approach Conceicao is taking as well. “About the problem with the champion, what is done is done,” he said. “There is no explanation, but I’m here to do my best and fight the greatest fight of my life.”  Already, Conceicao has shown he knows how to beat Valdez. The two faced each other as amateurs more than a decade ago in the finals of the Pan American Games, and Conceicao, a 2016 Olympic gold medalist from Brazil, prevailed over Valdez by a single point. Don’t think that Valdez has forgotten that moment.  It “was a back-and-forth fight, but I lost. I always took my losses very seriously. Everybody hates losing, and I’m one of them,” Valdez said. “I’m a sore loser. Now that I get the chance to fight him as a professional, I’m taking this fight very seriously like all the fights. I’m defending my title, and I’m going to do whatever it takes and whatever I got to defend my title and avenge my loss.” Here’s more info on the Oscar Valdez vs. Robson Conceicao showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on ESPN+ beginning Friday night at 10 p.m. ET. TUCSON, ARIZONA - SEPTEMBER 09: Oscar Valdez (L) and Robson Conceição (R) during the weigh in for ... [+] the WBC super featherweight championship at Casino del Sol on September 09, 2021 in Tucson, Arizona. (Photo by Mikey Williams/Top Rank Inc via Getty Images) When the odds first emerged for this fight, Valdez was a humongous favorite, but 24 hours before the bout was to begin, the odds moved in Conceicao’s favor. As of this writing, Valdez is still a healthy -1400 favorite, meaning you’d have bet $1,400 to win $100, while Conceicao was a +800 underdog (earn $800 on a $100 wager). For comparison, Valdez was -2000 earlier in the week.  Clearly, you shouldn’t bet Valdez’s money line, but I wouldn’t mind taking him to win by KO/TKO at -200 or to win by KO/TKO in rounds 7-12 at +140. Still, it’s not going to be easy to win much money on this fight, because there’s just not a ton of value to be had. Unless you want to take a chance on the underdog. In that case, you should probably go with Conceicao to win by decision at +1800. If you were looking for a fun parlay for this weekend’s action of boxing (and this is only for entertainment purposes), I might take Valdez to beat Conceicao by KO/TKO at -200, Xander Zayas to beat Jose Luis Sanchez by KO/TKO at -175, and the Evander Holyfield vs. Vitor Belfort fight to go over 5.5 rounds at -130. Hit all those bets, and you’d win $317 on a $100 wager.  Both fighters have perfect records, but Valdez turned pro five years earlier than Conceicao and has nearly twice as many fights. After his best win yet last February, a knockout victory vs. Miguel Berchelt, Valdez is 29-0 with 23 KOs. He’s also won four of his last five contests by stoppage.  Conceicao is 16-0 with 8 KOs, but he’s never faced anybody nearly as good as Valdez at the professional level. Though he’s already in his early 30s, Conceicao has been moved rather slowly in his pro career. Until Friday, that is, when he’ll go from 0-60 mph in a matter of nanoseconds. If Valdez is on his game, this will be very difficult for Conceicao.  Coming off his fantastic performance against Berchelt and with all the negative news surrounding him, it wouldn’t be shocking to see a letdown from Valdez. Normally in this spot, I would ponder taking Valdez by decision. But I think Valdez will try to put up an impressive performance and get his revenge on Conceicao by attempting to knock him out. And Valdez will succeed, winning by stoppage in the ninth round.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2021/09/10/oscar-valdez-vs-robson-conceicao-odds-records-prediction/,"Oscar Valdez Vs.

"AEW Dynamite topped WWE Raw in a key demographic this week. AEW Dynamite is right on the heels of WWE Monday Night Raw, and in some ways, already ahead of it. According to Showbuzz Daily (h/t Wrestling Inc), this week’s episode of Dynamite topped 1.3 million viewers following Sunday’s newsworthy All Out pay-per-view and edged out Raw in the coveted 18-49 demographic: “The post-All Out Dynamite drew a 0.52 rating in the key 18-49 demographic this week. This is up 40.54% from last week’s 0.37 rating...Dynamite beat this week’s Raw in key demographic viewers. Dynamite had 681,000 viewers from the 18-49 demo, while Raw had 678,000 from the 18-49 demo.” The Sept. 8 edition of Dynamite averaged 1.319 million viewers, making it the second most-watched episode since the show debuted on TNT in October 2019. It was the third straight episode of Dynamite to top one million viewers, and Dynamite has now exceed the one million viewer mark in seven of the past nine weeks. In comparison, Monday’s episode of Raw averaged 1.849 million viewers, slightly below its 2020 average of 1.880 million viewers. Of course, the viewership gap between the two shows is still significant, but momentum is a real thing—and momentum is on the side of AEW. Just over the past few weeks, AEW has drastically improved its star power with the addition of three major ex-WWE stars: Adam Cole, Bryan Danielson and CM Punk. At Sunday’s All Out, Punk wrestled his first match in seven years while both Danielson and Cole made their AEW debuts, and there’s little doubt that interest in the fallout from that show played a substantial role in AEW topping Raw in that key 18-49 demographic this week. Though WWE’s former flagship show Raw has hovered just below the two million viewer mark in recent weeks, the red brand had a lengthy stretch from May to July in which its viewership was much closer to 1.5 million, including the July 5th episode that plummeted below that 1.5 million mark. To put that into perspective, it was just in 2017 that Raw averaged more than three million viewers weekly. Raw’s dramatic decline in viewership over the past several years is a result of a multitude of factors, including a poorly booked product and reliance on part-time stars. In fact, one could argue that WWE’s decline in overall quality is what paved the way for AEW to even exist in the first place, and though it’s unlikely that AEW will be as profitable as WWE or garner as many TV viewers on a weekly basis anytime soon, all it takes is the eyeball test to see that WWE’s popularity is waning while AEW’s is growing at a rapid pace. AEW’s additions of Punk, Danielson and Cole, among others—combined with a well-booked TV product for both Dynamite and Rampage—seems to be leading to a gradual turning of the tide in the 2021 pro wrestling war, and even well-respected names within the pro wrestling industry are starting to take notice.  Here’s what WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley recently had to say on Facebook (h/t SEScooops) about AEW vs. WWE: “The problem is that WWE is no longer the place for talent to aspire to. Part of it is because AEW is doing a great job of attracting great talent, proven talent, building younger talent, creating storylines. But part of it is a problem of your own making...If I was an aspiring talent now, a big-league talent with a major decision to make, I’m not sure that I would trust WWE creative to do the right thing with my career...and until that changes WWE, you’ve got a problem.” WWE may have an even bigger problem in its plummeting TV viewership, with well over a third of its audience disappearing just over the past four years. While it will take time for Dynamite or Rampage to truly and consistently challenge Raw or SmackDown in terms of overall viewership, the gap is undeniably closing—as are other gaps between the two companies, with AEW boasting arguably a better overall roster and stronger cast of compelling TV characters.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2021/09/10/aew-dynamite-tops-wwe-raw-in-pivotal-18-49-demo-as-momentum-swing-continues/,AEW Dynamite Tops WWE Raw In Pivotal 18-49 Demo As Momentum Swing Continues
"Tara Strong in Pretty Hard Cases Tara Strong is the voice of your childhood. It’s simply a fact that isn’t up for much debate. Over the last three decades, the Toronto native has become synonymous with the world of animation via her portrayals of beloved characters like Timmy Turner (The FairlyOdd Parents), Bubbles (The PowerPuff Girls), Harley Quinn (Batman: The Animated Series), Raven (Teen Titans), and more recently, Miss Minutes (Loki). But to exclusively refer to Ms. Strong as a “voiceover artist” would be doing her quite the disservice. She is an actor, first and foremost, always on the lookout for juicy roles in any medium that can help grow her craft and defy what the entertainment industry expects of her. This desire to break the typecasting mold is what drew her to the part of formidable drug kingpin Tiggy Sullivan on IMDb TV’s cop-based dramedy, Pretty Hard Cases (now streaming). “Most of my on-camera work throughout my career has been ‘cute teacher’ on Big Time Rush or ‘cute mom’ on all these other shows. I love playing those roles, but the concept of having the depth of a character that’s so layered was fascinating — as well as the fact that it was so well-written. I was immediately intrigued,” Strong tells Forbes Entertainment during a Zoom interview. “I love this character so much. I say it’s like if Harley Quinn was a mom...that’s Tiggy Sullivan.” Tara Strong as Tiggy Sullivan in 'Pretty Hard Cases' While she has been acting since the age of 13, Strong constantly has to prove her range as a performer. “I knew it was a role that would really change me and my perception in the business of what I was capable of,” she explains. “I feel like Hollywood does put people in certain categories. ‘Oh, that’s the voiceover guy; that’s the commercial actor; that’s the soap guy.’ As well as to writers and directors. It’s not just an actor thing. So, to be able to play a role with this level of depth was very exciting to me.”  Of course, getting back into the realm of live-action is a bit like stretching an atrophied muscle. “In voiceover, you don’t have to memorize anything. Your script is right in front of you on the music stand. And on-camera, it was like, ‘Oh, I gotta get that training wheel off the bike and learn massive amounts of dialogue for these scenes.’” Co-created and showrun by former Rookie Blue producers, Tassie Cameron and Sherry White, the new series follows a duo of mismatched Canadian street cops: Samantha Wazowski (Baroness von Sketch Show’s Meredith MacNeill) and Kelly Duff (Orange is the New Black’s Adrienne C. Moore).  “I don’t know that I’ve seen a show do that particularly with women in the driver’s seat and I think that’s what sets it apart from other shows,” Strong says. “Also, throughout the show, they’ve maintained brilliant writing. Every script, I would text them and go, ‘Oh my God, I love this episode!’” Despite their vastly different approaches to police work, Samantha and Kelly must put aside their petty squabbles in order to take down the Stockwoods, a local gang that’s been peddling narcotics and wreaking general havoc on the community.  As the season unfolds, however, the two women come to find that they do have some common ground: loneliness, dysfunctional families, and screwed-up love lives. What’s more, they come to realize that their professional goals may not be in line with what they want in their personal lives. “It’s all women who are the creators and writers and stars of this show. Mostly women who understand what it is like to be under the thumb of a misogynist,” Strong continues. “Particularly Tiggy, my character, when she arises, she is a phoenix. She’s like, ‘I don’t need a man to make this work.’ The undercurrent of the women taking their own power transcends through the screen for sure. It also is unafraid to go into subject matter that’s challenging.” Pretty Hard Cases was shot in Canada last year at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, testing, social distancing, and other health safety measures among the cast and crew were a regular occurrence. Instead of creating a sense of alienation and isolation, Strong asserts that the scariness and uncertainty of the global health crisis brought everyone closer together. “With this show, everyone was masked,” she adds. “On my last day, I gave a speech to the crew, thanking them, and I’m like, ‘I love you all so much and I don’t know that I’d even recognize you in person.’ ... I was like, ‘We’re connecting more on a spiritual feeling level rather than being able to see faces.’” Tara Strong as Tiggy Sullivan in 'Pretty Hard Cases' Production also took place during the worldwide movement against racism following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police officers. According to strong, the show is “not afraid to attack those very challenging issues. There’s a lot of racial issues that are handled in a unique way between these two women.” Overall, Strong can say with absolutely certainty that she had “no negative experiences from working on the show,” calling it “a total dream come true.” She concludes: “It is one of those shows that if you ever had to label something as a ‘dramedy,’ in my opinion, Pretty Hard Cases masterfully handles that. Where it’s very serious moments and situations and also very comedic scenes around those very serious moments.” Season 1 of Pretty Hard Cases is now streaming on IMDb TV.  Karen Robinson, Dean McDermott, Al Mukadam, Percy Hynes White, and Katie Douglas round out the rest of the cast.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2021/09/10/voiceover-vet-tara-strong-explains-how-pretty-hard-cases-helped-her-break-the-typecasting-mold/,Voiceover Vet Tara Strong Explains How ‘Pretty Hard Cases’ Helped Her Break The Typecasting Mold
"The companies behind the Pfizer vaccine are nearly ready to seek approval for the jab’s use among children as young as five years old and should make that request within the next few weeks, the founders of vaccine maker BioNTech said in an interview published Friday.  A student receives a temperature check in Culver City, California.  The founders of BioNTech, which worked with Pfizer to develop the vaccine, told German newsweekly Der Spiegel that the company will file the results of its trial of the vaccine in children between five and 11 years old and request approval of the vaccine globally “over the next few weeks.”  “Things are looking good, everything is going according to plan,” said BioNTech’s chief executive, Ugur Sahin, noting that the raw data is currently being prepared for regulatory filing.  Özlem Tureci, BioNTech’s chief medical officer, said the companies are working to produce smaller doses of the vaccine in preparation for approval by authorities.  The company has also laid out plans to seek approval for the vaccine in children between six months and two years old later this year.  An uptick in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations among children has driven increased urgency for the vaccine’s approval among younger kids. Though severe disease and death from the virus is still extremely rare, more children are hospitalized with Covid-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. Data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows over 2,500 kids are currently admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. This coupled with a surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has overwhelmed pediatric facilities across the country.  251,781. That’s how many children tested positive for Covid-19 last week as kids make up an increasingly large share (about 27%) of the U.S.’s total new cases.  Moderna is also looking to make its vaccine available for children under 12 years old. The company said on Thursday it has now fully enrolled a trial testing its shot for kids between six and 11 years old.  “At Least 250,000 Kids Tested Positive For Covid In The U.S. Last Week As School Year Surge Continues” (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/10/pfizer-biontech-to-seek-approval-for-first-covid-vaccine-for-young-children-in-next-few-weeks/,Pfizer-BioNTech To Seek Approval For First Covid Vaccine For Young Children ‘In Next Few Weeks’
"'Malignant'  There will be few spoilers beyond first-act plot and what’s revealed in the theatrical trailers.  James Wan isn’t trying to redefine the horror movie for the third time, following Saw in 2004 and Insidious in 2011. No, his latest original horror romp, Malignant, just wants to rock and/or roll and get the audience dancing to its specific beat. I’m not quite sure why Warner Bros. mostly hid this one from the press, but this is one of the better “hidden from critics” horror movies, I don’t know, ever? Its arch tone and macabre humor will throw off some folks, and the film certainly goes in some “take it or leave it” directions. But when your last two “big” movies (Furious 7 and Aquaman) essentially “saved” two different studios’ most valuable IP (while the middle one Conjuring 2 cemented a viable cinematic universe), you can afford to party with the boss’s credit card.  Annabelle Wallis’ Madison Mitchell is stuck in an abusive marriage, a situation compounded by a history of recent miscarriages. After a violent outburst results in a bloody head injury, she is doubly traumatized when a mysterious... something attacks the both of them with horrific consequences. Without going into details better left to the film itself, Madison’s recovery dovetails with a series of grisly murders seemingly carried out by her assailant, with the caveat that she has been cursed by real-time visions of these ghoulish crimes. The cops (a dynamic Mulder/Scully-like duo played by George Young and Michole Briana White) are sympathetic to a point, and there are some odd coincidences related to unrevealed or suppressed childhood traumas, but at some point our bereaved heroine starts to look less like a victim and more like a murderer.  First, you should know that the Seattle-set chiller has a much larger scale than what’s teased by the two (comparatively minimalist) trailers. Moreover, yes, there are plenty of unspoiled goodies in terms of plot turns, character beats and set-pieces. The movie hits the ground running with a 1993-set flashback set in a gothic “only in horror movies” mental hospital only to leap into an opening sequence which gets the trailers’ big horror pay-off beat (concerning Madison’s husband, played by Jake Abel, being attacked) out of the way. Just as we were thrilled when we realized that Tom Cruise’s “hang on to that airplane” stunt was merely the prologue of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, you’ll sit right up when you realize that what was sold as a big third-act turn is merely a curtain-raiser.  While Malignant, penned by Wan, Ingrid Bisu and Akela Cooper, would prefer you be surprised, it doesn’t play so close to the vest that you’re waiting for the movie to catch up with you. This is not a film rooted in subtly, and even if you guess some of the big picture details there’s still plenty of entertainment value in the journey. The picture slowly expands its scope beyond just a young woman being haunted in a mostly empty house, even if it sticks to that formula just long enough to give you a patented “camera floats through the house before the big scare” shot (this time from a bird’s eye view), while periodically playing like a big city police thriller. It may have the best foot chase in a “horror” movie since Se7en.  The many bloody killings give you just enough gore to be grossed out without reveling in the carnage. The overall template is a skewed riff on Giallo flicks, with a touch of 70’s DePalma and the grindhouse flavor of the mid-80’s/early 90’s Nightmare On Elm Street knock-offs. Not unlike Sam Raimi’s Drag Me To Hell, it’s a polished horror movie that might almost even play better on a mediocre VHS copy of a copy watched at 3:00 am in the morning. Although, yeah, you’ll get your money’s worth in a theater. The film’s onscreen menace, named Gabriel and presenting himself as a kind of childhood imaginary friend gone awry (think Drop Dead Fred but with folks very much dropping dead), is a unique and disturbing onscreen boogie man with a grotesque and otherworldly appearance. The film has its share of intentional chuckles, with knowing non-verbal reactions (it’s all Wan can do to not have certain reveals punctuated by a thunder clap), Joseph Bishara’s over-the-top score and often over-the-top reveals. This movie knows it’s silly and dares you to take it too seriously. Young and White have amusing chemistry, and it’s frankly nice to see a major Asian character who seems to be a blissfully unaware chick magnet. Bisu has fun as a “too excited by the carnage” CST, while Maddie Hasson offers sturdy support as Maddie’s unconditionally supportive sister. Yes, a young woman escaping from an abusive relationship and reconciling with her sister may remind folks of Leigh Whannell’s Invisible Man, but the movies eventually go their own way and would make a pretty great double feature.  I wouldn’t dream of even hinting at where the journey heads as it rounds the final lap, but it’s a huge swing that mostly connects for a genuinely show stopping finale. Annabelle Wallis anchors this whole absurd enterprise in what’s a very challenging “in almost every frame of the damn movie” starring role. She is played as a child flashbacks by, as required by law, McKenna Grace, which (while she’s excellent per usual) also feels like a knowing nod. The whole film, warts and all, plays like a kid stuck overnight in a candy store eating as much as he can before the store opens in the morning. Save for some arguable “non-biological family is family too” themes, there isn’t a single vitamin or mineral to be found. This is a straight-up sugar rush.  Malignant is a spectacularly goofy and unapologetically over-the-top horror extravaganza from a guy who has the capital to get a major studio to finance a “big” original horror movie and the skill to make the most of it. While I won’t pretend to have seen every VOD indie horror gem released thus far, Malignant is my pick for the best major studio/wide release theatrical horror movie of 2021. I’m not sure why WB seemingly treated this film like a radioactive diaper, with buzz about Aquaman 2 and Matrix 4 taking up most of the PR coverage in the lead-up to its release, but the end result is a happy surprise. It really is one of the best “no critics allowed” horror flicks since Psycho. James Wan’s “one for me” turned out to be a treat for all of us as well.

"Our guess is Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers will once again face Tampa Bay in the NFC ... [+] Championship Game. And for the second straight year, the Buccaneers will prevail. The Green Bay Packers will begin their 2021 season Sunday when they face New Orleans in Jacksonville at 3:25 p.m. CST. The Packers are 26-6 in the last two years, have won consecutive NFC North titles and have reached back-to-back NFC Championship Games. The problem for Green Bay is its lost both of those conference title games, including a 31-26 setback to Tampa Bay last year. As the 2021 campaign begins, here are five predictions regarding this year’s Packers: Only three players in NFL history have thrown for 50 touchdowns, or more, in a season. Payton Manning ranks first with 55 in 2013, while Tom Brady (2007) and Patrick Mahomes (2108) both threw for 50. That number figures to rise quickly in future years after the NFL added a 17th game to its schedule this season. Rodgers fired 48 touchdowns last year, an average of 3.0 per contest. Now, with an extra game and an offense that is only getting better under third-year coach Matt LaFleur, Rodgers seems poised to cross the 50-touchdown barrier. DraftKings has the over/under on Rodgers’ touchdown passes at 35.5. Do yourself a favor and take the over there.  And if you can find a prop bet on Rodgers hitting 50 TDs, take it. “You never want to rest on past merits, which I know he doesn’t,” LaFleur said. “He definitely put the work in, but I think he’s in a really good headspace and I think he’s got the right mentality, the right mind-set. He’s been excited to come to work and I think he’s done a really good job of leading a lot of those younger players and trying to get them up to speed as fast as possible.” Adams leads NFL in receiving touchdowns with 58 since 2016. That’s 11 more than any player in football.  Adams is also coming off a career year where in which he led the NFL and tied the franchise record with 18 TD catches in 2020. Adams is just 28, in the prime of his career and in the final year of his contract. Adams is an elite red zone player. And quite often , Rodgers has eyes only for Adams inside the 20-yard line. Don’t be shocked if Adams finds the endzone as often in 2021 as he did in 2020. “Obviously, I want to elevate,” Adams said. “I want to do better in every category than what I did. But I’m not going and saying, ‘OK, now it’s 20 touchdowns or whatever.’  “I would love to have 20 touchdowns. When I see that film, I want to see me impose my will on the defense. I just want teams and players to still feel the same way or be even more scared as what they were previously.” Green Bay ranked ninth in total defense a year ago. It marked the first time the Packers cracked the top-10 in total defense since their Super Bowl winning 2010 season. The Packers also ranked seventh in passing defense and 10th in sacks. That came with Mike Pettine as the defensive coordinator, though. In the offseason, the Packers dumped Pettine and replaced him with Joe Barry. In many ways, the move seems uninspired. Barry was a defensive coordinator in Detroit in 2007-08 and in Washington in 2015-16, where things went remarkably bad. Detroit ranked dead last in yards and points in both of Barry’s seasons running the defense. In 2015, Washington ranked 28th in yards (380.6) and 17th in points (23.7). Then in 2016, Washington was once again 28th in yards (377.9) and 19th in points allowed (23.9). Barry has been an assistant head coach and the linebackers coach with the Los Angeles Rams since 2017. Last season, the Rams ranked first in yards allowed (281.9), first in points allowed (18.5), first in passing yards allowed (190.7) and third in rushing yards allowed (91.3). Now, Barry gets another shot at running a defense. We’ll find out soon if the problem with Barry’s past defenses were personnel or the coach himself?. Mike Stock. Shawn Slocum. Ron Zook. Shawn Mennenga. Many have tried to coordinate successful special teams units in Green Bay over the past 16 seasons. They all have failed. Now, Maurice Drayton will be the latest to attempt fixing what’s been one of the most inept units in football dating back to 2005. The Packers’ special teams were predictably awful a year ago, ranking 31st in Rick Gosselin’s annual breakdown of 22 different special teams categories. Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur fired Mennenga, then promoted from within and hired Drayton — who had been the Packers’ assistant special teams coach the last three years. Drayton certainly his work cut out for him to reverse the fortunes of this dreadful unit. The Packers ranked dead last in 2005, 2006, 2014 and 2018 in overall special teams rankings. Green Bay also finished between 26th and 31st in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2016, 2019 and 2020. The Packers’ special teams units looked lost at times this summer, allowing huge gains in the return game.  Will anything be different with Drayton?  “They’re going to say we’re a good, sound, fundamental and technique unit,” Drayton said. History says otherwise. Since Green Bay won the Super Bowl in 2010, the postseason has served up one heartbreak after another. The Packers’ loss at Seattle in the 2014 NFC Championship Game was one of the greatest collapses in NFL history. Green Bay also lost the conference title game in 2016, 2019 and 2020. The Packers went 15-1 in 2011 — and lost their first playoff game. And there was an overtime loss to Arizona in the 2015 postseason. In all likelihood, this will be Aaron Rodgers’ last year in Green Bay. While the MVP quarterback would love to go out on a high, his disappointing play is the biggest reason the Packers are 0-4 in conference title games since 2014. On paper, this looks like a championship roster. But is it a championship team? The answer is no. After a 13-4 regular season, another NFC North championship and another trip to the NFC title game, Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will end the Packers’ season — and Rodgers’ time in Green Bay.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/10/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2021-green-bay-packers/,Five Bold Predictions For The 2021 Green Bay Packers
"“I want to scream as loud as I can that Congress and the FAA need to act to stop the next generation threat,” Timothy Bean, CEO of the counter-drone company Fortem Technologies, told me. “The threat is autonomous drones that anyone on the planet can get from Amazon or Best Buy.” While local law enforcement are trusted to use deadly force, when it comes to tackling rogue drones, their hands are legally tied, says Bean. They can acquire the technology but do not have the legal power to use it.  Before the 9/11 attacks, everyone knew that hijacked airliners could be used as suicide weapons, but it was seen as a plot device in a 1994 Tom Clancy thriller rather than a real-world risk. The nearest previous corollary was would-be presidential assassin Samuel Byck hijacking a plane on the ground in 1974, intending to crash it into the White House. His failure even to take off made such attacks look less plausible, and the measures to prevent such incidents were only put in place after 9/11. “I was impressed by the response to 9/11 by aviation security. Everything changed in one or two weeks,” says Bean. “Unfortunately it seems it takes a ‘black swan event’ to cause us to act quickly.”  Radar -guided interceptor drones able to net and capture attackers may be the safest way to tackle ... [+] he drone threat . His fear is that the next event might be a drone attack causing mass casualties. As with 9/11 everyone is aware of the possibility but adequate protection is not yet in place. Consumer drones fitted with grenades or other weapons have already carried out many attacks in Iraq and elsewhere, and large-scale attacks have been vividly depicted in in the movies and in the celebrated Slaughterbots video. Such an attack could be devastating at a stadium, festival or other large gathering. Jammers are now deployed at big events like the Olympics to stop drones. These block the radio signal between drone and operator. However, Bean says jammers are no protection against newer autonomous drones that fly themselves after launch and do not require a radio link. “Autonomous drones are becoming increasingly common,” says Bean. “It takes about three minutes to program one with a flight path from an iPad.” The threat is no longer a drone operated by someone standing in the parking lot with a radio controller. Multiple drones can be left on a rooftop close to the target well in advance, and activated from anywhere in the world.  Bean says there are good solutions to this threat, but a lack of budget and proper rules of engagement on who is allowed to bring down a drone and under what circumstances prevent them being applied. Longstanding laws prevent interference with any aircraft in flight, which includes small drones. The 2018 Emerging Threats Act gives the Department of Justice and other agencies authority to “use reasonable force” against a drone but this does not help local police. “State and local police lack the authority to take down a drone,” says Bean. “But some are following common law, using principles like the right of self-defense, the right to protect property and privacy, and trespassing laws. But what does ‘trespass’ mean when someone is flying a drone?” Equally the FAA has been looking at counter-drone approaches for years but still does not have a timeline for completing its analysis and recommendations.  If jammers are not the answer, something more robust is needed. Missiles and guns may be acceptable in war zones, but create an unacceptable risk of casualties a civilian setting. There would also be security issues with supplying something like the Army’s C-RAM – a tremendously powerful multi-barreled 20mm cannon– to civil operators, especially when it might be triggered by a stray party balloon. Military high-powered lasers  potentially offer a safer and more precise means of stopping drones, but are expensive and may not bring a swarm down swam down quickly enough. High-powered microwaves can stop a whole swarm, but Bean notes that their effectiveness falls off rapidly with range. Bean says his approach is a long-range, affordable solution with less potential for collateral damage: a ready-to-launch defensive drone force. “We believe the world is moving towards Blue Force interceptor drones,” says Bean.  Fortem’s approach starts with new radar coupled with software to detect and identify drones and other small objects that traditional systems miss. The TrueView radar is specifically designed for drone detection, unlike traditional radar which filters out slow-moving objects, and its SkyDome Manager provides full control including defining any number of geofenced danger zones.  Incoming threat drones are taken down by DroneHunter interceptors, speedy multicopters armed with netguns. An intruder can be netted and towed away safety, so that neither the drone nor any payload — which might be explosives, chemicals or other harmful material — falls to earth. It may sound like Spiderman, but it is a proven approach and safer than kinetic approaches like bullets or missiles. Currently armed with a netgun, the DroneHunter might have alternative armament options in future.  The system can co-ordinate multiple DroneHunters against multiple threats, prioritizing those which present the greatest risk based on the defined threat zones. The system has already been successfully deployed by a number of agencies in the U.S. and around the world.  Isn’t there a risk that the bad guys will increase the number of attacking drones to overwhelm the system? “There is always a balance of resources versus risk,” says Bean. “It is no different from deciding how many police officers you have for the Superbowl versus a high school band competition.” And unlike other systems, the number of interceptors available can be scaled up easily. Bean says that for one recent event there were some 23 DroneHunters on the ground.  Bean says that counter-drone defenses should be as much a part of the normal security background as fences and metal detectors at public events. While the threat is evolving fast, so are the defenses. A new video shows a DroneHunter taking down a fixed-wing drone. Bean says they have a number of future plans in the pipeline, which may include things like new electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons on the DroneHunter to burn out electronics on multiple drones at once. “We can fly an EMP into the swarm,” says Bean. “That means the range is much shorter [than for a ground-based weapon] and we can have a massive effect with that.” But while many operators are starting to invest in counter-drone systems, there is no lead from Congress or the FAA, and the longer the delay, the greater the risk. As a result of the changes to security on civilian aviation, no attack similar to the 9/11 hijackings has succeeded in the last 20 years. But the door to a drone attack is still open. And an incident last month, when a hobby drone was accidentally flown into a building in the World Tarde Center complex, is a chilling reminder of the need for better protection before the sort of black swan event that Bean fears.. “Congress must act and proactively give both local and state law enforcement the authority to stop rogue drones,” says Bean.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/09/10/why-the-next-911-could-be-a-mass-drone-attack-and-how-we-can-stop-it/,The Next 9/11 Could Be A Mass Drone Attack.

  BBY 
  store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J. closed in April, 2018, and it isn’t too hard to imagine the deserted concrete box as ground zero in the fight to save humanity from a zombie apocalypse. The empty store is being given new life - temporarily at least - as the home of a cutting edge virtual reality experience that uses dead space at malls to stage battles with the undead. It’s also a sign of what the future most likely holds for malls, as shopping centers need to become more creative about pop-up experiences to take the place of shrinking retail square footage. The virtual reality experience at Westfield Garden State Plaza, Army of the Dead Viva Las Vengeance, is the result of a partnership with Netflix 
  
  NFLX 
 , multimedia and VR studio Pure Imagination Studios, and entertainment promotion company Fever, to create an experience inspired by the Netflix film Army of the Dead. The Westfield mall chain, part of international mall operator Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, has embraced the zombie experience in a big way, installing it in an empty Debenhams department store in its mall in London, and on the roof of a parking garage at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. The empty Best Buy store at Westfield Garden State Plaza has been converted into a temporary zombie ... [+] war zone. The Viva Las Vengeance collaborators have announced plans to bring the experience to 17 U.S. cities, but locations for most of those cities have not yet been announced.  Tickets for the experience range from $19 to $37 depending on time of day, and number of tickets purchased. The experience lasts 30 minutes, including training and a briefing about the rescue mission at hand. The actual time spent shooting zombies in virtual reality is only 12 minutes, but during that brief time players have an opportunity to kill hundreds of zombies that charge the rescue vehicle has it makes its simulated way through a bombed out, war-torn Las Vegas.  Players chose a zombie fighting name and their virtual weapon when they arrive, and see how many zombies they killed on a scoreboard as they leave, a feature that according to online reviews drives repeat visits as players try to improve their score. The Best Buy at Westfield Garden State Plaza provides ample space for the briefing rooms, two trucks that hold six players each, a merchandise store, and a restaurant that serves tacos and drinks.  The Viva Las Vengeance experience is using only the first level of the two-story building.  The interior of the former Best Buy in Paramus, N.J. has been decorated to replicate scenes from ... [+] Netflix's Army of the Dead movie. While the Best Buy has been vacant for almost three and a half years, it didn’t die due to lack of retail demand. Best Buy moved the store into a new location, in a different mall less than a mile away, after Garden State Plaza took back the space in preparation for an extensive renovation proposal that will add a mixed use residential complex, and public open spaces, to the mall.  The temporary VR experience (Viva Las Vengeance typically stays at a location for about eight weeks) also is a way for mall operators to test the public’s appetite for immersive experiences, in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, before leasing space to permanent experiential tenants. Location analytics firm Placer.ai reported this week that more people are seeking experiences, as demonstrated by the impressive gains in traffic seen at gaming and dining chain Dave & Buster’s since early June. Throughout the summer the chain has seen strong traffic growth each week, compared to equivalent weeks in 2019, with growth of 6% or more each week, according to Placer.ai. Placer.ai is also seeing a slow and steady return to movie theaters, based on traffic at AMC theaters, even though levels are still close to half of what they were in 2019.  AMC reported Tuesday that it broke U.S. attendance records over Labor Day weekend, with more than two million people in its theaters over a four-day period. Admission revenue broke its 2013 U.S. record for Labor Day weekend. A player at the Army of the Dead Viva Las Vengeance experience at Westfield Garden State Plaza in ...

The producers of the show say they have extensive hygiene and social distancing regulations in place, and use Cleanbox, a UVC surface decontamination device, to clean the headsets and accessories used in the experience. The zombie-killing experience will be at Westfield Garden State Plaza through October. Netflix and Pure Imagination Studios have created a next-level immersive experience.

"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: K-pop boy band BTS visit the SiriusXM Studios on February 21, 2020 ... [+] in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) Last week, BTS’s “Butter” was down at No. 7 on the Hot 100, and while that was one rung higher than the previous frame, the downward trajectory was still clear. The track was steadily slipping on the most important songs ranking in the U.S., and it seemed its tenure as a major hit had finally come to an end. Now, the tune’s fates have changed, and it’s running the show once more after the group behind the Song of the Summer decided to give it one last push, earning a well-deserved and somewhat surprising victory lap in the process. “Butter” is back at No. 1 on this week’s Hot 100, leaping half a dozen spots inside the top 10 to conquer the tally yet again. The track gains ground thanks to the release of a remix featuring Megan Thee Stallion, one of the hottest rappers in the business right now and the current holder of the Best New Artist Grammy. The two superstar acts collaborated to alter “Butter” very slightly, just enough to convince millions to engage with the cut once more. BTS’s fourth (but not most recent) Hot 100 No. 1 has now led the charge on the tally for 10 weeks, easily making it their longest-running champion and the first song to reach double-digit frames atop the ranking in 2021. The title was already the bestselling of the year and the biggest release in many other regards, so the South Korean vocal troupe didn’t have to work it any more, but they are never ones to rest on their laurels or relax.  This latest week running the Hot 100 is a celebration for the group, as they make history in a number of manners by vaulting back to the summit. It’s a demonstration of power, as they can apparently score a No. 1 hit whenever they want, even convincing more than 100,000 people to buy a track that has already outsold every other title in the largest music market in the world several times over. The remix is a play for possible love at awards shows, as well as a perfect ending to the season the tune was designed to dominate (as it did). At this point in a single’s life cycle, most musicians would move on from the success. “Butter” had already risen as high as a title can and lived there for quite some time, and it appeared there was nothing else for it to do but quietly slip and vanish from the Hot 100. BTS showed that no matter what has already happened with a song or what the numbers may be saying about a certain composition, there is always something that can be done to change the story.  Not all musicians or groups have the resources to pull off what BTS just managed with “Butter,” but even those who can’t recruit a chart-topping rapper for a remix or push a new tune to radio DJs everywhere can still squeeze a little bit more life out of their favorite track. All musical acts, big and small, should pay attention to BTS’s latest move, while fans should sit back and enjoy the moment of glory once again.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/10/btss-butter-remix-with-megan-thee-stallion-is-just-a-victory-lap-for-the-band/,BTS’s ‘Butter’ Remix With Megan Thee Stallion Is Just A Victory Lap For The Band
"In 'Miracle: Letters to the President' traveling on the railroad tracks is the only option Joon-kyeong, the protagonist in Miracle: Letters to the President, lives in a village so remote that getting to the nearest train station can be a matter of life or death. Trains run through his village but they do not stop there. To reach school and other amenities, the villagers have to walk on the railroad tracks and, given the unpredictable train schedule, such walks sometimes end in tragedy. Joon-kyeong, played by Park Jung-min, has a dream. It’s the only dream he dares to have, but he’s committed. He wants to build a train station in his village so no more lives are lost.  Miracle: Letters to the President is a fictionalized account of the building of Yangwon station in North Gyeongsang Province. South Korea’s only privately built train station opened in 1988 and remained open until 2012 when transportation to the area improved. Set in the 1980s, the film is a hopeful tale about the importance of staying true to a dream.  Joon-kyeong repeatedly writes the president of Korea, asking him to authorize a train station for his village, but never gets a response. When he starts high school, his commute via the railroad tracks is dangerous and time consuming. Fortunately, the long commute does not affect his studies. He’s a math prodigy.  New possibilities begin to materialize for Joon-kyeong after he meets his enthusiastic high school classmate Ra-hee, played by Im Yoona. She’s a strong believer in pursuing dreams and she wants to be his muse.  His father, played by Lee Sung-min, is a railroad engineer and the two don’t spend much time together. Yet, when Joon-Kyeong is offered a promising escape from their remote village he’s reluctant to leave. It’s Joon-kyeong’s relationship to his sister that constitutes the emotional core of the film and realizing the extent of that relationship provides a new perspective on his decisions.

"Michail Antonio of West Ham United performed a Dirty Dancing-inspired goal celebration after ... [+] becoming the club's all-time top scorer in the Premier League. (Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images) Is Michail Antonio playing better than he ever has?  ""I've been on and off with West Ham, I've had some good seasons and some not,"" he tells me in an interview. ""But for the start of this season, in three games I've got four goals and three assists. I don't think I've ever got those stats in my career so it definitely has to be the best performance so far."" The 31-year-old West Ham United striker has had a month to remember. In West Ham's second match of the season, he starred against Leicester City, creating one goal and scoring two in a 4-1 victory. The first of those goals made him West Ham's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League. He added another in the draw with Crystal Palace, taking his tally for the Hammers to 50 league goals. ""I never really thought about becoming the all-time top goalscorer. Because when I first signed for West Ham, I was just trying to get a game,"" Antonio, who was named Premier League player of the month and made his international debut for Jamaica this week, says. ""Every time a new manager came in, I always got dropped to the bench and had to work my way back into the team. So it's been a big fight for me. To be able to say I'm the all-time top goalscorer, it's just an amazing feeling."" London-born Antonio, who joined West Ham in 2015, has had an unusual path to the Premier League.  Aged 14, he had a trial with Tottenham Hotspur but his mother insisted he concentrate on his education. Antonio secured a diploma in sport while playing for Tooting & Mitcham United, a club outside English soccer's professional pyramid. He considered applying for university before signing professional terms with Championship club Reading and believes the unconventional journey has been an advantage. ""It's helped me massively. The way I play, people might say I'm not technically the best. They say I'm powerful, I'm strong. But one thing I learned from when I was young is how to help my team win the game. And that's scoring goals and being strong,"" he says. ""I had to be resilient playing non-League because I was 17 playing against men. I always knew how to beat someone and how to use my body. And that's one thing academy players don't really learn. Because in the academy you're playing against people your age. I was always playing against men."" While Antonio, who has previously played as a right back and right winger, uses his powerful frame to full effect, there is more to his game than strength. Last year, he scored a stunning overhead kick against Manchester City and his link-up play to set up Pablo Fornals' goal against Crystal Palace showed another side of his abilities.    LONDON, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 24: Michail Antonio of West Ham United scores his team's first goal ...

Sporting stadiums around the UK remain under strict restrictions due to the Coronavirus Pandemic as Government social distancing laws prohibit fans inside venues resulting in games being played behind closed doors. (Photo by Justin Tallis - Pool/Getty Images) Off pitch, Antonio has invested in Rezzil, a Manchester-based virtual reality platform for elite sports. The company, which counts Premier League clubs among its clients, offers virtual training and rehabilitation drills for players by ""simulating game pressure scenarios"".  Rezzil secured $2.7 million for the launch of its consumer platform, Player 22, last month. As well as Antonio, current and former players invested in the company include Thierry Henry, Gary Neville, Vincent Kompany and Tyrone Mings. In a press release, Arsenal legend Henry said Rezzil was ""one of the most promising technologies to enter the sport"". Antonio used the VR technology while recovering from a hamstring injury and when teams were unable to train together due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""It's accessible and easy to set up in your front room and, because it's not too strenuous on the body, you're always able to use it if you're injured or if you're not,"" he says. Designed and tested by UEFA pro licensed coaches, Player 22 is the consumer platform from VR ... [+] platform Rezzil. Players can face drills to test skills including heading and shooting.  ""It's very realistic. If you don't strike the ball properly it won't go into the back of the goal. When you're swinging your foot it actually feels like you're connecting with something. ""If I'm passionate about something I believe in, then I'm more enticed to put my money into it."" Antonio, whose other investments include content organizer Wakelet, is also set to enter the world of NFTs.  After his record-breaking goal against Leicester, he celebrated by holding a cardboard cut-out of himself above his head, a move inspired by a scene from the movie Dirty Dancing. The original plan was for one of Antonio's teammates to lift him, as Patrick Swayze's character does to Jennifer Grey's in the movie. ""Then I realized, I'm 95kg (209 pounds). No one's doing that to me,"" Antonio says. The National Football Museum in England has asked if it can add the cardboard cut-out to its collection and Antonio also wants to mark the iconic moment. Together with The MailRoom and TRNSMISSION, Antonio is planning to auction an NFT digital image of the cut-out along with a physical second cut-out and his shirt from the match. A percentage of the proceeds will be donated to charity.  On the pitch, his immediate focus is adding to his goals tally. But he is confident enough to already be thinking about how to celebrate the next milestone. ""I always want to better myself. And last season, I finished on 10 goals and five assists. So I definitely want to beat both of those stats this year,"" he says.  ""Hopefully I can just keep the roll going and make sure I keep bettering myself because I missed a lot of years in the Prem(ier League). I got into the Prem at 25 and I started really playing at 26. So I'm hoping I can stretch it out for a bit longer. ""If I get to 100 league goals, I've got something on par with Dirty Dancing.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertkidd/2021/09/10/west-hams-michail-antonio-is-having-the-time-of-his-life/,West Ham's Michail Antonio Is Having The Time Of His Life
"'Ta Chiang.'  The Taiwanese navy just commissioned its newest homemade warship—a 213-foot, high-speed catamaran packing 12 anti-ship missiles and 16 air-defense missile.  Ta Chiang already had a nickname when she commissioned on Thursday. “Carrier-killer.” In other words, a possible countermeasure to the Chinese navy’s steadily-growing fleet of flattops. But China’s carriers—two in service, one under construction—might not be the greatest threat to Taiwan’s sovereignty. Unassuming floating causeways arguably pose a greater danger to the island country. It’s this “lighterage” that Taiwan perhaps should target as it deploys as many as a dozen catamaran warships. Barge-busters rather than carrier-killers. Ta Chiang improves on the prototype vessel of the class, Tuo Chiang, which launched in 2014. Tuo Chiang proved the type’s basic layout—a 76-millimeter gun on the bow, four angled box launchers for missiles nestled behind the bridge, a close-in defensive gun aft of the launchers. A flight deck on the stern. Forty-one crew. A 45-knot top speed. Tuo Chiang carries eight subsonic Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles and eight supersonic Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles in two pairs of quad launchers. The Hsiung Feng II has a 100-mile range. Hsiung Feng III travels twice as far. Tuo Chiang packs tube launchers for anti-submarine torpedoes but lacks heavy air-defenses. Naval planners apparently decided the catamaran wasn’t very useful as a sub-hunter—and also was hurting for air-defenses. On the follow-on Ta Chiang, they omitted the torpedoes and replaced one of the Hsiung Feng III launchers with a 16-round launcher for TC-2N surface-to-air missiles with an approximately 20-mile range. Each vessel sails with a sensor suite to match its weaponry. Tuo Chiang has sonar. Ta Chiang doesn’t.  Small but heavily armed and inexpensive at just $73 million, Ta Chiang fills an obvious niche at the low end of Taiwan’s surface fleet, which at present is top-heavy with big, expensive American- and French-made destroyers and frigates. “I believe that with the addition of this warship, the navy’s task of defending the sea and territories will be even more powerful,” Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen said. It’s not however clear that Ta Chiang poses a serious threat to China’s flattops, which usually sail with several escorting frigates, destroyers and cruisers and are, like all aircraft carriers, some of the most heavily-defended vessels in the world.  The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy is building up to 16 Type 055 cruisers, each with 112 vertical cells for long-range missiles. It would be surprising if, in wartime, a Chinese carrier deployed without one or two Type 055s in tow. Taipei plans to build 10 additional catamarans like Ta Chiang. If all 12 catamarans fired all of their ASMs at the same time, that would amount to 148 missiles. A pair of Type 055s could fire an air-defense missile at each incoming Taiwanese munition and still have rounds to spare. It’s not the catamaran flotilla can’t get lucky and land a blow on a Chinese flattop. But Chinese carrier groups have bigger problems than Taiwanese catamarans. American and Japanese submarines, for one.  And there are far juicier targets than any flattop. Carriers can’t land troops on Taiwan’s beaches. Carriers can’t hold ground. But lighterage can land troops. And without lighterage, the People’s Liberation Army probably stands little chance of capturing Taiwan. That’s because the PLAN so far operates just 11 large amphibious assault ships and 64 tank landing ships—enough amphibious lift to land around 25,000 troops and a few hundred tanks. That’s a fraction of the roughly million men and thousands of vehicles Beijing might need to put ashore to overcome Taiwanese defenses. China’s thousands of civilian merchant ships, legally absorbed into naval service, would transport the balance of the invasion force. But unless shock troops succeeded in seizing a Taiwanese port without seriously damaging it, these merchantmen would need some way of offloading their passengers and cargo. That’s where lighterage comes it. It’s a floating dock that the merchant ships themselves can haul in pieces then crane into the water to create a temporary path from ship to near-shore. A semi-submersible barge is the final piece. The off-ramp. Analysts Michael Dahm and Conor Kennedy detailed China’s lighterage in an exhaustive report for the Center for International Maritime Security.  An early lighterage system first appeared in public in 2012 after extensive development, according to Dahm and Kennedy. “A team of engineers at the PLA’s Military Transportation University worked for over a decade to overcome the engineering challenges associated with the system, especially as they related to connections between the modules and shallow water propulsion,” Dahm and Kennedy wrote.  A newer, heavier-duty lighterage debuted last month. “It is much more substantial and longer than the older floating pier, extending approximately 1,475 feet from the shore,” according to Dahm and Kennedy. Needless to say, a quarter-of-a-mile-long floating causeway is a major bottleneck. Forget flinging a bunch of catamarans at a heavily-armed carrier group. Aim them where they can do the most good. At the thin, fragile thread connecting China’s invasion fleet to Taiwanese soil.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/10/forget-carrier-killers-what-taiwan-needs-are-barge-busters/,Forget Carrier-Killers.

"Two-time Pro Bowl linebacker Matt Judon signed a four-year contract worth up to $56 million with the ... [+] New England Patriots in March. (Winslow Townson/AP Images for Panini) When Matt Judon was on the field for the New England Patriots in August, the bright red sleeves, visor and No. 9 jersey helped distinguish him. But they weren’t the primary tell. The veteran outside linebacker’s impact was. “We want to be loud and we want to make sure we’re all on one accord,” Judon said during his press conference on Thursday. “I think that’s how you have good defenses and that’s how you don’t make mistakes. If ten people are right out there and one is wrong, it can lead to big plays. And we don’t want to give up big plays.” Judon earned a defensive grade of 94.2 from Pro Football Focus during his initial preseason with New England, which placed second around the NFL among edge players. Through only 34 snaps, he was credited with three solo tackles to go with a quarterback hit, a pair of hurries and a forced fumble against former Baltimore Ravens teammate Joe Flacco. It proved to be what New England sought as free agency opened in March, signing Judon to a four-year contract worth up to $56 million with $30 million fully guaranteed. It proved to be a fit along the front seven as well as in the locker room. “It’s been great,” Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower, a four-time captain, told reporters of Judon on Thursday. “Man, Judy’s a character. He definitely sets the whole mood for the defense as far as the music in the locker room. He works hard and he has fun doing it. I think overall, that’s the one thing that guys respect and appreciate from Judon coming in, being a new guy, new signing or whatever. But him coming in and working as hard as he does and not loafing, wanting to push guys to do a little bit more, a little extra and having a lot of fun along the way. I think a lot of guys appreciate and respect that.” As the Patriots returned for the start of training camp, the 29-year-old newcomer returned with an AUX cable and speakers for the locker room. It has provided a tone as the calendar turns to September. “At first, it was no music in there. Everybody was wearing headphones,” Judon said. “Now we’re kind of on the same vibe. It sets the mood for practice. It sets the mood for practice and intensity for the day.” A product of Division II Grand Valley State, Judon amassed 34.5 sacks during his days as a member of the Ravens. Ohio State’s Joey Bosa, Maryland’s Yannick Ngakoue, Mississippi State’s Chris Jones and Oregon’s DeForest Buckner stand as the lone members of his 2016 draft class to eclipse that total during their regular seasons. All of whom went before Judon, who had his name called in the fifth round at pick No. 146 overall. There have been 49 games started. There have been 54 tackles for loss. There have also been seven fumbles forced, two fumbles recovered and a safety. A Pro Bowler in consecutive campaigns, Judon played on the $16.8 million franchise tag with Baltimore last campaign before finding his way to Foxborough. “I really haven’t changed anything I’ve done since I’ve been in the league,” Judon said. “I come in, play music, talk trash. I’m loud. I believe they all just accept it. They’re all like, ‘All right, this is who this guy is and this is how he’s been since he’s been in the league.’”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2021/09/10/veteran-linebacker-matt-judon-bringing-an-edge-to-the-new-england-patriots-defense/,Veteran Linebacker Matt Judon Bringing An Edge To The New England Patriots’ Defense
"Detroit Tigers' Casey Mize pitches against the Texas Rangers during the first inning of a baseball ... [+] game Monday, July 19, 2021, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Duane Burleson) The Detroit Tigers will miss the postseason for the seventh straight year, an outcome expected from the day spring training began. However, the Tigers finally appear to have hope, some light at the end of a very long rebuilding tunnel. The Tigers are 66-75 with 21 games left in the season. It might not seem like much but it’s far better than the records Detroit have put up in recent years. In both 2017 and 2018, the Tigers finished at 64-98 then sank all the way to 47-114 in 2019. They were 23-35 during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. So, compared to the previous four years, nine games under .500 with a little more than three weeks left in the season is progress. A.J. Hinch, in his first season as manager, hesitates to break down the season in detail because, “we’re not done with our schedule yet and we want to focus on finishing the season on a good note and write a good ending to our (story) this year.” However, Hinch likes what he sees when he does allow himself to take a glimpse of the Tigers’ big picture. “We've got some ingredients here that are going to help be building blocks as far as playing the right way and doing some really good things and in earning the respect back of our fans and within the industry,” Hinch said. The Tigers are in third place in the American League Central, 15 games behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox and four games behind the second-place Cleveland Indians. With no realistic chance of catching the White Sox, the Tigers could potentially run down the Indians and wind up in second place. That would be a sign a progress for a franchise that hasn’t finished as high as second since being runner-up to the Indians in 2016. Most importantly, some building blocks are beginning to emerge for the Tigers, notably a pair of starting pitchers in right-hander Casey Mize and left-hander Tarrik Skubal, who are both 24. Matt Manning, a 23-year-old righty, is getting his first taste of the major leagues this season. Mize is 7-7 with a 3.51 ERA in 26 starts in his first full big league season. He is showing why the Tigers selected him with the first overall pick in the 2018 amateur draft. A ninth-round choice in the same draft, Skubal has broken the franchise rookie strikeouts record with 154 in 136 innings. His 8-12 record and 4.30 ERA in 27 games, though, shows the inconsistency that comes with young pitchers. Manning is having growing pains as evidenced by his 3-6 record and 6.14 ERA in 14 starts. However, the Tigers’ first-round draft pick in 2016 has also shown flashes of brilliance such as holding the heavy-hitting Toronto Blue Jays to one run in six innings Aug. 27. Leadoff-hitting left fielder Akil Baddoo looks like a potential key cog in the lineup after being selected in the Rule 5 Draft last December from the division rival Minnesota Twins. Despite having never played above Class A since entering professional baseball in 2016, the 23-year-old has hit .258 with 12 home runs and 14 stolen bases in 106 games. The Tigers also have two of the very top prospects in baseball at Triple-A Toledo in corner infielder Spencer Torkelson and outfielder Riley Greene. “We’re not where we need to be and we have a lot of work to do to get there but our guys are getting it,” Hinch said. “I’m so happy with our guys. I love this team. I love our makeup. I love our attention to detail in how we prepare. I love the fight in us, who we will come back and make you play for all 27 outs. There are a lot of attributes that will lead to a winning club. I’m very excited about the present and the future.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnperrotto/2021/09/10/detroit-tigers-begin-to-show-progress-in-long-rebuild/,Detroit Tigers Begin To Show Progress In Long Rebuild
"On September 6, the U.S. Open honored military members and the families of 9/11 victims as part of ... [+] the Lt. Joe Hunt Military Appreciation Day. Here Jenson Brooksby enters the court for his match against Novak Djokovic. (Garrett Ellwood/USTA) Sports like tennis may not be able to change what’s happened in the past. That would require a time machine made out of a DeLorean or a hot tub, the Quantum Realm, or some combination of the two. But tennis can help heal wounds from the past and serve both the present and the future. The U.S. Open has been close in more ways than one to the tragic events that happened on September 11, 2001, otherwise known as 9/11. Every year, this Grand Slam tennis tournament takes place at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. This Center is located in Queens, New York City, only about ten miles from where the World Trade Center twin towers used to stand before airplane terrorist attacks took these iconic buildings down as part of the 9/11 tragedy.  In addition to being close in proximity to the 9/11 Ground Zero site, the tournament takes place close in time to September 11 each year. The U.S. Open typically starts on the last Monday of August and then stretches for two weeks into September so that it either includes or immediately precedes September 11. And this year, the final Saturday of the tournament tomorrow will be on the 20-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives, left many more with long-term health problems, and indelibly changed American society forever.  So, the 2021 U.S. Open has been doing several things in remembrance of 9/11. Actually, make that over 100,000 things. First of all, they honored the families of 9/11 victims as part of their annual Lt. Joe Hunt Military Appreciation Day. Each year, on Labor Day for the past nine years, the U.S. Open has invited veterans of the five U.S. military service branches and their families to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to watch and play some tennis. This year military members also helped with the initial coin tosses for a couple matches on that day: one between Alexander Zverev and Jannik Sinner and another between Emma Raducanu and Shelby Rogers. The round of 16 match between Emma Raducanu (L) of the United Kingdom and Shelby Rogers (R) of the ... [+] United States took place on Lt. Joe Hunt Military Appreciation Day at the 2021 US Open. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) The U.S. Open also for the first time lit the exterior of Arthur Ashe Stadium in red, white, and blue to commemorate both Labor Day and Lt. Joe Hunt Military Appreciation Day. The day has borne the name of Lt. Joe Hunt since 2019. Hunt was the only player to ever win the U.S. national boys’, junior, collegiate and men’s singles titles. Hunt tragically died in 1945 when as a member of the U.S. Navy, his fighter plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. During Labor Day’s night session, three families of 9/11 victims received flags flown at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center as part of an on-court ceremony. Then there are the other 100,000 things that the U.S. Open has done and will do. The USTA and the USTA Foundation has committed to performing 100,000 good deeds in support of the 9/11 Day organization. A 100,000 would be a sizeable proportion, one-two hundredth, of the 20 million “acts of kindness, charity, and good deeds” goal that the 9/11 Day organization has set for the 20th anniversary of 9/11. You see, the 9/11 Day organization is trying to counter the terrible acts of 9/11 with the exact opposite, as indicated by the following tweet:  Now, 100,000 is not a trivial amount. The response to “please get me 100,000 of” anything is often “you want how many,” whether it’s hot dogs, marmots, or good deeds. Nevertheless, the USTA Foundation has in place an effective approach to this goal. They and their National Junior Tennis and Learning (NJTL) network of over 250 nonprofit youth development organizations have been offering tennis and learning opportunities for underserved youth for a while now, as I have described earlier for Forbes. So all of this seems like a good match, so to speak.  Enrique Jograj, Sam Parsons, William Cordes, Mike Dowse, Kenneth Best, Charles Johnson, Vice Admiral ... [+] Sean Buck and Jo Wallen at the Lt. Joe Hunt Military Appreciation Day at the 2021 US Open., Monday, Sept. 6, 2021 in Flushing, NY. (Nicole Pereira/USTA) Tennis has already been playing a healing role throughout much of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. If you haven’t heard yet, a pandemic, a public health emergency, has been going on since the first quarter of 2020. Back in December 2020, I reported for Forbes how tennis has experienced a boom since the Spring of 2020. That’s because tennis has offered a relatively convenient way to stay physically active and socialize while maintaining Covid-19 precautions such as staying at least six feet, or a little over one McEnroe, apart from others (because John McEnroe is about five feet and 11 inches tall.) After all, as I have written before, tennis should not involve any checking, tackling, or other close physical contact unless, of course, something has gone horribly wrong.  Tennis has offered an outlet as well for the stress and anxiety that many people have undoubtedly been feeling. Stress and anxiety are what happens when over 656,000 have died from Covid-19 and many others continue to suffer long-term health consequences. Don’t underestimate what moving your body and getting your blood and endorphins flowing while chasing a fuzzy ball around a court can do to lift your mind and spirits. At the same time, the game of tennis can bring people together in oh so many ways. Remember what activist and former leader of South Africa Nelson Mandela once said: “Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair.” Again, tennis can’t change the past. But it can make a racket, in a good way, and serve as a way to help our country heal in more ways than one. In fact, it could even help in more ways than 100,000.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/09/10/us-open-honors-families-of-911-victims-and-military-veterans/,U.S. Open Honors Families Of 9/11 Victims And Military Veterans

"Conroe Texas store Photo: By company Used with permission There is a lot of news from Academy Sports & Outdoors (Academy) that encourages investors to look forward to a strong year’s ending.  1.   The company reported sales increase 11.5%, Sales increased 44.5% over two years. 2.   The company raised full year diluted earnings per share range to $5.45 to $5.80 from $4.15 to $4.50. That is quite a jump! 3.   The company announced share repurchase authorization of $500 Million shares. It should give investors confidence that the company has cash in hand. 4.   He company plans to open 8 new Academy units in fiscal 2022 and may open more than 8 stores in later years. 259 units are now in operation in 16 states. 5.   At the end of the quarter the company had $553.8 million in cash and cash equivalent. It was upgraded by S & P (B+ from B) and Moody’s 
  
  MCO 
  (Baa3 from B1). The five facts speak well about the prospects of the company. Second quarter net sales increased 11.5% to an all-time quarterly high of $1.79 billion. When the second quarter sales are compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 (the last year before the pandemic) sales increased 44.8%. Comparable sales grew 11.4% on top of the 27% last year. Sales were driven by the sustained strength in the sporting goods and outdoor recreation market. There was strong demand for apparel, footwear, fitness and team sports. E commerce sales declined slightly (0.9%) after growing 210.3% in the prior years quarter. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, internet sales increased 207.2% As indicated above earnings guidance were raised substantially. For fiscal 2021 management expects net sales to be in the range of $6.5 billion to 6.6 billion compared to $5,689 Billion in 2020 and $4,830 in 2019. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range between $5.45 per share to $5.80 per share. That compared to $3.79 in fiscal 2020 and $1.60 in fiscal 2019. So far so good. It was managements repeated comments at the analyst meeting of work to be done, that gives me the confidence of expecting continued strong earnings growth because of the earnings opportunities. Since stores are in diverse regions - ranging from the deep South to Illinois, management decided to localize their merchandising, realizing that there are different sports in their diverse locations. Fishing needs special lures. Other sports have diverse demands, and it was pointed out that Northern stores need snow boots, skis and sleds. Hockey is another Northern sport. Management hopes to improve their supply chain which is broken for most retailers at this time. Management also sees the need to improve service (more training), the omnichannel business, marketing and merchandising including merchandise allocation. It is a lot of work, but I see great results under the present management lead by Ken Hicks, CEO and President.  Ken Hicks said: “The Academy Sports + Outdoors team delivered the best quarterly financial results in the company’s history as we surpassed the very strong store comparisons from last year. We plan to build on this continued success by further sharpening our focus o the fundamentals of the business and investing in our strategic with the goal of adding new customers, gaining market share and during sales and profit growth. I am also excited to announce the authorization of our new share repurchase program. This program signifies the current strength of the company and the confidence we have in the future of Academy”. POST SCRIPT Academy operated only in 16 states. I see the opportunity to expand into adjacent states and the fill present states with more stores. The company has a 40,000 square foot unit that lends itself to fill-in. Its regular stores are 60,000 to 62,000 square feet in size. Management believes it can handle 100 additional stores without adding more facilities.

[+] to do a victory lap in his #8 Budweiser Cheverolet Monte Carlo following his win in the MBNA-Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover Downs International Speedway in Dover, Delaware. Digital Image. Mandatory Credit: Jamie Squire/ALLSPORT On the morning of Sept. 23, 2001, 140,000 American flags measuring in at 11.5” x 17” were neatly stacked at the gates of Dover International Speedway in Dover, Del.  The first state unexpectedly became the site of Nascar’s first event after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, hosting the largest crowd in the nation after the attack. Just a three-hour drive from New York City and two hours away from Washington, D.C., Dover became the face of America’s heightened security efforts in the weeks after the worst tragedy in the nation’s history. As every attendee for the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 prepared for advanced security, they came together as one in the grandstands. The 140,000 attendees cried together and cheered together in the moments leading up to the roar of 43 racecars at the one-mile oval. “We had just about every law enforcement agency from the state and federal levels here — ATF, FBI, you name it — they were all here,” Denis McGlynn, president and CEO of Dover Motorsports, Inc., said. “They coordinated all kinds of eventualities.  “Threats could come from any direction, so they were looking at what could happen by air, cars running into the grandstand, people with bombs strapped to them or bombs hidden in trash cans. There was such a focus on not letting anything happen.”  Nascar fans cheer with American flags during the MBNA-Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover International ... [+] Speedway. Credit: Jamie Squire/ALLSPORT Prior to the race, there were multiple reports sent to Dover about suspicious people who may threaten the weekend’s activities. With heightened security, every incident was taken seriously, even if the reports were coming from hundreds of miles away. “Law enforcement later told me we got a report from Sussex County [New Jersey] about a group of people standing around a crop duster speaking Arabic,” McGlynn said. “There was another report about suspicious people in New Castle County. Given that we were going to have 200,000 people here over three days, we really needed to be on our game.” NBC’s pre-race coverage started with a major shift in tone from its usual hype. Instead of opening with racecars on pit road, the cameras focused on the Dover Air Force Base, six miles away from the track. “On a normal race weekend, that base provides 1,200 volunteers,” NBC play-by-play commentator Bill Weber announced to the audience. “This weekend, those 1,200 people are a little busier. The Nascar family is honored to share this weekend with them.” As thousands of cars pulled off North Dupont Highway on a crystal clear Sunday morning, they understood how different this 400-mile race would be. Instead of seeing fans flood the gates with the colors of their favorite drivers, everyone wore red, white and blue.  It was literally a sea of America’s colors, with Americans even painting the flag on their faces. No coolers or backpacks were allowed inside of the facility on that day, a rarity at a Nascar race. “It morphed from concern as they came from the parking lot as they had to go through all of the security measures to get into the speedway,” McGlynn said. “Once they got into the speedway with their American flags, they just took over.” A massive military parade took place on the frontstretch, with troops standing atop military vehicles, waving American flags. And, just 12 days after the attack, 10 first responders from New York City and Shanksville appeared at the speedway. ""It’s hard to describe the emotions I was feeling as I began to sing,” Lee Greenwood, who performed “God Bless The U.S.A.” on that Sunday afternoon, said. “Wounded, like all of America, it was a difficult place for me to be. Wanting to represent the country and fight back my personal emotions, I will never forget the events of 9/11 nor singing at Dover for the Nascar race to uplift America.” This was already a year of mourning for Nascar. On Feb. 18, Dale Earnhardt Sr. was tragically killed in the final turn on the final lap of the Daytona 500. Suddenly, the sport was without its voice and pioneer. When the attacks occurred, it left Nascar in a scurry for the second time in just seven months. The sanctioning body postponed the race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway — the final race of the year — until Nov. 23, originally slated for Sunday, Sept. 16. Then-Nascar President Mike Helton became one of the faces of the sport. He is the man who publicly addressed America  from the Daytona International Speedway media center when Earnhardt died, and he led the efforts to make sure a race could happen safely. “There was a lot of conversation, dialogue and effort that had to go in to ensure we did it as safely as possible,"" Helton said. “It came with some uniqueness because we never had anything like this happen to us. “Denis McGlynn and his staff absolutely put the parts and pieces together in a way that really made that weekend so special. As Tanya Tucker started singing the Star-Spangled Banner at Dover, everyone joined in unison. Jeff Gordon, seen on pit road, was seen murmuring the words, as were the thousands of people in the stands.  “Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,” she sang softly.  “Woooo!” the crowd roared.

U-S-A!” the fans shouted for 20 seconds straight until they saw dozens of doves fly into the air. The 43 drivers prepared to enter their workspace for 400 miles of racing. Some, such as Kenny Schrader, removed their normal paint schemes and adorned the American flag instead.  And when the drivers hugged their loved ones before entering the cars, the B-roll on NBC showed one sign, in particular, that stands out to this day. “To Our Heroes, THANK YOU!” “It was electrifying,” McGlynn said. “It was such a patriotic day.” “There was a part of me that felt Nascar was helping the country,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said last week. “You looked up in the grandstands and every person there was holding an American flag. That made your heart stop and you had a massive sense of pride well up inside of you. “I don’t think you will ever see a more patriotic moment in racing.” As the drivers prepared to take the green flag, the crowd of 140,000 people wouldn’t settle down. It was time for America to begin the healing process. “By us going back to the racetrack, putting on a race, celebrating the country and showing our patriotism, it was helping the rest of the country understand we have to get back up and keep moving forward,” Earnhardt said. But the work to make the event happen wasn’t easy by any means necessary. Besides the added security, Nascar needed to communicate with the drivers in order to tell them what they were about to experience. Back then, there were no mass emails, social media or texting threads for drivers to communicate with one another. For a while, they were left in the dark as to what would happen.  “There was so much uncertainty and unknowns about how long we would not race,” Earnhardt said. “No one knew how it would impact everyday life or the industry. No one knew what the next steps were. It was kind of scary, honestly. You were hearing a lot of speculation, not knowing exactly what Nascar had planned and what they were going to do.” While the drivers wanted to do their job and race, they understood the difficulty of making such a decision. Nascar handled the situation delicately, with Helton at the helm. An already difficult year for Nascar just became more challenging. For the second time in seven months, all eyes were on America’s largest form of motor sports. Whatever Nascar would do, the rest of the sporting world would soon follow suit. If Nascar could get back going, it was a sign other sports could as well. After plenty of internal deliberation, Helton dialed McGlynn at his Dover office. It was go time. “Mike is a man of few words,” McGlynn said. “He just called and said, ‘You’re up.’ He said there’s going to be a lot going on and we’ll be talking a lot during the week.” But once the drivers arrived at the racetrack, things calmed down — at least for them — for the time being.  Friday and Saturday’s at-track events went by smoothly. Everyone noticed the heightened security, but no one dared to speak about the unthinkable events that struck our nation, just 165 miles northeast from Dover. Throughout the weekend, conversations in the garage went on as normal. All of the drivers and team members just wanted some sense of normalcy. After all, nothing about the weekend was actually normal besides cars hitting the pavement on the Monster Mile.

Credit: Jamie Squire/ALLSPORT “It felt like this is where we belong,” Earnhardt said about arriving at the track. “This is what is comfortable and this is what feels right. With anything like that — what happened to me in my life personally — I always felt like when I got to the racetrack, it was like entering a family home. You’re around people who love and respect you. Being at the racetrack, for me personally, was a very safe place.” Earnhardt was quite lost after the 9/11 attacks. It truly hit him at his core. Alone in his North Carolina home, his brain was in overdrive. The anger of unexpectedly losing his father, who was the face of the sport, never left the mind of the 26-year-old racer. Not only was the elder Earnhardt a legend in of himself, but he gave his son his first Nascar Cup Series opportunity with Dale Earnhardt Incorporated in a bright red No. 8 Chevrolet that instantly became an icon. Even though Earnhardt dominated and won at Daytona just after Independence Day — his first triumph since his dad’s death — life was not the same. He may have been able to put on a smile for a few moments at a time, but inside, he was hurting. “I was a boat lost at sea,” he said. “I was floundering in the distance, not sure what to do.” And when the Twin Towers fell, Earnhardt watched, just like the rest of the world. But for him, he understood — to an extent — the pain of the families who just watched their loved ones perish. “We had this happen to the country, and there was a part of me that could relate in a way to a lot of people,” Earnhardt, who paused for a moment, said. “I think anyone who lost somebody that year can relate to the loss a lot of people were feeling in that moment and during the several weeks afterwards. It’s hard for me to articulate it.  “I don’t know if it’s something I’ve ever come to understand. It’s hard for me to understand how and why all of this happened in the short amount of time that it did. It was a really difficult time, and a lot of people were dealing with difficulties. In a way, I felt like when 9/11 happened and so many people lost their lives, a part of me was like, ‘I know what that feels like.’ It’s the suddenness of it.” Evernham Motorsports pit crew members huddle after the National Anthem on pit lane prior to the ... [+] MBNA-Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover International Speedway. Credit: Jamie Squire/ALLSPORT These are the thoughts that Earnhardt had on his mind when he strapped into his Chevrolet on that Sunday afternoon. When Tucker finished singing the National Anthem, the drivers’ arms were filled with goosebumps. They never witnessed — or felt — anything like that day. “At that moment at that race, every fan in the stands had the same thing on their mind and only one thing on their mind,” Earnhardt said. “That was their pride in the USA and the fact that we’re going to come back from this. Nobody was worried about what their driver was going to do that day. Nobody was pulling against another driver to do poorly. It was one rare moment where everybody at the sporting event was thinking, feeling and wishing for the same exact thing. That’s a really cool experience.” For a while, it became a regular Nascar race. Dale Jarrett and Bobby Labonte led the field to the green flag, with Earnhardt starting in third. By the third lap, his No. 8 car took the lead. Throughout the 400-mile race, Earnhardt traded the lead back and forth with Ricky Rudd, whose No. 28 car featured a large American flag on its hood. But with 39 laps remaining in the race, Earnhardt soared past Jarrett and cruised to his second victory of the season. Instead of performing a traditional burnout (where a driver burns the tires on a car and fills the stands with smoke) he opted to go with a more somber celebration. Earnhardt grabbed an American flag from one of his Dale Earnhardt Inc. crew members, and turned his No. 8 car around so fans could see through his window. The Polish Victory Lap, which is coined after the late Alan Kulwicki, is a tradition Earnhardt knew would be perfect for this occasion. “If anybody asks me what’s one thing I would take away from 50 years here, it’s going to be that weekend,” McGlynn said. “It was just that big.” To this day, Earnhardt has trouble putting the day of Sept. 23, 2001. The win months after the loss of his beloved father, combined with his heartfelt sorrow about the terrorist attack, is one he simply cannot understand.  But what he can comprehend as he reflects on that day 20 years later is that the triumph helped heal more people than he realized at the time. “I felt like we were helping all of the people in attendance that day — maybe even the people watching at home — to understand that it’s OK to stand up and move forward,” he said. “That was what the message was from Nascar that day.  “Hopefully, us having that race and doing what we did that afternoon, helped some people realize they had to take care of themselves and of each other.” Dale Earnhardt Jr. carries a flag following his win in the MBNA-Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover ... [+] International Speedway. Credit: Jamie Squire/ALLSPORT And 20 years later, Nascar’s security is much more intricate than it once was. Dover, on that day, was the start of Nascar’s version of a miniature airport. Each Nascar track has its own security protocols to protect fans, drivers and team members. But it’s the process of making sure everyone is safe that stands out to many in the industry. “It’s the inspections at the gate,” McGlynn said of the biggest change in security over the past 20 years. “The inspections of coolers, backpacks, electric ones for metal detecting and they’re all routine now.  “It’s faster than the airport because we have so many gates. It’s the same basic procedure, except we don’t ask people to take their shoes off. They’re all wanded, and there are some gates where people just walk through metal detectors.” It was that crystal clear fall afternoon — eerily similar to the morning of 9/11 — that led Nascar to implementing security changes that are still in use to this day.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephwolkin/2021/09/10/20-years-later-the-impact-of-nascars-first-race-after-911-lives-on/,"20 Years Later, The Impact Of Nascar’s First Race After 9/11 Lives On"

(Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Former UFC champion and two-time Olympian Daniel Cormier has been cast in the lead role for a Warrior TV series set in the same world as the hit 2011 film starring Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. The news was confirmed by the original film’s director Gavin O’Connor on the 10th anniversary of the film’s release on Discussing Film. O’Connor announced that he had signed a new deal with Lionsgate to write, direct, and produce every episode of the upcoming series. The show will not continue with Edgerton and Hardy’s Conlon brother’s however and will focus on a new set of fighter’s - two men and two women - entering the famed tournament from the film, Sparta, to win a large cash prize.  O’Connor stated the series will focus on the same themes of the movie, with family drama coupled with intense mixed martial arts competition, which saw Nick Nolte nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cormier’s character - Bobby Watkins - is the only confirmed casting decision announced so far. The character is said to be living in Houston through the series and fighting to get his family out of poverty.  The two female lead characters were stated as a convicted Irish felon serving her sentence at a prison called Mountjoy, and a conservative lesbian Muslim who is trying to hide both her sexuality and her fighting life from her community just outside of Paris, France.  Cormier retired from mixed martial arts competition in 2020 after his second loss to rival Stipe Miocic in a trilogy of fights. The former champion has since become a commentator for the UFC - often with Joe Rogan and Jon Anik - and an analyst for ESPN.  Cormier has not escaped controversy even though his fighting days are now over. Conor McGregor took issue with Cormier after the analyst gave a critique of the Irishman’s recent behavior surrounding Dustin Poirier and Khabib Nurmagomedov, which was subsequently settled after Cormier put McGregor number one on his list of must-see UFC fighters.  The commentator was also involved in a heated exchange with Youtube star Jake Paul at UFC 261 after Cormier took umbrage to personal comments that Paul had made about him in the media and at the event itself then began heckling Cormier during his commentary duties leading to a confrontation.  JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA - APRIL 24: (L-R) Daniel Cormier interacts with Jake Paul during the UFC 261 ...

"Apple has denied calls from Fortnite-maker Epic Games to reinstate its developer account on South Korea's App Store in efforts to re-release its popular multiplayer game after the country passed a law that forces the iPhone maker to allow third-party payment systems for in-app transactions. Fortnite has been banned from the App Store since August last year. In a statement on Twitter, Epic said it has asked Apple to restore the Fortnite maker’s account as the company intends to re-release the game for iOS devices in South Korea. Fortnite was kicked off Apple’s App Store last year after it issued an update to allow players to pay for in-app purchases using a third-party payment system, in violation of iPhone maker’s rules. The video game publisher noted that for in-app purchases it intends to offer both Epic’s own payment systems alongside Apple’s, in compliance with South Korean law. Apple immediately rebuffed Epic’s request and told several outlets in a statement that the game developer has to first agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.”  The new South Korean legislation on allowing third-party payment systems for in-app purchases is yet to go into effect, but Apple insists that the new law will have no bearing on the company’s process for approving developer accounts. Late last month, South Korea’s parliament passed a law that banned Apple and Google from forcing app developers on their iOS or Android mobile platforms to use their proprietary billing system for charging customers on all digital purchases. Developers who have so far been forced to use these billing systems are required to pay a hefty commission—between 15% to 30%—on all transactions. Several app developers have raised concerns about Apple and Google abusing the power of their dominant ecosystems. The most high profile of these cases has involved Epic Games which is locked in a legal battle with Apple in a U.S court after its popular game Fortnite was removed from the iPhone and iPad app store. Fortnite’s termination from the App Store was a direct result of it offering an external payment option—which circumvents Apple’s 30% fee—on its game for in-app purchases, which is not allowed under Apple’s rules. Verdict on the case—which is being presided over by a California federal court judge—is yet to come, but Apple’s App Store fees are now facing a flurry of antitrust investigations in the U.S. and abroad. In July, a group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill that would bar companies from forcing their payment system on app developers. Last year, the European Union unveiled a set of proposals that would force the likes of Apple and Google to divest parts of their business if they fail to adhere to fair competition rules.

"Aparshakti Khurana poses with Helmet co-stars Prannutan Bahl, Abhishek Banerjee and Ashish Verma. An Indian film set in a small-town India, targeting those based in smaller cities and towns, and one that talks about the importance of having safe sex. What could be braver? ZEE5’s new offering, Helmet takes this rare step. Written and directed by Satram Ramani, the film features Aparshakti Khurana, Abhishek Banerjee, Ashish Verma and Pranutan Bahl in lead roles.  Helmet offers a blend of laughter and social message - a genre that usually works well with Indian audience. While the film does not make a mark in the department of being an entertainer, it certainly deserves full marks for making the best of attempts breaching one of the most taboo subjects in Indian films. The movie even tries a few lines of socio-political commentary but these are quite rare.  Aparshakti Khurana with Pranutan Bahl, Abhishek Banerjee and Ashish Verma on 'Helmet' sets. While the writing and direction often falter, Helmet actors have all done their best, adding value to the experience of watching the film. Khurana plays the lead role of Lucky - a poor, orphan guy and he has two friends for support - Minus (Verma) and Sultan (Banerjee). To ensure that Lucky’s girlfriend marries him, the friends loot a delivery truck, hoping to get their hands on costly mobile phone. However, they end up with hundreds of boxes full of condoms and the story is set in a small town in India where buying and selling condoms are looked down upon.  The film then traces the story of the trio trying their best to sell the condoms. Helmet tries a lot to make it all look like social messaging packaged with comedy, but does not quite succeed at the blend. Also, it often falls short of igniting laughter.  In an interview, Aparshakti shares why he chose to do Helmet as his first film as the lead character.  “The subject (is the main reason). It is just so relevant. You are right, we are in a country where it is awkward to talk about sex. Sex education is not common in schools or colleges. It is high time we started talking about it. We often so slam down our country calling it poor or for the lack of employment or medical infrastructure. I think the root cause of all of it is population. It is high time we talk about it.” “It may be a taboo subject, but rural India needs to wake up to such things. We as public figures need to talk about subjects that make India a more mature, wiser and civilized version of ourselves. It is difficult to teach these things. But, let us try to pick these subjects in our songs, TV shows and films that can inspire people. I never imagined this (the subject and scenario of the movie), but after reading the script I was like ‘Yes, this is what happens. I think on paper, it was just as relevant as it can get.” he adds.   (The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/swetakaushal/2021/09/10/aparshakti-khurana-interview-use-of-condoms-may-be-a-taboo-but-rural-india-needs-to-wake-up/,"Aparshakti Khurana Interview: Use Of Condoms May Be A Taboo, But Rural India Needs To Wake Up"
"Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr speaks while Finance Minister Grant Robertson looks on during a ... [+] press conference at Parliament in Wellington, New Zealand.  New Zealand is tiny by economic standards, but it’s a giant in central banking circles. While working in Washington in the mid-to-late 1990s, I was struck by how often conversations with Federal Reserve officials turned to Wellington. Taking place at Reserve Bank of New Zealand headquarters were some of the globe’s most tantalizing experiments with inflation targeting and creative central bank mandates. Fed bigwigs I interviewed regularly at the time—Alan Greenspan, Janet Yellen, Alan Blinder—could not seem to get enough of RBNZ intrigue. Vanguard RBNZ is at it again. In February, lawmakers in Wellington directed Governor Adrian Orr’s team to add housing prices to the list of key variables when making interest rate decisions. This monetary mission creep, as critics see it, is turning heads around the globe. Orr’s balancing act here is increasingly shared by current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Washington, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde in Frankfurt and Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda here in Tokyo. The surge in property values in the Covid-19 era are intensifying inequality troubles everywhere. Certainly, Reserve Bank Australia Governor Philip Lowe has his own challenges balancing booming real estate values and stagnant wages. Suddenly, decisions about tapping on the monetary brakes, or hitting the accelerator a bit more, are infinitely more complicated than they were in late 1996. On December 5, 1996, then-Fed Chairman Greenspan asked a question that still bedevils central bankers 25 years on: “How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values?” This, remember, was at the height of the dot-com bubble. And the reaction was extreme. Days later, Greenspan was summoned to Capitol Hill to explain his apparent break with laissez-faire capitalist orthodoxy. Republicans were apoplectic. Greenspan never asked about froth again. The tech bubble got bigger and bigger before it crashed. Today, Orr finds himself in the crosshairs of apoplectic lawmakers—and pushing back against accusations that he over-stimulated asset markets. They argue that ultra-low Covid-era interest rates drove housing to unsustainable levels. Unattainable levels, too, for all too many New Zealand families. Lawmakers do have a point: New Zealand is, for better or worse, one of the hottest housing markets anywhere. Heady demand has house-price inflation surging more than 30%. It also has elected officials pointing fingers—and engaging in the political equivalent of haka. New Zealand All Blacks players perform the Haka during a rugby championship match against ... [+] Argentina's Los Pumas, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Saturday, July 20, 2019. During a tense clash with politicians last month, Nicola Willis from the opposition National Party asked: “Reflecting on how badly wrong the Reserve Bank’s forecasts have been on house-price growth, do you think you turned the money hose on too hard in 2020?” Orr was not having it. “Thank you for your sharp and pointed question,” he replied. “No, I stand by everything we’ve done and I’m incredibly proud of everything we’ve done as being critically necessary As per usual with dustups between central banks and politicians, the truth lies somewhere in between. Sure, Orr in Wellington, Powell in Washington, Lagarde in Frankfurt and Kuroda in Tokyo could have thought more about asset-market fallout when saving a cratering world economy in 2020. Absolutely. But a mistake politicians have been making since the 1990s is now coming back to bite them: handing the keys to central bankers. In the mid-1990s, a period of remarkable peace and prosperity for developed nations, lawmakers were keen to let monetary officials drive the economy. A liquidity nip here, a tuck there, a big blast of cash over that way and government officials could focus on other things. In 1994, when Barings Bank collapsed, it was Greenspan, then-Bank of England Eddie George and Deutsche Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer saving global markets. After Southeast Asia crashed in late 1990s, Greenspan’s posse even made the cover of Time magazine as the “Committee to Save the World.” Around that time, when the ironically named hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management imploded, they saved the day again. In 2008, when Lehman Brothers did the same, the central-banking cavalry rode to the rescue. Since Covid-19 hit, these unelected economists have been our saviors, our therapists, our priests and now our lightning rods. Not to defend Orr here, but what did governments expect abdicating virtually all responsibility to a handful of unelected math enthusiasts would get us? Since the 1990s, a succession of elected officials from West to East, from North to South, had scope to build more inclusive, less volatile economic systems with safety nets and guardrails. Most chose instead to fob off the hard decisions to central bankers. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before the House Budget ...

Orr’s counterpart in Washington is about to have his own moment in the spotlight as President Joe Biden mulls whether to replace Powell. Is Orr correct to object to parliament’s change to RBNZ’s mandate? As he put it in December: “Adding house prices to the monetary policy objective would be unique internationally, which could make monetary policy less effective and impact financial market efficiency.”  Economists are debating this topic as we speak. But lawmakers could easily slap taxes on real estate transactions, limit leverage, demand higher down payments, ban foreign purchases or multiple property purchases by anyone or impose any number of so-called macroprudential speed bumps. Why risk angering the public, though, when central banks can to the dirty work? This abdication of responsibility is now a bubble all its own. True to form, the RBNZ is getting there first.

"Kevin Tan, president and CEO of MREIT, poses for a portrait in Manila, the Philippines, on June 21, ... [+] 2019.  Megaworld—controlled by billionaire Andrew Tan—has lowered the initial public offering price and size of its office real estate investment trust, reducing IPO proceeds to 15.3 billion pesos ($307 million) as investors seek higher yields. MREIT will sell up to 949.8 million shares, including an overallotment option, at 16.10 pesos a piece, Megaworld said Friday in a statement to the Philippine Stock Exchange. When Megaworld announced the IPO in June, the company said it plans to raise a maximum of 27.3 billion pesos from the maiden share sale of up to 1.24 billion shares for as much as 22 pesos each. “The company has decided to price the deal at an attractive level to provide more upside to IPO investors who will be its long-term partners in this new journey,” MREIT President and CEO Kevin Tan said in a statement. Kevin—the eldest son of Megaworld founder and chairman Andrew Tan—is also the chief strategy officer of Megaworld. MREIT’s yield would have been at the 4% level if the company priced the IPO at the original indicative price, said Noel Reyes, chief investment officer at Security Bank’s trust and asset management group. “That’s way too low to attract investors,” he said by email. With the lower price, MREIT said it is offering investors an attractive yield of 5.65% for the year ending June 30, 2022. That compares with 5.7% for RL Commercial REIT, which is listing next Tuesday, and about 6.1% for Filinvest REIT, which listed last month and declared its first dividend of 0.112 pesos per share last week.   Tan said they structured MREIT to deliver fast growth and strong aftermarket performance. “At the current issue size, the institutional tranche was close to two times oversubscribed, which bodes well for aftermarket performance.”  Apart from its attractive dividend yield, Tan said MREIT will provide investors exposure to high quality and fast-growing portfolio of assets. Megaworld injected a portfolio of ten office, retail and hotel assets with an aggregate gross leasable area of 224,430 square meters into MREIT. These properties—located in Megaworld’s townships near the Makati central business district, suburban Quezon City and Iloilo City in central Philippines—are primarily leased to business process outsourcing, or call center companies, according to MREIT. Megaworld, which will retain a 62.5% stake in MREIT, plans to inject five additional office towers with a combined gross floor area of 94,000 square meters into MREIT next year, Tan said at a virtual media briefing on Tuesday as the book building process for MREIT’s IPO started. By 2030, Tan expects MREIT to have a total gross floor area of 1 million square meters. With Megaworld adding more office towers into MREIT, Reyes said MREIT’s yield will rise to the 6% levels by 2023. The growth of MREIT looks achievable considering the pipeline of additional properties Megaworld can inject into and the weighted average lease expiry of these assets at 4.7 years, the highest among existing REITs, he added.  MREIT will start trading on the Philippine bourse on September 30. It will be the fifth REIT to list in the country since Ayala Land’s AREIT made its market debut as the nation’s first REIT in August 2020. Megaworld, which was founded by Tan over 30 years ago, has been developing townships in the past two decades and claims to be the largest office landlord in the country, with around 1.4 million square meters of office properties across 10 major cities in the country.  Tan, 69, was ranked the eighth-richest Filipino with a net worth of $2.6 billion when the ranking of the Philippines’ 50 richest people was published this week.

"Ghastly. Courtesy of Ghastly.  David Crow, known mononymously as Ghastly, transcends stylistic borders as he produces everything from heavy hitters to future bass and deep house. Today, September 10, the multifaceted creative further showcases his genre-smashing sound with “Vibe.” The future house and future bass banger, Crow says, was created unintentionally: the artist’s friend was curious about music production software Ableton and how to make music. Crow started with a new track to show him, and during the creation process, the producer says he realized the record had potential to be a Ghastly song. Thus, the anthemic record was made. “And then, it all came together,” Crow says. “That seems to be when the best art happens, right? When someone is doing it, not with the intention of making the best art, but just to create.” According to the genre-defying producer, he aims to tell stories through his music, which is seen on his recent release, “Burner,” as it recounts him speaking with a Burning Man attendee. “Burner” is particularly notable as it features Crow’s vocals—something he rarely adds to his work. Despite which genre the artist produces, his sound is easily identifiable to some as a Ghastly song, which he attributes to all music having a “fingerprint.”  “When you write music,” he says, “everyone has a fingerprint, and then so long as you're writing from the heart or you're writing from the soul, it's always going to have a piece of you in the audio. I very firmly believe that whatever emotion you're feeling goes into the song, whatever intention you're putting into it always adds something that you can't really...it's not tangible.” Ghastly performing at Beyond Wonderland.

If he were to be a character from any horror movie, the producer says he would be Paimon from the movie “Hereditary,” since the dormant demon awakens at the end of the movie to find itself as the leader of a cult. However, comedies have been Crow's go-to movies as of late, as he believes the switch allows him to view life through a more positive lens.  When asked which artist has had the biggest impact on the music he makes today, Crow immediately answers Aphex Twin. Without hesitation, he details how the legendary producer has influenced his sound: “One thing I've always loved about him is that he literally makes the most beautiful stuff you've ever heard and some of the most demented s*** you've ever heard. I relate so deeply to that, because he lists his full scale of emotions in his music. That's something that I think is very rare in a lot of electronic production, because everyone has [their] exact sound.” The ability to emulate his emotions in music, Crow says, is something he learned from Aphex Twin.  Looking forward, fans can expect a new project by Crow that boasts a very different sound from his Ghastly project, including showcasing more of his vocals. “It's just been very relieving to finally open up my mouth and start singing and just say what I have on my mind,” Crow says. “It's hard to say what you have on your mind with [electronic music].”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakocay/2021/09/10/ghastly-brings-pure-dance-floor-elation-with-vibe-single/,Ghastly Brings Pure Dance Floor Elation With ‘Vibe’ Single
"From left to right: AC Slater and Bleu Clair.  Night Bass label boss AC Slater and groovy house tastemaker Bleu Clair join forces for “Green Light (feat. Kate Wild),” which dropped August 13. The piano house record boasts elevated vocals, infectious bass lines, upbeat sounds and playful synths. Indeed “Green Light” proves to be an anthemic track designed for pure dance floor euphoria. Here, AC Slater and Bleu Clair took the time to speak with Forbes about “Green Light,” how they crossed paths in Jakarta in 2018, which artists have made the biggest impact on the music they make and more.  This transcript has been edited for clarity. Lisa Kocay: Can you tell me about your single together, “Greenlight”? AC Slater: “We talked about doing a [collaboration]. I had this kind of piano riff thing—a little rough idea.  I sent it over to him, and he put his little Bleu Clair magic on it with the cool drums, everything, the disco stabs and just spiced it up a bit. Then I was just like, ‘Wow, that was quick and easy.’ It was such a good groove. We really wanted to get vocals on it, so we got Kate Wild, who wrote and performed all the vocals, and she absolutely killed it. It literally came out so well. We just fine tuned it a little bit. It was actually out of a lot of the [collaborations] I've done, probably one of the easiest. Usually it's not so smooth.” Bleu Clair: “It was quick, though. I think we didn't take up more than two weeks.”  AC Slater: “We were mostly waiting for it because I just had a baby kind of around the same time, so it was more like me finding the time to work on it. So he did it pretty quick. Once we got the vocals, he took the vocals first and then gave them back to me. It was pretty quick—like pretty fast. I think it's such a cool piano house vibe, but I think it's really unique compared to a lot of the other traditional sort of piano house [music]. It's got a bit of edge to it, it's a bit rougher but still happy and bouncy—really, really different, but familiar at the same time.” AC Slater. Courtesy of Helen Perez. Kocay: How did you two initially get connected? I know you said that you two had been talking about doing a collaboration, but was there a specific thing that sparked the idea of collaborating together? AC Slater: “I don't remember. I've been playing his music for like the past year. I was doing a lot of Twitch streams, and I was getting promos and stuff. I was just really into his music.” Bleu Clair: “We started talking when you followed my Twitter, and we started talking on [direct message]. I sent you some music, and then we ended up making a track together.”  AC Slater: “So I just [direct messaged] him, so [it was] pretty organic. The crazy thing about us collaborating is really wild. So I played in Jakarta in 2018 at this club called...what was it called?”  Bleu Clair: “FABLE.” AC Slater: “FABLE. Even like here at that time, my style of deejaying was pretty popular, but not as big as certain places in America or in the world—like that style was not that popular. So I didn't know what to expect going into Indonesia to play in Jakarta. It was cool, the club was good and everything. But it was definitely not like...you could maybe confirm that it was not the most popular type of music in Jakarta. I was there and my wife was there with me, and it was a bit intimidating. Jakarta is a huge, super mega city—like super packed and intense. We were just kind of like, ‘There's a lot going on.’ We get to the club, and it was pretty good. But the thing that really made the show memorable for me was these two guys in the front just like going absolutely ape s***. It was Bleu Clair, and this other guy, OOTORO, who has also signed some records to my Night Bass, my label.  “So I have videos on my phone of [Bleu Clair], like rocking out and singing along. And he has a picture of us together after the show. It's just wild to me that now, three-and-a-half years later, [we’re] together and we're on the other side of the planet—and it's just so cool.”  Bleu Clair: “I've been a really big fan of AC Slater for a really long time. It's so crazy that now I'm doing a collaboration with him and actually working with him. It feels crazy.”  AC Slater: “It feels crazy, but it feels so natural. It just fell into place like that, which doesn't always happen. I think Bleu Clair's on a huge moment right now, which is really nice. So it's cool, man. It's just really cool the way things work sometimes: how he was a fan, but I was a fan of him being a fan. I specifically remember it and he didn't say anything, but OOTORO mentioned it to me and I was like, ‘Oh yeah. I literally remembered your face.’ So I went to my phone and started looking at that date range, and I found all these videos and stuff that my wife took, and he was right there in the front.”  Bleu Clair: “I looked a little bit different three-and-a-half years ago. I [had] really long hair and a man bun. I was surprised that Aaron [AC Slater] still actually recognized me with that drastic change of my look. I was a little bit f***ed up that night.”  AC Slater: “Having fun. As a DJ, sometimes it's when you go somewhere for the first time, especially because I’m from [North] America, so Jakarta is so different, you know? So there's nothing familiar, especially if the crowd isn't super into it. They're there and they're enjoying it, but you're used to a crazier crowd. But to see a couple of people that are making you feel very welcome and happy, and it goes both ways, so that's why it was so memorable. It's my only time there.” Bleu Clair. Courtesy of Bleu Clair. Kocay: Which artist has had the biggest impact on the music you make?  AC Slater: “I've been deejaying for 20 years or so, so my influences go way back. It's a wide range of influences, but probably one of my biggest influences would be the Chemical Brothers. I grew up listening to even old rave music: Prodigy and all that kind of stuff. Fast forward up to the 2000s with Crookers and Switch, and people with the fidget sound. I love a lot of bass line, U.K. Garage music—just like a nice mix of stuff. I've always been into U.K. music mostly, even the beginnings of dubstep and all of that stuff. So I definitely have a wide range of influences, but it's hard to kind of nail down one for me, like one specific person, but I would say probably Switch had my modern version—like kind of what I became in the past 10 years. I would say probably Switch as a producer was probably one of the most inspirational artists I was ever into, for sure.”  Bleu Clair: “For me I guess, I listen to a lot of different genres in electronic music, but the one that got me into producing is definitely Skrillex. That was when I heard his My Name Is Skrillex EP. If there's no Skrillex, then there’s no Bleu Clair. Period.”  AC Slater: “He's definitely the entry point, because that era when he came up, millions of new fans came into dance music. He was one of the dudes, and he's just incredibly talented. He changed the game.” Kocay: If you could go back in time to when you first started making music and give yourself one piece of advice, what would it be? AC Slater: “I would say patience. I guess I had patience, but keep the patience because you always learn. And when you think you know what you need to do, when you think you know what your goal is, you don't really know yet. I feel like in a music career, you never stop gaining wisdom. When you think you know everything, you don't know s*** yet, because five years later you're going to know so much more. I would tell myself to just be patient, keep learning, find your own sounds. It takes time. That's the hardest part: living the life long enough to kind of gain a bigger view of the goals you want to achieve, because everyone's different. It's easy to get frustrated, and I think if you want that, what someone else has and what you think you want, you don't even know what you want yet.” Bleu Clair: “For me, I think, try to be original because back then when I first started producing, I was trying hard to be Tchami. I was trying hard to be like Jauz. I was trying hard to be like Chris Lorenzo, but it ended up like me doing [something] completely similar to their tracks. The best thing that I could do is I could only be the second best of their version. My advice is just try to be original.”  AC Slater: “And that's great advice, because I get a lot of demos for Night Bass and my biggest issue is that people...it's kind of like a combination of what he said and what I said where it's people who just start, they try to emulate their influences, like identical. And it's cool when you get those tracks, because they're like, ‘Oh, this sounds good.’  We already have a Taiki Nulight, or we already have a Chris Lorenzo. Bleu Clair has a sound you know. He went through that process already of trying to sound like other people, and you have to find your way. It's not easy. Some people maybe just start in their original [sound], but that's very rare. But he went through it, I went through it, everybody goes through it. So he now has a very unique sound that other people...you know how many demos I get sound like Bleu Clair? It's crazy, and I'm just like, ‘All right, well, Bleu Clair already exists.’ So I think what you said is so on point, and it's so important, because we got to keep this music moving forward. If everyone sounds the same, then it's not fun.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakocay/2021/09/10/in-conversation-ac-slater-and-bleu-clair-on-green-light/,In Conversation: AC Slater And Bleu Clair On ‘Green Light’
"Support for marriage between Black and white people in the United States is nearly universal, with an all-time high 94% of Americans saying they approve, according to a poll released by Gallup on Friday. In the summer of 1967, a total of 16 states had not yet repealed anti-miscegenation laws that ... [+] prohibited interracial marriages.  According to Gallup, which has been surveying American's views on interracial marriage for more than six decades, the previous high was an 87% approval rate in 2013. When Gallup first asked the question, in 1958, just 4% approved and 94% disapproved. In previous decades, there were significant regional and generational differences of opinion. As recently as 1991, only 33% of adults in the South approved of interracial marriage; that number stood at 93% in Thursday's poll.  Similarly, only 27% of Americans over the age of 50 supported interracial marriage in 1991 — now more than 90% do. The poll was conducted from July 6-21 among 1,007 adults in all 50 states.  In 1958, the same year Gallup first queried Americans on their beliefs regarding interracial marriage, Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, exchanged wedding vows with Richard Loving, a white man, in Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal. However, when the couple returned home to Caroline County, Virginia, they were charged with unlawfully ""cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,"" as interracial marriage was deemed in violation of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The Lovings were charged with a felony, found guilty, and sentenced to a year in jail. The couple initially appealed their conviction to the Supreme Court of Virginia, but the state's ruling was upheld. They then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear their case. In June of 1967, in a unanimous decision, the Court decided in the Lovings favor, overturning their convictions. It ruled that the antiquated Virginia statutes had no legitimate purpose ""independent of invidious racial discrimination."" Loving v. Virginia not only struck down Virginia's anti-miscegenation law but also ended all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the U.S. In the summer of 1967, a total of 16 states had not yet repealed anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting interracial marriages.  ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State,"" wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1967.  An international Gallup poll taken in 1968 found that opposition to interracial marriage was far greater in the U.S than in other nations. More than 70% of Americans disapproved of white-nonwhite marriages, in contrast with only 25% of residents in France, 23% in the Netherlands, and 21% of residents in Sweden. Approval of interracial marriage didn't reach a majority level in the U.S. until 1997.

"The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol said Thursday it has obtained a vast trove of documents from federal agencies as part of its wide-reaching investigation of both the Capitol riot and the events surrounding it. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 27: Members of the House select committee investigating the deadly pro-Trump ... [+] invasion of the U.S. Capitol meet in a room ahead of the first hearing in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, July 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. During its first hearing, the committee - which currently made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - will hear testimony from law enforcement officers about their experiences while defending the Capitol on January 6. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) A committee spokesperson told Forbes in a statement they have received “thousands of pages of documents” in response to their records requests to eight federal agencies, including the National Archives, the Department of Justice and the Pentagon. The requests, sent out on August 25, gave each agency just two weeks to hand over the requested records, but the spokesperson said Thursday the National Archives has “undertaken the process required by law for review of presidential records.” The panel is seeking records on everything from former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, as well as his mental state; to the communications of key Trump allies, former aides and lawmakers; to intelligence gathered prior to the attack. The spokesperson said the documents from federal agencies build on materials provided by other House committees that were investigating the attack before the select committee, which has emerged as the central investigation of the attack, was created. The committee has become a political lightning rod due in large part to its composition. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to seat Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), prompting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarty to pull his other three picks for the panel. The only two Republicans on the 9-member committee are Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), both Trump critics who were appointed by Pelosi. Republicans have railed against the committee, particularly Kinzinger and Cheney’s appointments, with some right-wingers calling for them to be ousted from the House GOP. A records preservation request made to 35 telecom companies that targets some GOP lawmakers has also stoked their ire.  Republicans, McCarthy said in a statement last month, “will not forget” if companies comply with the request. One House Republican is fundraising off of being targeted by the committee’s request to telecom companies. “Nancy Pelosi wants this email,” read the subject line of a fundraising email from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) campaign on Thursday, stating that the “Witch Hunt Committee” is targeting her because “members like me stood up for President Trump.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/10/jan-6-probe-obtains-thousands-of-pages-of-federal-agency-documents/,Jan. 6 Probe Obtains ‘Thousands’ Of Pages Of Federal Agency Documents
"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an erstwhile ally of former President Donald Trump, on Thursday tore into the ex-president’s political movement and baseless claims of election fraud, urging the Republicans to break with “the conspiracy theorists and the truth deniers” in their ranks. Trump’s once-trusted ally disparaged his cult of personality, all without saying his name, during ... [+] Thursday's speech (not pictured here) Christie said during an appearance at the Ronald Reagan Library that the GOP needs to “face the realities of the 2020 election and learn, not hide, from them,” urging fellow Republicans to “discredit the extremists in our midst.” Christie framed distancing from election conspiracy theorists as the politically favorable move for Republicans, arguing voters want to hear policy ideas and not “endless grievances.” The comments came as a clear rebuke of Trump, who has continued to baselessly suggest the election was stolen, leading many Republican lawmakers to follow suit and even launch audits to continue adjudicating the election nearly a year later. Christie compared Trump’s embrace of the GOP’s radical elements to 1964 GOP candidate Barry Goldwater’s hesitance to call out the conspiratorial John Birch Society because he “didn’t want to offend the base,” quipping, “When have we heard that before?” Christie also took aim at what is perceived as a cult of personality around Trump, arguing nobody is “worthy of blind faith or obedience” regardless of “what office they’ve held or wealth they’ve acquired,” urging the GOP not to “tie our future to a pile of lies.” Still, in what has become a theme for Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence and former House Speaker Paul Ryan seeking to distance from Trump while preserving their future political prospects, Christie avoided referencing Trump directly. Christie has had an unlikely alliance with Trump that lasted well into 2020. His early endorsement of Trump in 2016, shortly after ending his own presidential bid, helped burnish the then-outsider candidate’s credentials at a time when he was still distrusted by much of the GOP establishment. As recently as last fall, Christie assisted Trump with debate prep and attended a White House event to celebrate the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. More recently, Christie has been critical of Trump. After contracting coronavirus in October along with several other members of Trump’s debate prep team, which led to a week-long hospitalization, Christie said he should have worn a mask during debate prep and “shouldn’t have relied” on the White House’s assurances everyone at the Barrett event was tested. He also blasted Trump’s legal challenges to his 2020 election loss as a “national embarrassment.” Christie, who went from being widely regarded as a 2016 presidential frontrunner to crashing and burning in the early primaries, is considering another presidential bid in 2024. He said in a podcast interview in May he is “not going to defer to anyone” in making his decision on whether to run and won’t wait to see whether Trump mounts his own comeback bid.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/10/chris-christie-tells-gop-to-face-the-realities-of-trumps-loss-and-discredit-the-extremists/,Chris Christie Tells GOP To ‘Face The Realities’ Of Trump’s Loss And ‘Discredit The Extremists’
"'Pokémon The Movie: Secrets Of The Jungle' hits Netflix this October. It’s been a while since we heard anything about Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle, but now we have an updated trailer and news that it is also coming to Netflix. Released in Japan at the end of last year, the global release for Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle has taken its time.  Obviously, the current COVID situation hasn’t helped matters, but the fact that the movie is now finally on its way Westward is definitely good news. Set in the jungle, this new movie deals with the Mythical Pokémon called Zarude, that acts as a father figure to a young boy called Koko. The trailer (shown below) does also have somewhat Avatar vibes about it, as we get to see a giant tree and its life-giving spring under siege from greedy humans, with Ash and Pikachu trying to avert a disaster. I mean having a mecha try to destroy the jungle, only to have the likes of Pokémon Harambe save the day does look a tad silly. However, this is Pokémon so I am sure it will be thoroughly endearing and turn out great. Released on October 8 on Netflix, Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle will unleash the wrath of Pokémon Pandora upon the world. Follow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

"Getty Images Last month this column—along with the world’s capital markets—wondered why Beijing would hurt its own tech stars, such as Ant Financial, Didi Chuxing and TAL, with a barrage of new regulations. My thought was that President Xi Jinping was waving a red flag at China’s tech talent: Turn your attention away from splashy consumer tech: online loans, ride shares, tutoring games and the like. Get busy on strategically core technologies, for example, semiconductors. Xi’s bid for national self-sufficiency of at least 70% in critical tech by 2025 is bogged down by China’s weakness in this most strategic of all technologies. The Intel 4004, the world’s first microprocessor. A bit of history. Fifty years ago this November, America’s Intel laid the foundation of the digital era with the 4004, the world’s first microprocessor. The project had started in 1969 as a partnership with Japan’s Busicom, which had negotiated exclusive rights for the 4004 in calculators.  Intel kept the rights for other uses, which by the end of the 1970s would come to include the personal computer. The rest, as they say, is history. Intel, which both designs and manufactures chips, has never given up its overall global sales lead and enjoys the advantages of global scale. China gets semiconductors. It is the world’s second-largest consumer of semiconductors, a bit behind the U.S. and will soon catch up. But mainland China is miles behind the U.S. when it comes to making advanced microprocessors, which power everything from giant server farms to the world’s 5 billion mobile phones. Thus far, China’s major role in the semiconductor world has been that of assembler and packager. The absence of a mainland-based company from the top global semiconductor ranks is a strategic black hole for Beijing. Of the world’s top 15 semiconductor companies by sales, eight are in the U.S. Two each are located in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. Japan has one. Since semiconductors are the fourth-most traded product in the world (by value), behind crude oil, refined oil and cars, it is puzzling why China has not yet cracked the top 15. One assumes Xi knows this cannot stand if China is to achieve core technological independence by 2025. Mainland China’s semiconductor flagships are Shenzhen’s Huawei in design and Shanghai’s SMIC in contract manufacturing. Both compete on the world stage; neither has cracked the world’s top 15 in semiconductor sales. (Huawei, of course, like Apple, derives most of its sales from mobile phones, not chips.) Huawei is a world-class company, but its ability to tap into markets comprising the majority of the global GDP was restricted by the former Trump administration’s policies.  Signage of the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. at the company's headquarters in ... [+] Shanghai, China. Thus SMIC is China’s laggard in its race for core tech independence. As of 2020, SMIC’s global share of contract chip manufacturing was only 4%, compared to Samsung’s 18% and TSMC’s 50% (and for advanced chip manufacturing even more dominant at 80%). Most analysts believe SMIC to be three to four years behind TSMC’s technology. This gap has forced SMIC to compete more on a commodity level—cheap phones, appliances, cars and so on. What could bring SMIC into the top ranks? In a word, Huawei. The Shenzhen superstar has needed a top factory partner since Trump’s actions in 2020 restricted Samsung and TSMC from fully serving Huawei. China also will have to develop a world-class chip manufacturing equipment business. This is not trivial. Etching transistors onto silicon at 5 nanometer scale—a human hair width is around 90,000 nanometers—is a technological feat. Very few equipment companies can do it.  The investment needed to achieve Xi’s dream of core tech independence, just in semiconductors, is estimated to cost between $1 trillion to $3 trillion. But reaching that goal will take more than just money. It will take trust in the scientists, engineers, bold thinkers and mavericks, along with experimentation and creative finance required to make it happen. It can’t automatically happen by top-down command. Meanwhile, Intel, Samsung, TSMC and others are not sitting still.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2021/09/10/chinas-trillion-dollar-hurdle-to-crack-into-top-global-semiconductor-ranks/,China’s Trillion-Dollar Hurdle To Crack Into Top Global Semiconductor Ranks
"Adam Cole — along with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan — is helping shift the momentum in favor of AEW as ... [+] they continue to battle the WWE in the ratings war. As if AEW’s “All Out” PPV wasn’t proof enough, the ratings for the latest episode of Dynamite are in and the numbers are looking good. According to Wrestlenomics’ Brandon Thurston, the post-All Out episode of Dynamite delivered an overnight audience of 1.319 million viewers and 681,000 viewers in the 18-to-49 age demographic.  Not only are the total viewers the second-highest the show has ever drawn, the 681,000 viewers for the 18-to-49 demographic bests WWE’s latest Monday Night Raw edition, which drew 678,000 viewers in the same category. As mentioned in the graphic, Dynamite also drew a 0.53 rating in the 18-to-49 age demographic — a major boost to last week’s 0.38 rating. It’s worth mentioning that the Monday Night Raw episode was on Labor Day — a holiday that normally draws low ratings for WWE’s flagship show. However, this is still historic — because this is the first time Dynamite has ever defeated Raw in this key demographic. The Wednesday edition of Dynamite was AEW’s first episode after their widely-praised PPV, All Out. All Out featured the debuts of Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan, two former WWE superstars. The PPV also featured former WWE superstar CM Punk’s first match in over seven years. The debut of Cole as a heel with “The Elite” and Bryan’s debut as a babyface rival to “The Elite” stable after the main event of AEW’s recent PPV has drawn lofty comparisons. In fact, it’s being compared to the debuts of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash — the Outsiders and eventual founding members of the N.W.O — back in 1996 when WCW overtook the WWE in the Monday Night Ratings war. Hall and Nash’s defections from WWE to WCW would eventually lead to Monday Night Nitro defeating Monday Night Raw for two consecutive years in the ratings war from June of 1996 until April of 1998. While it remains to be seen if AEW can carry that ratings momentum moving forward, it’s clear that wrestling observers feel the same way. WWE legend and Hall-of-Famer Mick Foley released a video not long after AEW’s All Out PPV and said that his former employer has a problem — and it’s AEW. “Hello, this is ‘The Hardcore Legend’ Mick Foley. I’d like to title this video, ‘WWE – We’ve Got a Problem’ because I think you do and that problem is that WWE is no longer the place for talent to aspire to,” Foley began.  “Part of it is because AEW is doing a great job of attracting great talent, proven talent, building other talent, creating storylines, but part of it is a problem of your own making,” continued Foley. “I think younger talent sees the way that developmental characters are cut or left by the wayside, or in the case of Karrion Kross, greatly watered down and even made a joke of when they debut on the main roster. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Foley goes on to say that if you’re a wrestler looking to make an impact in the business, AEW — not WWE — is the way to go. “If I was an aspiring talent now, big league talent with a major decision to make, I’m not sure that I would trust WWE creative to do the right thing with my career,” says Foley. “You guys did wonders with me back in the day… that was a different time, different place. If it was today, I’m not sure I would trust the powers to be with my career in their hands, and until that changes, WWE – you’ve got a problem.” As much hoopla as there is surrounding AEW’s increasing ratings, the WWE’s ratings are not only consistent — they’ve been rising a bit. WWE’s most recent edition of Friday Night Smackdown — which is aired on the broadcast network FOX, a big advantage over Dynamite’s cable partner, TNT — posted 2.220 million viewers and 805,000 viewers in the 18-to-49 age demographic. While the overall viewers are slightly down from the previous week’s post-Summerslam episode viewership of 2.250 million viewers, the viewership for the key demographic spiked 5.37 percent from 764,000 viewers. This week’s episode of Smackdown will feature the return of Brock Lesnar, which should continue WWE’s own momentum for their Friday night show. While WWE isn’t going out of business any time soon, AEW has momentum — and it’s clearly showing in the ratings. The talk of the wrestling community has centered around AEW as of late. It’ll be interesting to see how WWE reacts now that AEW is finally matching the dominant wrestling brand’s flagship cable show in the ratings war.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2021/09/10/aew-clearly-has-all-of-the-momentum-in-wrestling-war-with-wwe/,AEW Clearly Has All Of The Momentum In Wrestling War With WWE
"Food delivery platforms Doordash, Grubhub and Uber Eats sued New York City late on Thursday over legislation that permanently places a cap on fees and commissions the platforms can charge restaurants using their services, marking the latest clash between a local government and the platforms which grew significantly during the pandemic. Food delivery companies can charge upto a 30% commission per order from restaurants using their ... [+] platforms. According to the Wall Street Journal, the case was filed in a New York federal court late on Thursday and it argues that the capping of fees is harmful and constitutes government overreach. The food delivery companies are seeking an injunction that would prevent the city from continuing to enforce the law along with unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial. The apps—which have seen massive growth during the pandemic—argue that New York’s permanent fee caps bear “no relationship to any public-health emergency” as restaurants are allowed to operate their dining rooms again.  The food delivery platforms can charge as high as a 30% commission per order from restaurants and the New York City legislation caps that at no more than 23%—15% for delivery, 5% for listing and advertising and 3% for credit-card processing fees. In the suit, the companies argue that the fee cap is unconstitutional as it “interferes with freely negotiated contracts between platforms and restaurants by changing and dictating the economic terms on which a dynamic industry operates,” Reuters reported. Unlike the rest of the country where Doordash dominates with a 57% national market share, all three apps are almost evenly matched in New York. According to Bloomberg Second Measure, Doordash made up 36% of food delivery sales in the city in July while GrubHub and UberEats’ share stood at 34% and 29% respectively. Last month, the New York City Council approved legislation that placed a cap on the amount food delivery companies can charge restaurants on their platform and required them to obtain licenses to operate in the city which would have to be renewed every two years. The legislation came into force after the city had imposed temporary caps on fees and commissions during the pandemic—when restaurants were forced to heavily rely on delivery services as restrictions were placed on dining. Other major cities have begun regulating the platforms as well, including San Francisco which enacted a permanent 15% cap per order on food-delivery fees in June. The city is also being legally challenged by the platforms. The city of Chicago filed two lawsuits against Grubhub and Doordash last month, accusing the company of deceptive advertising, lack of transparency on fees charged to customers and adding restaurants to their platform without their consent.

"Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers illustrated why they're still the favorites in their ... [+] season-opening win over the Dallas Cowboys in the 2021 NFL season opener. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) If you had any doubt the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were still the team to beat entering the 2021 NFL season, those doubts were likely erased after Thursday night. The Buccaneers knocked off a resilient Dallas Cowboys squad, 31-29, as they kicked off their quest to repeat as the defending champions. Despite Dak Prescott showing no rust after a one-year layoff with a 400-yard, three-touchdown performance and the Cowboys absolutely dominating on the stat sheet — one turnover to Tampa’s four and over 34 minutes in time of possession — the Buccaneers walked away with a season-opening win. If there was any question that a 44-year-old Tom Brady would slow down this year, that idea quickly went out the window. Brady threw four touchdowns, including calmly leading the game-winning 57-yard drive in the last minute of the game. He demonstrated pinpoint precision and timing on his passes, including the biggest play of the game on this 24-yard pass to Chris Godwin on the Buccaneers’ final drive of the game. Time and time again, the ageless Brady — the oldest quarterback to start a game since a 44-year-old Steve DeBerg started for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998 — got the ball out quickly and did it with his classic precision in tight coverage. Despite an imperfect night by the offense — the Buccaneers didn’t commit four turnovers in a single game last year — and the defensive unit being repeatedly gashed by Prescott and his high-powered Cowboys offensive unit, Tampa Bay still won. That means despite winning the turnover battle, the time of possession battle and the quarterback battle, the Cowboys still couldn’t knock off the Buccaneers. That’s a very worrisome sign for the rest of the NFL. The Cowboys may not be considered one of the elite teams in the league, but they are one of the most talented. While kicker Greg Zuerlein did cost the team seven points — and ultimately the game — with his missed kicks, the Cowboys almost executed the perfect game plan to defeat the Buccaneers. However, this game demonstrated the clear difference between a very good team and the best one. The Cowboys had multiple opportunities to run away in this game. The Buccaneers’ own self-inflicted turnovers combined with the Cowboys’ passing dominance repeatedly led Dallas into scoring position — only for the team to fumble away opportunities with stupid plays, or just a simple lack of aggressiveness in the red zone. Dallas had four opportunities in the red zone and scored a touchdown just once at a 25 percent clip. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers scored touchdowns on three of their five red zone opportunities at a 60 percent clip. That was the difference in this game in a nutshell: touchdowns win championships — not field goals. Brady threw two interceptions, but neither were his fault. On a screen pass to running back Leonard Fournette, the ball bobbled off of his hands into a Cowboys defender. On Brady’s other interception, a Hail Mary pass at the end of the first half resulted in a turnover. While Prescott’s interception had more to do with CeeDee Lamb’s drop than the quarterback himself, he did throw into heavy traffic with three Buccaneers defenders surrounding the area. That turnover resulted in tremendous field position — Tampa Bay started at the Dallas 35-yard line — and an eventual touchdown to give the Bucs a nine-point lead. Bad plays happen every now and then when you’re attempting to be aggressive on offense. So that pass to Lamb — which the receiver should have never dropped — is understandable. But the play that really cost the Cowboys was towards the end of the first half when Prescott took a 12-yard sack that put the team out of field goal range. Instead of scrambling and holding onto the ball, Prescott should have simply thrown the ball out of bounds. A holding penalty on the next play forced Dallas into attempting a 60-yard field goal, which they missed. That’s three missed points right there and the game. That’s a mistake Brady doesn’t make. As good as Prescott will be this season and as improved as the Cowboys will be, this game was the perfect embodiment of the separation that the Buccaneers have created between themselves and the rest of the league. If all 22 of the Buccaneers’ returning starters remain relatively healthy entering the postseason, are we really going to doubt Brady will lead them to a repeat in the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl still runs through Tampa. This game was a harsh reminder of that for the rest of the NFL.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2021/09/10/tampa-bay-buccaneers-prove-theyre-still-team-to-beat-following-season-opening-win/,Tampa Bay Buccaneers Prove They’re Still Team To Beat With Season-Opening Win Over Cowboys
"Japan’s Olympus Corp. is synonymous with cameras. From its earliest camera in 1936, Olympus built a reputation for quality and innovation, such as its 1971 model 35DC, the world’s first camera with an automatic flash. Yet that storied legacy came to an end in January, when Olympus finalized the sale of its camera and voice recorder businesses to Tokyo-based private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners for an undisclosed amount. “I have [had] a longtime ambition to really change this company,” says president and CEO Yasuo Takeuchi in an interview at the company’s Tokyo headquarters. It was a bold shedding of a signature business built up over eight decades. Without cameras, what’s next for Olympus? Takeuchi’s answer: “We have a very good business on the medical side.” Takeuchi is now overseeing Olympus’ most extensive corporate makeover in its 102-year history, with the aim to create a pure-play medical technology (medtech) giant. Olympus endoscopes can be used for diagnosis and endoscopic treatments. This pivot takes Olympus back to its roots. While renowned for its cameras, Olympus has a long and parallel history in medical technology, using its optical expertise to make microscopes and endoscopes. In fact, the first product released by Olympus was a microscope, launched just six months after the company’s founding in 1919. Then came endoscopes—Olympus created in 1950 what it dubbed a “gastrocamera,” a device, while rudimentary, laid the basis for modern endoscopes.  Building on that expertise, Olympus says it is the world’s largest maker of gastrointestinal endoscopes, commanding 70% of the $3.3 billion global market for this technology. In the last fiscal year that included cameras (ended March 2020), the company’s two medtech divisions contributed 80% of ¥797 billion ($7.3 billion) in total revenues. The imaging division, which holds cameras, represented just 6% in sales and lost over $1 billion over the previous decade. Now that Takeuchi has jettisoned cameras, the microscope division may be next—as it will be transferred into a wholly owned subsidiary in 2022. All told, Takeuchi is on track to complete Olympus’ realignment to a company focused on endoscopes, therapeutic treatments and surgical technologies by the end of next year.  The reason for this transformation is simple—smartphone cameras have decimated the consumer camera market, negating demand for stand-alone cameras. As for microscopes, now that imaging is gone, this division has become the company’s smallest business, representing 13% of total ¥731 billion in revenues in the latest fiscal year (ended March 31). Olympus has a long history in medical technology, using its optical expertise to make microscopes and endoscopes. Takeuchi, 64, has followed a tradition of many Japanese to pursue lifetime employment in a single company. He joined Olympus in 1980 as a fresh 23-year-old business graduate from Japan’s Chuo University. He rose up through the ranks, spending 16 years outside Japan, helping run Olympus’ operations in Europe and the U.S. He then returned to Japan in 2015 to head the corporate management office, becoming chief financial officer a year later. From there he moved into the CEO spot in April 2019—taking the post just months before the 100th anniversary of the company’s founding in October 1919. Now his challenge will be to lead Olympus into its second century, helming a company much different from the one at which he spent four decades.  The results of Olympus’ restructuring are bearing fruit. Since Takeuchi unveiled the company’s “Transform Olympus” restructuring plan in January 2019, its Tokyo-listed stock has doubled to recent levels around ¥2,200. In the first quarter of the current financial year that began April 1, revenue jumped 40% from a year earlier to ¥191.5 billion ($1.8 billion). Olympus swung to an ¥18.7 billion net profit from a ¥2.7 billion loss a year earlier, prompting the management to forecast a full-year profit of ¥101 billion—which, if achieved, would be the largest in its history. While the pandemic had little effect on Olympus’ restructuring process, it did hurt demand for its medical equipment amid slowing economic growth in many of its markets and people putting off non-emergency medical procedures like checkups (its products aren’t used in treating Covid-19). Olympus now sees signs of rebound. In the fiscal year through March, “we faced unprecedented challenges caused by Covid-19. Despite these, revenue recovered significantly toward the second half of the year,” said Takeuchi in a conference call in May with analysts.  Source: Olympus Corp., regulatory filings The catalyst for Olympus’ restructuring is said to have come from U.S. activist fund ValueAct Capital, a San Francisco-based firm with a reported $16 billion under management and which has initiated actions against companies such as Microsoft and Rolls-Royce. When ValueAct emerged as the owner of a 5% stake in 2018, alarm bells went off at Olympus. In response, the company hired consultants who advised Takeuchi, then chief financial officer, not to talk to the hedge fund. Takeuchi balked at that advice. “I felt instinctively that they might be able to become a very good partner,” he says.  Ignoring the consultants, Takeuchi became the company’s liaison with ValueAct. According to a media report, ValueAct in December 2018 threatened to call an extraordinary shareholder meeting to replace the directors unless the company inducted three non-Japanese onto its board. While the fund at the time denied making this threat, in January 2019 Olympus announced ValueAct partner Robert Hale would sit on its board and be joined by ValueAct advisor Jimmy Beasley. Today they are two of the three Olympus directors who aren’t Japanese nationals. (ValueAct declined to comment for this article.) Takeuchi downplays questions about external pressure, saying that ValueAct’s advice complemented the blueprint that he had started hammering out about five years ago with other executives, including the former CEO Hiroyuki Sasa. “I don’t think that’s exactly true,” he says, when asked about pressure for a board revamp. But if there was any nuance like that, he says, it was at the beginning of the relationship. “They didn’t know who we were, how we were going to manage this company and how we [would] react to their approaches,” he says. In January 2021, two years after Olympus announced its transformation plan, the fund sold down its investment. It now holds a 4% stake.  Kaufmann (left) says of the restructuring under Takeuchi: “We now have a chance to focus much more on becoming the leading global medtech company that we want to be.” Masahiro Nakanomyo, a Tokyo-based analyst at U.S. financial group Jefferies, feels the changes would have occurred even without ValueAct because Takeuchi had already decided to focus on the medical business, unlike his predecessors who were more cautious in letting go of the legacy camera business. “Even if there was no gaiatsu [foreign pressure], they would have done the spinoff of the camera business,” Nakanomyo says. “What Takeuchi-san and ValueAct were thinking was in the same direction, so there’s no conflict.”   Takeuchi also instituted board changes, increasing the number of outside directors to nine out of 12 from six in the previous 11-member board, and setting up committees for nomination, compensation and compliance chaired by an external director. The “Transform Olympus” drive also led to the creation of a five-member global executive committee headed by Takeuchi and including Stefan Kaufmann, chief administrative officer for Olympus. A German citizen who has worked at Olympus since 2003, Kaufmann has been given responsibility to oversee the implementation of the plan.  Takeuchi has also streamlined decision-making. Previously, any major corporate decision could involve as many as 15 people, including directors and senior executives, causing bottlenecks and delays in getting things done. Take the company’s X1 endoscope launched last year. The product took eight years to develop, double the time taken by industry rivals to create new endoscopes. Eight years is too long, Kaufmann says. Olympus says it is the world’s largest maker of gastrointestinal endscopes, commanding 70% of the $3.3 billion global market.  But now more authority is delegated to product and divisional heads, according to Takeuchi. Instead of overseas executives having to route decisions through a counterpart in Japan, divisions are now organized by function rather than regions. “This has improved agility by multiple times,” says Kaufmann. Olympus also encourages a “two in a box” decision-making process that teams up one Japanese and one foreign national, says chief operating officer Nacho Abia, who hails from Spain. He is based not in Tokyo but Marlborough, Massachusetts. “The quality of the decisions was much better than before,” he says.  Another change is in the research and development process. Rather than focus just on in-house research, says Kaufmann, the company is more open to acquisitions to speed up development—and has made a string of purchases in the last few years, including firms in France, Israel and the U.S.  With the restructuring, more analysts have upgraded their ratings. Vaccination progress in the U.S., Europe and China is leading to a sharp recovery in medical equipment sales, wrote Daiwa Securities analyst Tomoko Yoshihara in a May note. The Tokyo-based brokerage expects Olympus’ net profit to climb to ¥143 billion in the year ending March 2025, up 42% from the company’s forecast for the current fiscal year, on nearly ¥959 billion revenue. “As it continues to pursue business model improvements through the ‘Transform Olympus’ plan, the firm should be able to achieve sustained improvement in profitability going forward,” she wrote. China is also a source of new demand and could soon displace Europe as the company’s second-largest market (North America remains its largest). “China has been growing by more than double digits in the past several years and that will continue,” Takeuchi says. “A country like India, like many Asian countries that have big populations, is totally underdeveloped” in terms of healthcare and as a market, he adds. Kaufmann offers his personal perspective on the company’s evolution: “We now have a chance to focus much more on becoming the leading global medtech company that we want to be.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jsimms/2021/09/09/japans-olympus-aims-to-become-global-medtech-leader-after-exiting-cameras/,Japan's Olympus Aims To Become Global Medtech Leader After Exiting Cameras
"Emma Raducanu, of Great Britain, returns a shot to Maria Sakkari, of Greece, during the semifinals ... [+] of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Two teenagers have taken over the women’s draw and captivated the crowd at the U.S. Open. Shortly after 19-year-old Leylah Annie Fernandez of Canada earned her place in Saturday’s women’s championship match, 18-year-old Brit Emma Raducanu stormed her way in with a 6-1, 6-4 destruction of No. 17 Maria Sakkari of Greece. Raducanu, who was already the first qualifier in the Open Era to reach the semifinals, has now won nine straight matches — including qualifying — without dropping a set. She is the first qualifier — male or female — ever to reach a Grand Slam final. “Honestly, the time here in New York has just gone so fast, I’ve just been taking care of each day and before you know it I’m in the final and I can’t actually believe it,” she told ESPN’s Rennae Stubbs on court. “Thanks for everyone.” Whoever wins on Saturday will have come from virtually nowhere to earn a place as a Grand Slam champion while picking up a $2.5 million paycheck. The runner-up takes home $1.25 million. The two teenagers know one another from the juniors, where Raducanu won 6-4, 6-4 in the Wimbledon juniors a few years back. “I mean, is there any expectation?” she said with a laugh. “Technically I’m a qualifier so there’s no pressure on me.” Maria Sakkari, of Greece, chases down a shot from Emma Raducanu, of Great Britain, during the ...

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Raducanu could not have guessed when qualifying began that she would be one of the final two women standing. “I didn't expect to be here at all. I mean, I think my flights were booked at the end of qualifying, so it's a nice problem to have,” the world No.150 admitted with a smile. But she is playing like she belongs. Raducanu won the first five games of the match en route to a quick first set. Playing with poise that belied her age, she got an early break in the second set and held serve to take a 5-3 lead when Sakkari smacked a forehand wide. Serving at 5-4, she earned a match point with a forehand deep to Sakkari’s backhand that the Greek returned into the net. On match point, she came into net and hit a swinging forehand volley winner before dropping her racket in disbelief and then smiling and waving to the crowd. She finished with four aces and 15 winners against 17 unforced errors. Raducanu took inspiration from British great Tim Henman, who was in the crowd and has been telling her to “stay present” and “not get ahead of herself.” “I’m really grateful for Tim and everything he’s done for me,” she said. With Serena and Venus Williams, Rafael Nadal (foot) and Roger Federer (knee) all sidelined this year due to injuries, these youngsters are winning fans and making headlines in one of the most exciting Opens in recent memory. “What this tournament was going to struggle with was sort of the buzz factor, the it factor, the entertainment value,” Patrick McEnroe said on ESPN. “The tennis was going to be at a high level no matter what, but the players, particularly those younger players, with the help of these fans, have taken it to a whole other level. They’ve really embraced it. “It’s been awesome to watch them stepping up to the plate on the big stage, delivering great tennis and great entertainment and great sportsmanship as well.

"Country newcomer BRELAND is featured in Chevrolet’s new commercial for the Chevy Silverado ZR2 ... [+] alongside actor Chris Pratt and 2020 NASCAR Cup Champion Chase Elliott, which premiered tonight during the NFL Kickoff game on NBC.  Country newcomer BRELAND (real name Daniel Breland) is featured in Chevrolet’s new commercial for the 2022 Silverado ZR2 alongside actor Chris Pratt, 2020 NASCAR Cup Champion Chase Elliott and renowned off-road racer and engineer Chad Hall, which premiered tonight during the NFL Kickoff game on NBC. The singer continues his partnership with the brand, which began in February with the launch of Chevrolet’s TikTok channel featuring an updated version of his 2020 debut single, “My Truck.” A New Jersey native, BRELAND grew up singing in church, but it wasn’t until he performed an original song in high school that he decided to pursue a career in music. In college, he focused on writing songs and pitching them to other artists. After he graduated from Georgetown University, BRELAND moved to Atlanta and was working with R&B and hip-hop producers before ultimately finding his country-influenced sound. He relocated to Nashville in 2020. “Once I made ‘My Truck’ I felt like I had more of a mission, which is that I really want to bring a new perspective to country music,” he tells me. “I wanted to be able to add some new flavors and sounds to a genre that I think sometimes gets a bad rap for being very monochromatic.” BRELAND says he’s trying to bring people into the genre that wouldn’t normally listen to country music and hopes to open a cultural bridge between the hip-hop, R&B and country worlds. He describes his musical blend as cross country, which also is the title of his autobiographical tune featuring Mickey Guyton. “I think that inclusivity is going to bring about some really cool conversations and hopefully some unity, community and change,” he says. “The biggest roadblock is simply a roadblock of perspective and a roadblock of representation.  “I think there are a lot of people who might think that I shouldn't be doing this based on what I look like or what I sound like or where I’m from and that's just because the perspective that they have of country music is very narrow,” he continues. “All I really want to do in this space is to broaden that perspective and hopefully give people a new one where they can redefine country music as a genre that can be more inclusive.” BRELAND also is using his partnership with Chevy to spread this message of inclusivity and positivity. Following the success of “My Truck,” which was certified platinum by the RIAA, he says collaborating with Chevy was organic and made sense for both parties. In addition to building a cultural bridge with his music, he hopes his background can help the Chevy campaign do the same. “The future of truck culture and the future of truck owners is diverse and so this partnership makes sense from that perspective,” he explains. “What we're doing is a natural extension of what I'm already doing with my music and trying to bring more people into this space and make it more inclusive. I think that's what they're trying to do with their campaigns. I expect to see a lot of multicultural young truck owners driving around over the next few years and I’m excited to bring that into the world as well.” Just as his partnership with Chevy extends his brand, BRELAND’s collaborations with multiple artists showcase his versatility as an artist and as a songwriter. The singer is featured on Dierks Bentley’s current single “Beers On Me” with HARDY; on Rascal Flatts frontman Gary LeVox’s first gospel project with the soaring ballad “All I See”; Nelly’s country-influenced release “High Horse” with Blanco Brown; and newcomer Tiera’s “Miles.” “I have the freedom as a musical chameleon of sorts as a no genre artist to be able to use my voice in a lot of different ways so depending on the song, I can fill whatever void needs to be filled on these different collaborations,” he says. “Every feature I'm showcasing a different part of my creativity and bringing something different but it's cross country every time because it's all about the story that I'm telling. It's all about the way that I'm telling it and the word play that I'm putting into it.” After more than a decade of pursuing a career in music, BRELAND says the best business advice he has received is to align himself with companies and products that he believes in. For BRELAND, Chevy was exactly that. “I've had a chance to drive a Chevy truck for a little while now and they really are the best of the best,” he says. “I wouldn't have been able to do this if I did not believe that they made great trucks and didn't want to drive them myself, so I don't really have to act to do this commercial. It's not an act. They're the best of the best and I'm excited to be a part of it.” BRELAND is currently on his first headlining trek, the Cross Country Tour, which runs through October.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/anniereuter/2021/09/09/meet-breland-chevys-new-brand-ambassador-and-countrys-go-to-collaborator/,Meet BRELAND: Chevy’s New Brand Ambassador And Country’s Go-To Collaborator
"The Voyeurs What do you get if you take Rear Window and add a dash of sex, and another dash, and then accidentally dump the bottle in and you can’t do anything about it anymore? You get Michael Mohan’s The Voyeurs, a film that’s an extravagantly lustful yet contained erotic thriller that genuinely packs twists, turns, and a lot of heat into a thriller that ultimately works. Sydney Sweeney’s Pippa has just moved into a swanky open loft with an improbable view with her boyfriend Thomas (Justice Smith). Their relationship is golden, and they soon discover that the sexy neighbors across the way, Seb (Ben Hardy) and Julia (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) have tons of sex (well, Seb has sex with basically everyone, ever), and the pair become infatuated with spying on the neighbors. The pair acquire binoculars and an elaborate laser-using technique to spy on the neighbors’ audio (seriously; fun fact... that’s not the easiest way to spy on neighbors’ audio by a longshot), and it pulls them deeper in. Pippa, unsatisfied with the couple’s vanilla life, becomes the most infatuated. Infatuation becomes obsession, obsession becomes entanglement, entanglement becomes mess, and soon it spirals into lasting harms the couple can’t come back from. The story as a whole isn’t entirely original per se, but it packs enough twists and turns to carry the viewer along for an engaging ride. Sure, some of its plot turns make little sense in ways that can’t be discussed sans spoilers, but it’s fun and engaging enough and makes enough sense to by-and-large work. Most importantly, the whole thing positively drips with sexually hungry energy that’s so entwined with the story that it’s easy to be taken for a ride for anyone with a beating pulse.  Sydney Sweeney’s Pippa is the most engaging character in the ordeal, driven by Eros until it becomes a compulsion. She’s smart, sure, but she’s easily intoxicated by Seb’s allures under the guise of concern for Julia. It’s a great lead performance that really lands, while Ben Hardy’s Seb walks an intriguing tightrope of pure-Id-to-concerned-soul that definitely works for his particular part in the film. In the central four members of the main cast, they all give solid performances (though, admittedly, Justice Smith is woefully underused). The film boasts an effective if not simple cinematography—all within a voyeurs' eye, one that makes one feel dirty as the characters do, or should. The plot as a whole is a solid escalation of tension until the truly unexpected happens, and that lands as well (although plot contrivances abound if one reallllly thinks about it). Altogether, it’s a fun and effective erotic thriller that does exactly what it needs to—gets in, grabs you, pulls your attention along, surprises, and goes home. The ending is wrapped in poetic justice that gets better as you think about it, and altogether it’s a fine cinematic ride. The Voyeurs is a lot like its story. It’s not campaigning for Best Picture or trying to be the Next Great American Drama. Like any great erotic thriller it’s searching to grab you by the ID, wrap it in mystery and danger, and pull you in until the credits roll. It’s memorable and it largely works, like a Rear Window marinated in sex, and in that regard it reminds one of the 90’s erotic thrillers of yore but with a little less cheese and a bit more modern sensibility. It’s engaging, it’s imperfect, it’s hot, it’s fun: check it out.

"Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker T.J. Watt (90) during an NFL football practice, Saturday, ... [+] July 24, 2021, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) Ben Roethlisberger made a public plea for his teammate to get paid and the Pittsburgh Steelers’ veteran quarterback got his wish a day later. The Steelers agreed to terms with star outside linebacker J.T. Watt on a four-year, $112-million contract extension Thursday, according to multiple sources. The deal includes $80 million in guaranteed money. The sides came an agreement a day after Roethlisberger said the Steelers should pay Watt “whatever he wants.” The Steelers were also willing to change their contract policy to get Watt in the fold through the 2025 season. The organization has always held fast in negotiations to not fully guaranteeing money in a contract beyond the first season. However, Watt’s salary is guaranteed for the 2021-23 season. Of the $80 million guaranteed, $35 million comes in a signing bonus. The other $45 million consists of salaries of $1 million this season, $24 million in 2022 and $20 million in 2023. Watt will also have salaries of $21.05 million in both 2024 and 2025, though they are not guaranteed. The contract contains the most guaranteed money in Steelers’ history. Roethlisberger’s extension in 2015 included $60.75 million guaranteed. Watt becomes the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL with his average salary of $28 million over the life of the contract. That surpasses the $27 million annual average value of Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa’s deal. Watt’s $80 million guaranteed through the first three years is also slightly more than Bosa’s $78 million over the same span. For comparison’s sake, Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack gets $73.7 million in his first three years and Cleveland Browns defense end Myles Garrett is guaranteed $62.546 million in that span. Throughout the preseason, Watt held what amounted to a “hold in.” He reported to training camp and took part in individual drills but did not participate in 11-on-11 team drills. He also sat out all three exhibition games. Watt has not addressed the media since camp opened and Steelers coach Mike Tomlin would never fully explain his star linebacker’s situation. However, it was clear Watt did not want to risk potential injury without having a deal done. Watt did practice with the team Wednesday, though, when the Steelers began preparing for the season opener against the Bills on Sunday in Buffalo. That appeared to be a sign of a deal being imminent. The Steelers also have a longstanding policy of not negotiating contracts during the season. After having just two days’ worth of full practice, it remains to be seen how many snaps Watt will get Sunday. “I think we’ve got to be careful about how many plays he plays,” Steelers defensive coordinator Keith Butler said Thursday. “He’s a veteran. He knows how he feels. He knows how he’s going to feel when he starts playing and stuff like that. We’ve just got to be smart enough to know how much is too much and how much is too little.” The Steelers selected Watt it the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft from Wisconsin with the 30th overall pick.

"Want Want China Chairman Tsai Eng-Meng childhood dog ""Happy"" recovered from adversity and is a ... [+] symbol of confidence at the company. A company promotion video by Want Want China highlights its leaders and staff energetically saying the company’s Chinese-language name (pronounced as Wang Wang!).  And why not? Want Want, led by Taiwan billionaire Tsai Eng-Meng, is one of most successful food and beverage companies to come out of Greater China in the past three decades; quirky Chinese snack foods like rice crackers and milk beverages are convenience store mainstays that endure despite competition from bigger global rivals such as Nestle, Unilever, Danone and Pepsico. Just outside of Tsai's office is an enormous painting of his childhood dog “Happy” (reincarnated by marketers as “Yappy”) who – the story goes — bounced back from an accident and also embodies resilience and confidence. Hot-Kid, the smiling cartoon boy in a tank top that serves as the company mascot, appears on all of Want Want products; a pure gold 34.4-kilogram Hot-Kid logo hangs at the front door of its Shanghai headquarters.  Yet the cheerful video that welcomes visitors pre-dates Covid-19. Since early 2020, mighty Want Want is also an example of how many businesses globally are grappling with the pandemic. From its base in China, the world’s No. 2 economy and a GDP growth leader, Tsai had hoped two years ago to be accelerating an international rollout in 2021. Want Want had just opened an office in Germany, launched a $50 million investment in Vietnam, and started opening its own offices in Southeast Asia rather than using distributors.   Instead, the Covid-19 spike in Vietnam has slowed the expansion there, part of a larger hit that the pandemic is having on global supply changes from textiles to electronics in that Southeast Asia country. Travel restrictions have hurt other overseas expansion plans. Back at home in Taiwan, the once- Covid-free island is also battling local and imported cases. Even China was hit with Covid-19 related lockdowns this summer. “The outlook for the pandemic isn’t certain,” a frustrated Tsai told Forbes. The entrepreneur is spending most of his time this year in Shanghai, helping Want Want  with a part of the business he has long enjoyed: launching new products. Want Want is still looking for international partnerships, and would consider acquisitions if it makes sense, Tsai said.   Want Want China Chairman Tsai Eng-Meng.

It was unconventional at the time— most crackers in Taiwan were made from wheat flour and took far less time to make; young Tsai found a partner, packaged them as gifts for Chinese New Year and other holidays, as well as offerings at Taiwan temples where visitors asked for favors from deceased ancestors and powerful spirits. “The spirits know what you want and what you leave behind,"" Tsai told me an interview back in 2009. Tsai moved into China in 1992, and, switching his focus to mainland children (and their parents), and expanded from snacks into drinks. His nearly $6 billion fortune on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List today covers includes shares in Want Want, but also assets in an empire made up of hotels, real estate, insurance, media and healthcare, among other businesses.  Want Want sales have held up, buoyed by China’s overall strong GDP performance.  Want Want revenue rose by 9.5% to 22 billion yuan, or $3.4 billion, in the 12 months to March; net profit rose by 14% to 4.1 billion yuan. Sales outside of Greater China accounted for only 3% its total. Want Want China entered the yoghurt market two years ago; the company's ""Hot-Kid"" mascot appears on ... [+] the ad. China’s good prospects fit in well with his own hopes to work with others globally. “China’s the largest market in the world for so many products, and if you’re successful here, you can be the largest in the world,” he said. The pandemic doesn’t seem likely to change that – or Tsai’s international ambitions — anytime soon.   @rflannerychina",https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/09/09/yappy-power-greater-china-snack-billionaire-eyes-global-growth-amid-pandemic/,Yappy Power: Greater China Snack Billionaire Eyes Global Growth Amid Pandemic
"Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, reacts after scoring a point against Aryna Sabalenka,of Belarus, during ... [+] the semifinals of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) For the first five games of her maiden Grand Slam semifinal, it looked like 19-year-old Leylah Annie Fernandez might simply be overpowered by world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka. The 23-year-old Sabalenka dominated from the baseline and took a quick 4-1 lead in the U.S. Open semifinal. It appeared she might put a sudden halt to Fernandez’s magical run that had captivated the New York crowd, including Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash, a fellow Canadian who sat in Fernandez’s box for the final. But the feisty left-hander — as she has done here for close to two weeks — showed poise and power that belies her age and roared back to win the match, 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours, 21 minutes, to advance to the all-teenage U.S. Open final on Saturday afternoon.  In the final, she will play fellow teenager Emma Raducanu of Britain, who destroyed Maria Sakkari of Greece in straight sets for her ninth straight victory without dropping a set. The winner will take home $2.5 million and the runner-up $1.25 million. Fernandez had earned about $374,000 in 2021 entering the U.S. Open. “I don’t care [who I play],” Fernandez said, “I just want to play a final right now.” Asked how she got to the final, an exhuberant Fernandez told ESPN’s Pam Shriver on court: “I have no idea. I would say it’s thanks to the New York crowd. They never gave up for me, they fought for me. So thanks New York, thanks to everyone.” It was Fernandez’s third victory over a top-5 player at this tournament, including wins over four-time major winner and defending champion Naomi Osaka in the third round and No. 5 Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. She also beat three-time Grand Slam champ Angelique Kerber in the fourth round. Fernandez is the youngest woman since a 17-year-old Serena Williams in 1999 to beat three top-5 players at a major. Serena toppled Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis en route to the crown in 1999. Hingis and another teenage sensation, Tracy Austin, both watched from the stands as Fernandez beat her latest victim.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Fernandez literally came out of nowhere during this run. Before this her biggest showing was winning the title at the Monterey Open in March, and reaching the final in Acapulco in 2020. In the decisive third set, the players traded breaks before Fernandez held for a 5-4 lead on a service winner, yet again pumping her fist toward her player box. Serving at 4-5, Sabalenka double-faulted twice (to bring her total to 10 for the match) to give Fernandez triple-match point. Sabalenka hit a forehand long and Fernandez fell to the ground bfeore coming to net and shaking hands. “I just really wanted to be in the finals, I really wanted it,” Fernandez said. “Aryna fought for the same thing. I don’t know how I got that last point but I’m glad I’m in the finals.” Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, returns a shot to Aryna Sabalenka,of Belarus, during the semifinals of ... [+] the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) After fighting back to force a first-set tiebreak, Fernandez got down a quick 2-0 in the breaker. But she won seven of the next eight points as Sabalenka gifted Fernandez two points with an overhead smash long as the crowd roared and a double fault to fall behind 3-6. On set point, Fernandez hit a serve winner, the crowd erupted and Eric Clapton’s “Layla” began to blare in the stadium. In the second set, Fernandez appeared to tire after taking a 3-2 lead. Sabalenka broke Fernandez for.a 5-4 lead when Fernandez hit a backhand long. Sabalenka then closed it out with a serve and volley to even the match at one-set all. Fernandez credits Nash, who loves to play tennis when he’s not coaching Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, with serving as “inspiration.” “It’s a huge inspiration,” she said. “I remember my dad used him as an example once for a whole month, telling me we have to fight hard just like Steve Nash. So it’s an honor to have you here cheering for me/ Hopefully we can have a tennis match, too.” Fernandez’s coach and father, Jorge Fernandez, traveled to New York from Florida for the semifinal but was not in the stadium, preferring to watch on TV. Her mother, Irene, has been a steady presence in her player box. Said Leylah after the quarterfinal: “My dad told me so many things but today he told me to go out there, have fun, fight for every point. Today’s your first quarterfinals, don’t make it your last. Fight for your dream.” Now the dream continues into the final — where she is one more win from the title.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/09/leylah-fernandezs-magical-ride-continues-as-the-19-year-old-moves-into-the-us-open-final/,Leylah Fernandez’s Magical Ride Continues As The 19-Year-Old Moves Into All-Teenage U.S. Open Final
"Shale drillers are benefiting from rising natural gas prices. (Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty ... [+] Images) After years of tough times, the natural gas industry is booming. The future looks bright – unless the Biden administration targets clean-burning gas in its climate agenda.   In Appalachia, the largest U.S. gas basin, natural gas prices are more than double last year’s average, which has turned producer focus on funding operations by generating free-cash flow into a gold mine.  As a result of those swelling coffers, nearly all of the large independents in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays are reducing debt and getting in a position to return capital to investors within 18 months.   This remarkable turnaround from the dire market conditions of just two years ago has been driven by investor demands for capital discipline that emerged from the severe 2018 and 2019 downturn. These same Appalachian pure plays – dominated by some of the largest U.S. gas producers – were hanging by a thread as capital markets all but slammed shut.   Sticking to capital and production discipline – even with the U.S. gas forward curve in a $3 to $4 per million Btu range through winter 2022-23 — and deploying free cash flow to the balance sheet has become harder as U.S. demand continues to rise along with tempting potential profits. However, the strategy has paid off handsomely.   At current strip pricing, Scotiabank 
  
  BNS 
  notes that all the major Appalachian independents are poised to meet investor expectations to bring debt-to-cash flow ratios to a 1-1.5x range by year-end 2022. Leveraged debt fell 0.15x in the second quarter, pulling the average debt burden of the group to 2.6x, just above the sub-2x targets that most management teams have said must be met before initiating substantial cash returns.  Favorable hedging positions for 2022 — already at a stout 60 percent-plus of output — and robust forward pricing builds confidence that free cash flow will remain abundant.    Scotiabank estimates that E&Ps reaped $210 million in free-cash flow in the first half of this year, up from $61 million in 2020. And based on reported hedging strategies, E&Ps could garner $525 million in free cash flow for full-year 2021 and $808 million in 2022.   EQT, the largest U.S. gas producer, is estimated to generate $716 million in free cash flow in 2021 and $1.4 billion in 2020. This dramatic change in financial health is righting the E&Ps’ once-floundering ships. With debt under control, some firms like EQT could soon attain investor-grade credit ratings.  Once gas-focused producers are back in good financial shape, investors may shift their attention toward growth. Encouraged by a rising gas strip and growing U.S. and international gas demand, some investors are more bullish on gas than oil amid the accelerating energy transition.  Still, ""disciplined"" growth will be the name of the game as investors will continue to demand cash returns. Some investors were surprised by how fast global gas markets tightened recently and see a brighter future for cleaner-burning gas than oil.   Eyeing growing LNG demand, producers added 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in production over the past year, bringing outbound Appalachian pipelines to 90% of capacity.   The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. gas production will average 92.9 Bcf/d during second-half 2021 – up from 91.4 Bcf/d in first-half 2021 – and then rise to 94.9 Bcf/d in 2022, driven by supportive gas and crude prices.  U.S. gas exports – of both liquefied natural gas and pipeline gas – are now at record highs. The EIA now projects U.S. LNG and pipeline gas exports to rise from a combined 14 Bcf/d in 2020 to 19 Bcf/d in 2022. Pipeline exports to Mexico increased from 5.4 Bcf/d in 2020 to nearly 7 Bcf a day in June 2021 due to an increased supply of associated gas from Permian Basin oil operations.   Gas market tightness in Asia and Europe has prompted higher U.S. LNG exports, the super-chilled gas used in power generation that burns 50 percent more cleanly than coal.   U.S. LNG has become the global market's shock absorber. Record low prices from April-July 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, led to up to 200 U.S. cargoes being canceled, and output fell to about 20% of capacity. But as global LNG demand bounced back, so did U.S. production, with plants now producing at capacity.  Supply tightness has pushed prices to record levels. Northeast Asian spot LNG prices are currently assessed at $16.10 per million Btu, versus $3.90/MMBtu this time last year. Prices on the Dutch TTF, Europe's de facto benchmark, were recently at their highest ever.   The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the good times to keep rolling for U.S. gas producers and exporters. The IEA projects incremental U.S. gas production to exceed incremental U.S. gas demand by ~5 Bcf/d over the 2021-2024 period. This incremental supply should result in higher LNG exports as liquefaction capacity rises in the market.   But the Biden administration’s climate agenda poses a real threat. Biden’s climate envoy John Kerry has said that natural gas is not “anything near a long-term solution” to help address climate change even while it can help replace coal in certain countries in the near term.  In his full comments, Kerry noted that “gas is still a fossil fuel, and gas is mostly methane, so it leaks and also produces CO2. It’s not, in our judgment, anything near a long-term solution, unless somebody discovers one-hundred-percent abatement.” That’s near-sighted, considering the widespread use of gas to displace coal in power generation has been the number one reason that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have consistently fallen over the past 15 years.   The administration has struggled to articulate its position on gas, possibly indicating that it is torn or undecided about gas’ role in the low-carbon energy transition.   Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has repeatedly said that shipping U.S. LNG abroad can play an important role in replacing dirtier coal, especially in Asia. She has also pressed the oil and gas industry to do a better job of reducing methane emissions associated with LNG in order to make that case credible. But she has not definitively said how long gas can continue playing a useful role in the clean energy transition.  But Team Biden would be wise to come around on gas given the abundance of reserves the U.S. is blessed with and the fuel’s ability to displace coal in the power sector. Gas with carbon capture and storage can also be critical to generating a “blue hydrogen” business that could help with hard-to-decarbonize industries like steel, cement and construction.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2021/09/09/natural-gas-producers-on-roll-biden-could-be-a-roadblock/,"Natural Gas Producers On Roll, Biden Could Be A Roadblock"

(Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Privé Alliance) Half a dozen songs debut inside the top 10 on the newly-published Gaon Download chart, the weekly ranking of the bestselling individual songs in South Korea. In addition to the six brand new wins, one other popular release returns to the loftiest tier on the roster, further refreshing the area. BTOB lands the bestselling song in South Korea this time around as their new single “Outsider” opens in first place. The tune, which fronts their new EP 4U: Outside, which itself starts in the runner-up space on the Gaon Albums chart, is another major win for the boy group, whose name stands for Born to Beat. Rapper, singer, dancer and all-around performer and entertainer Key launches his new single at No. 2 on the Gaon Download chart, thanks in part to the inclusion of fellow musician Taeyeon, who is also credited on “Hate That…” The cut will be featured on his forthcoming solo EP Bad Love, which is expected later in September.  The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber push their collaborative single “Stay” up three spaces to No. 3, further certifying the tune as a global smash. The song rises one rung on the all-encompassing Gaon Digital chart, making the two musicians the rare non-Asian acts to rule over the most important songs ranking in South Korea. Exo and SuperM member (and incredibly successful solo musician) Baekhyun is back inside the top 10 once again with the single “Is It Me?,” which is featured on the soundtrack that accompanies the TV program Lovers of the Red Sky. Baekhyun seems to return to the highest tier on this list specifically every few weeks, so it’s not odd to see his name here. “Is It Me?” enters at No. 4. Singer K.Will earns another sales hit with “Back In Time,” which kicks off its time on the Gaon Download chart at No. 5. The cut is featured on the soundtrack (a common occurrence) that was created for the online animated program Moon Rising at Noon.  South Korean indie folk duo MeloMance debuts their new single “Go Back” at No. 6 on this week’s Gaon Download chart, earning an important top 10 success. The track also starts inside the top 20 on the Gaon Digital ranking, which is a notable launching point for any band. Girl group Fromis 9 is enjoying a big week on the Gaon charts, as their new single album Talk & Talk debuts inside the top 10 on its respective ranking, while the tune itself begins its time in the country as the seventh-bestselling release this frame. After rising to relative fame last year on the competition TV show Mr. Trot, Kim Ho-jong scores another top 10 sales win in South Korea with the song “Full Bloom,” which leaps more than 30 spaces to enter the loftiest arena on the Gaon Download chart. This time around, the cut is up to No. 8. The last two titles present inside the top 10 fall slightly, but manage to earn another turn inside the uppermost region, with Red Velvet’s “Queendom” slipping to No. 9 while Stray Kids’ “Thunderous” dips to No. 10.

"Oscar Isaac in The Card Counter Paul Schrader is no stranger to troubled male protagonists with dark pasts or presents, and The Card Counter follows yet another such protagonist in an engaging film that can interestingly be called both muted and electric at the same time. The film stars Oscar Isaac as former interrogator-turned-professional gambler William Tell, a man torn away from the world in every possible way by his past sins. William was one of the military interrogators who went down for torturing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. He served a time for it, a sacrificial lamb of sorts thrown under the tread of the military machinery while civilian contractors and military brass walk away clean. In the slammer he taught himself the art and probabilities of counting cards, and ever since he lives on the road, a modern anonymous nomad running from regret. One fateful gambling foray sees him visit a talk by an old civilian contractor in Iraq, the man who trained him to torture, Major John Gordo. Despite Gordo’s pivotal role in the torture, he walked away free from the fallout. William is chased down by Cirk (Tye Sheridan), the son of another of Gordo’s trainees who similarly fared less well than Gordo—he killed himself. Cirk recognizes Tell and proposes a plan: revenge. Simultaneously Tell meets La Linda, a backer of gamblers who’d like Tell to up his takes and work with her—she provides the cash for bigger endeavors and he splits the winnings. These counter-pulls disrupt Tell’s ordinary life, propelling him towards a tense crescendo at the end. William Tell is a muted man, one who travels solo, gambles modestly, wraps his motel rooms in white sheets to eliminate all traces of his existence... not just from the casinos he frequents but from himself. He’s a man who deep down wants to be erased, and Isaac plays him with such a steadied intensity and visible regret that it’s easy to sympathize with him even as you know he’s done the unforgivable. It’s clearly his film, around which the rest rotates. Tye Sheridan also gives a solid performance as Cirk, an unmoored and somewhat spontaneous young man with a troubled familial past. Tell seems to gravitate towards Cirk as almost a father figure would—as it saving him means saving a part of himself. Alexander Dynan’s cinematography is another bright star here, ably using light and color to make the motel rooms featureless, the hopeful excursions magical, and the casinos and hotels feel oppressive, menacing, and all-consuming. Accompanied by an exceptionally emotive score and each moment feels like Tell’s life is a constant stream of being digested by these dark, dingy dens and spit out for eternity. As always, Schrader has a knack for dialogue that rings both true yet unusual, though in this case there are a few errant moments of exposition that could use a little honing. Structurally, the film is a breezy watch even if only to watch Isaac’s masterful performance. It’s engaging throughout, although some plot turns in the set up or towards the climax feel a little abrupt or convenient. The biggest issue with the film, unfortunately, is with Tiffany Haddish as La Linda. It’s impossible to walk away from any scene she’s in here without a strong sense that she’s acting or attempting to wear a performative shoe that doesn’t quite fit. Stacked against Isaac’s flawless performance and the miscast stands out every time. The Card Counter is an engaging film about a man haunted by his own sins, and one adeptly performed by an Oscar Isaac at the peak of his powers. Is it a perfect film? No. But it is a quite good one that succeeds royally as a showcase of Isaac’s considerable talents, alongside a masterful command of tone thanks to its stunning and moody cinematography and score. It’s definitely one you won’t want to forget, and Isaac’s performance certainly won’t be forgotten come Oscar season.

(AP Photo/Rene Macura) Sadly, Michael Constantine died on August 31 at his home in Reading, Pennsylvania. He was 94. His agent, Julia Buchwald, confirmed the death but did not give a cause. Born Gus Efstratiou on May 22, 1927 in Reading, Pennsylvania, Constantine began his career on the New York stage in the mid-1950s as the understudy to Paul Muni in drama Inherit the Wind. He made his film debut in The Last Mile in 1959 and had a small role in The Hustler in 1961 opposite Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. On television, Constantine built his acting resume with guest roles on memorable series like Dr. Kildare, Ben Casey, The Untouchables, The Outer Limits, Perry Mason and The Fugitive. His first regularly scheduled TV role was in comedy Hey, Landlord, which aired in the 1966-67 season. And he headlined his own sitcom, Sirota’s Court, on NBC in the 1976-77 season. But, like Hey, Landlord, it did not even last a full season.  Dozens of other TV guest appearances followed — Lou Grant, The Love Boat, Remington Steele, the original MacGyver, Murder, She Wrote and Law & Order, to name a few.  Constantine, of course, reached a career zenith in My Big Fat Greek Wedding as the old-fashioned patriarch who insists that his oldest daughter, Toula (Nia Vardalos), marry a nice Greek man. The film became the highest-grossing romantic-comedy of all time with a $241.4 million domestic gross.  ""Michael Constantine, the dad to our cast-family, a gift to the written word, and always a friend,"" tweeted Nia Vardalos, ""Acting with him came with a rush of love and fun. I will treasure this man who brought Gus to life. He gave us so much laughter and deserves a rest now. We love you Michael.""

" Officials in Mississippi, one of the states with the lowest coronavirus vaccination rates, are urging pregnant women to get inoculated against the virus as a new wave of infections driven by the delta variant has caused an uptick of deaths among unvaccinated pregnant women in the state, as well as of stillbirths.

During a Wednesday press conference, Mississippi officials said eight women in Mississippi have died of coronavirus in recent weeks, all of whom were unvaccinated. There have been 72 stillbirths among unvaccinated mothers, which is the death of a baby in the womb after 20 weeks of pregnancy, roughly double the normal rate, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said Wednesday, which he described as “a real tragedy.” Dobbs urged Mississippi residents, especially pregnant women, to get vaccinated against coronavirus in order to “protect the most vulnerable people within our population.” Only 40% of Mississippi residents are fully vaccinated against coronavirus, compared to 54% of the overall U.S. population. Less than 25% of pregnant people in the U.S. have been vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Coronavirus is especially dangerous in pregnant women and can be deadly for the baby in the womb, health experts say, with one study released in July finding that pregnant individuals infected with coronavirus have a higher likelihood of giving birth before full term, which is associated with lifelong health problems for babies. Last month, the CDC  recommended that pregnant people get vaccinated against coronavirus, saying there’s no evidence the vaccines are dangerous or increase the likelihood of miscarriage.

Steady at No. 1 for a second turn is Noeasy by Stray Kids. The boy group’s fifth chart-topping release spends another frame as the bestselling title in South Korea. A No. 1 holdover is a somewhat uncommon sight, as more often than not, there is a new winner every week. The highest-ranking debut of the period in South Korea comes from boy group BTOB, an acronym for Born to Beat. The band starts their new EP 4U: Outside at No. 2, missing out on the highest space by just a single space. The title is their sixteenth top 10 in the nation, a sum which includes half a dozen leaders. Lead single “Outsider” launches just inside the top 40 on the Gaon Digital chart, which ranks the most successful songs in the country, and it kicks off its time on the Gaon Download list as the bestselling tune in the territory. After peaking in the runner-up space almost a month ago, Red Velvet’s Queendom EP is back inside the top 10, and it almost returns to its best placement. The title jumps double-digit spaces to settle at No. 3, landing just ahead of a pair of fellow rising successes. The Boyz’s chart-topping Thrill-ing surges to No. 4 (after opening at No. 1 a month ago) while Jay B’s Somo: Fume makes its way back to No. 5, where it launched a few weeks back. New at No. 6 is MCND’s The Earth: Secret Mission Chapter.1, the five-member vocal act’s fourth top 10 project in their home country of South Korea. The short set, their fourth EP, appears to be the first in a series that will likely continue. Back inside the top 10 is BTS’s Butter single album, which features just two proper songs and instrumental versions of both. The set debuted at No. 1 earlier in the summer, as did the title track, which has become perhaps the biggest hit in the band’s arsenal. Right behind the boy group’s latest leader is former Iz*One member Eunbi Kwon, whose solo debut EP Open holds at No. 8 after launching in that slot last period.  Girl group Fromis 9 start their latest single album Talk & Talk, which features just that single, at No. 9, narrowly entering the top 10. The many-membered band has now broken into the highest tier with seven different projects, with more than half of those being short single albums. The song starts as the seventh-bestselling track in South Korea, while on the all-encompassing Gaon Digital chart, the tune barely launches inside the upper half of the 200-spot ranking. Closing out the top 10 is BTS, who once again land two appearances inside the highest tier on the tally. The septet’s Map of the Soul: Persona, released in the spring of 2019, is once again a bestseller, as it steps up to No. 10. Here are the 10 bestselling albums in South Korea this week.

[+] Activation during the Alabama Crimson Tide's Media Day for the College Football Playoff National Championship on January 5, 2019, at the SAP Center in San Jose, CA. (Photo by Chris Williams/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) It’s September and the college football season is underway. Today, we have some early trend lines from Opendorse on how well the athlete endorsement industry (NIL) is faring.  From July 1-August 31, the top three NIL activities are: posting content (47.8%), licensing rights (19.1%) and signing things (autographs) (12.8%). Looking at the gender comparison across NCAA Divisions:            NCAA Division I – Men lead the women 80.3% to 19,7%            NCAA Division II – Women lead the men 66.9% to 33.1%            NCAA Division III—Men lead the women 84.3% to 15.7% The average compensation for all athletes across all three Divisions is $458.74. Several things jumped out in this very early read of the landscape. It is surprising that providing instruction wasn’t higher on the list (0.4%), as athletes running their own camps and clinics was one of the advantages most cited by advocates. It could be because the July 1 start date did not allow for time to ramp up summer camps and clinics. Look for that to change in 2022. BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA - OCTOBER 24: Derek Stingley Jr. #24 of the LSU Tigers in action against the ... [+] South Carolina Gamecocks during a game at Tiger Stadium on October 24, 2020 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. (Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images) There has been a lot of talk around car deals, including the very fancy Ford Shelby GT LSU star cornerback Derek Stingley accepted earlier this summer. I asked Opendorse CEO, Blake Lawrence, about how these arrangements work. Via email, he told me: “Car deals make headlines, but they make up a tiny portion of the NIL activities occurring in the market today. So for every high-value car deal, there are potentially thousands of deals with compensation of $100 or less.” He elaborated, “there certainly are nuances to every car deal. Most fans don’t realize that it’s likely that the cars are “leased” to the athlete, with the amount of the lease counted towards the athlete’s compensation total. If an athlete has received a $10,000 car lease in-kind, in exchange for ‘NIL’ activities, the $10,000 will be included (in the total)”. In fact, these arrangements are similar to the “courtesy cars” the coaches and administrators have been receiving from dealerships for decades. Also surprising are two other early trends—signing autographs and/or appearances somewhere are way down the list. Advocates predicted these two areas might rise to the top; but with only 1.7% and 1.2% of total activities falling into those categories so far, clearly the interest isn’t there just yet. Lawrence told me, “seasonality plays a role in NIL earning potential.” It’s important to keep in mind that this is one data set; there are other companies in this space as well.  According to Opendorse, for the time period from July 1-August 31, 2021: 1.    Big Ten 2.    ACC 3.    SEC 4.    Big 12 5.    Pac-12 6.    Mountain West 7.    AAC 8.    Big East 9.    Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Conference 10. C-USA 11. SWAC 12. A-10 13. Sun Belt 14. MAC 15. Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference 16. Horizon League 17. American Rivers Conference 18. Southern Conference 19. Centennial Conference 20. WAC 21. South Atlantic Conference 22. MAAC 23. Ivy League 24. Independents 25. America East 1.    Football 60.1% 2.    Women’s Volleyball 9.8% 3.    Men’s Basketball 9.7% 4.    Women’s Basketball 2.3 % 5.    Men’s Swimming and Diving 2.1% 6.    Softball 1.9% 7.    Men’s Tennis 1.8% 8.    Men’s Lacrosse 1.4% 9.    Men’s Soccer 1.2% 10. Women’s Ice Hockey 1.2% 11. Women’s Soccer 1.1% 12. Women’s Field Hockey 1.0% 13. These sports listed are currently less than 1% of the market: ·     Women’s Gymnastics ·     Baseball ·     Women’s Track and Field ·     Men’s Wrestling ·     Men’s Gymnastics ·     Men’s Track and Field ·     Men’s Golf ·     Women’s Tennis ·     Women’s Golf ·     Women’s Swimming ·     Men’s Ice Hockey ·     Women’s Lacrosse ·     Women’s Rowing When asked where he sees both the deals and strategy going over the next six months, Lawrence said “For individual sports, seasonality and success will always drive interest. But the entire NIL market will only grow over the next six months.  “We're beginning to see long-term commitments from brands and advertisers exceeding seven-figures to engage groups of college athletes. These brands will naturally become more comfortable with the rules and machinations of the market and increase spends in the near term.” For athletes looking to cash in, early trends point towards maximizing your opportunities and exposure during the season. There’s only one drawback; you have to also make time for classes, practice, weights, study tables, team meetings, etc. It’s great to be a college athlete.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenweaver/2021/09/09/when-it-comes-to-nil-value-football-is-still-king-but-women-rule-in-division-ii/,"When It Comes To NIL Value, Football Is Still King, But Women Rule In Division II"
"The Transportation Security Administration could hit air, bus and train passengers who refuse to wear masks with fines of up to $3,000, the agency said Thursday, part of a wider effort by the Biden administration to quell a delta variant-driven uptick in Covid-19 cases. A TSA officer wears a protective face masks while working at Oakland International Airport in ... [+] Oakland, California on Wednesday March 4, 2020. The TSA will double its range of possible fines for mask non-compliance starting Friday: First-time offenders could face $500 to $1,000 in civil penalties, and repeat offenders could pay $1,000 to $3,000, up from the $250 to $1,500 range announced when the TSA first rolled out a transportation mask mandate in early February. Federal officials have reported a surge in unruly airline passengers this year, and mask-related disputes are a frequent culprit: The TSA told Reuters it’s received more than 4,000 reports of mask incidents, and the Federal Aviation Administration says airline crews have reported over 3,057 mask-related problems this year. The TSA’s mask mandate is set to expire in late January, but Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday the federal government will keep enforcing the rule “as long as necessary to protect public health and safety.” TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in a statement the increased fines are designed to “reinforce the importance of voluntary adherence.” The TSA’s stricter posture is part of a wave of new public health measures announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday. Most notably, the Department of Labor will compel private companies with 100 or more employees to require their staff to either get vaccinated against Covid-19 or take weekly tests. The administration also says it will require federal employees and contractors to get vaccinated, mandate inoculations at health care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds and boost shipments of monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19 patients. In recent months, domestic air passenger numbers have gradually — but not entirely — recovered from a long slump precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. As more people return to the skies, federal officials and airline staff have warned of a high number of travelers who have been aggressive and abusive. The FAA has opened 752 investigations into unruly passengers so far this year, up from just 183 in all of 2020, and the TSA counted dozens of assaults against its staff from January to June. Authorities have blamed many of these incidents on passengers refusing to wear masks, but some airlines have also pointed fingers at intoxicated travelers, and the FAA said some unruly inflight behavior was tied to the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. “If you break the rules, be prepared to pay,” Biden said in a speech Thursday. “And by the way, show some respect. The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong. It’s ugly.” Many maskless passengers haven’t been penalized by the TSA. Out of more than 4,000 mask-wearing incidents this year, the TSA has referred just 126 people for civil penalties, with the vast majority of violations resulting in warnings, according to Reuters.

"The Los Angeles Board of Education voted Thursday to require coronavirus vaccinations for eligible students in order to attend in-person classes, making it the first major school district in the U.S. to mandate the vaccine, and setting a precedent for other school districts in the nation to possibly do the same. A student receives a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in Los ... [+] Angeles, California, the United States, on Aug. 30, 2021. Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD began on Monday to deliver first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines for students age 12 and older and district employees. (Photo by Xinhua via Getty Images) The Los Angeles Board of Education voted unanimously in favor of requiring students over the age of 12 to get vaccinated against coronavirus, with several board members arguing that it will keep coronavirus cases down in the school district. Under the new policy, all students over the age of 12 will need to get their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by November 21 and receive their second by December 19 to access school facilities, while those who participate in in-person extracurricular activities will need to get their first dose by October 3 and their second by October 31. Students who are 11 years old and will become eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccination during the school year will need to get their first shot within 30 days of their 12th birthday and their second within eight weeks.  Eligible students must upload their proof of vaccination and get it approved by January 10. Students can receive a medical or religious exemption. The policy will also apply to charter schools students on co-located Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) school campuses. LAUSD Interim Superintendent Megan Reilly introduced the proposal earlier this week, citing a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that showed the hospitalization rate among unvaccinated teens was 10 times higher than for those who are fully vaccinated. 7,784. That’s how many student Covid-19 cases have been identified in Los Angeles-area schools since August 15, the Los Angeles Department of Health said Thursday. According to the Los Angeles Unified School District tracker, 3,255 students tested positive for Covid-19 between August 2 and August 15. Some parents who spoke at the board meeting argued they should have the power to decide whether to get their children vaccinated. They also noted that coronavirus vaccines have still only been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds under emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and they argued that inoculations shouldn’t be mandated until the vaccines have been given full approval. LAUSD is the second-largest school district in the U.S., spanning 1,200 schools with more than 600,000 students enrolled in grades K-12. It has one of the most stringent Covid-19 policies in place, requiring weekly testing for students, teachers and school employees in order for them to step foot on school campuses. Last month, LAUSD announced it would require all teachers and staff to get fully vaccinated against coronavirus by Oct. 15. The moves come following an August surge of Covid-19 cases in California and around the nation due to the highly infectious delta variant. In mid-August, California’s seven-day average of Covid-19 cases was 32 per 100,000 people, up from 15 cases per 100,000 in mid-July. Cases have gone down slightly in the state, according to its tracker, averaging 23.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, though Covid-19 data is incomplete for recent counts. Another school district in California, Culver City Unified, was the first in the state to require its students who are eligible to receive the coronavirus vaccine to get vaccinated, according to KTLA. The school district, which has more than 7,000 K-12 students, announced last month that  students will be required to show proof that they obtained the vaccine by November 19.

(Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images) On the latest edition of the World Digital Song Sales chart, BTS narrowly beat Wizkid when looking at which acts claim the most real estate on the 25-space tally. It’s a testament to how diverse the roster is in terms of sound and style that the most successful artists this time around are a South Korean pop band and an African producer and singer. They couldn’t sound less like one another, but fans in the U.S. love them both, and they are succeeding spectacularly on the ranking this frame. Here are four tracks whose moves are worth noting on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart. No. 1 - Wizkid - “Essence (ft. Justin Bieber & Tems)” For the seventh nonconsecutive week, Wizkid rules the World Digital Song Sales chart with what has turned out to be his biggest hit as a lead artist, “Essence.” The tune was already on its way up rankings all around the globe before Justin Bieber hopped on board a remix, but after he became involved, the tune became a true smash. Following the release of the deluxe edition of his Made In Lagos album, Wizkid debuts three new tracks on the World Digital Song Sales chart, in addition to running the show once again. “Mood” with Buju launches at No. 9 while “Steady” and “Anoti” kick off their time on the tally in back-to-back positions, at Nos. 14 and 15, respectively. The Nigerian musician has now sent 25 tunes to the tally, including 14 top 10s.  No. 5 - Key - “Hate That… (ft. Taeyeon)” Former Shinee member Key, who now works as a solo musician as well as in many other sectors of the entertainment industry, debuts his new single “Hate That…” at No. 5 on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart, scoring the second-highest debut of the frame. Fellow South Korean superstar Taeyeon, who got her start as a member of the band Girls’ Generation, joins him on the cut, earning another top 10 hit in the process. No. 23 - Blackpink - “How You Like That” 20% of all the spots on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart are occupied by tracks that return to the tally, reappearing for another go as one of the bestselling “world” tunes in the U.S., with that label being somewhat vague. Blackpink’s “How You Like That” enjoys one of those comebacks, as the former champion finds its way to No. 23 after not appearing on the list last time around. The cut, which fronted the band’s first full-length The Album, has now racked up 60 weeks on the chart. No. 24 - BTS - “Mic Drop (ft. Desiigner)” BTS claim one-fifth of all the spaces on the World Digital Song Sales chart this week, which is nothing unusual for the band, as they easily rank as one of the most successful musical acts on the planet. This frame, two of the septet’s wins are returning champions, with “Mic Drop” featuring rapper Desiinger and their Japanese-language single “Film Out” bouncing back onto the roster. The cuts reappear at Nos. 24 and 25, respectively.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/09/blackpink-taeyeon-wizkid-and-bts-hits-making-moves-on-the-world-songs-chart/,"Blackpink, Taeyeon, Wizkid And BTS: Hits Making Moves On The World Songs Chart"
" Republicans in Congress railed against President Joe Biden’s plans to issue sweeping new orders aimed at getting tens of millions of federal workers and contractors, private sector employees and health care staffers vaccinated, with many casting the move as authoritarian. UNITED STATES - AUGUST 31: Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, speaks during the House Republicans press ... [+] conference on the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in the Rayburn Room in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, August 31, 2021. (Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) called the orders “insanity” and said they could lead to “full on revolt,” adding, “Honestly what the hell is wrong with Democrats? Leave people the hell alone.” That was echoed by other conservatives in the House: Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) accused Biden of “abusing the power of the executive branch,” and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), the chair of the House GOP conference, called it an “authoritarian power grab.” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the chair of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, vowed to introduce legislation to “blocki this egregious assault on Americans’ freedom,” though any bill would be unlikely to pass in a Congress controlled by Democrats. Administration officials say the government has the power to enforce the actions, which include mandating shots for federal workers and contractors, withholding federal funds from health care facilities that don’t mandate the shots for staff and fining businesses with 100 or more employees that don’t implement test-or-vaccine mandates. Jennifer Shinall, a professor of employment law at Vanderbilt University, told Forbes legal challenges against the orders are “likely to fail” given the strong legal precedent for the mandate for federal workers and the power of the federal government to control where its funds go. Biden earned praise from Democratic lawmakers, with Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) tweeting, “I support 1000% President Biden's aggressive new measures,” and Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) applauding him for “keeping our communities safe.” Despite near-uniform opposition from Republican lawmakers, polls suggest vaccine mandates like the ones Biden plans to implement are fairly popular. In a Washington Post-ABC poll of 1,006 U.S. adults released Wednesday, 52% of respondents said they support businesses requiring vaccinations for employees working in-person. 80 million. That’s how many private sector workers will be impacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s rule requiring businesses with more than 100 employees to implement vaccine-or-test mandates, the administration said. Officials said those who don’t comply could face fines of up to $14,000 per violation. “This would basically just give some more teeth to the pre-existing OSHA guidance that already said employers should be keeping their workplaces safe from COVID outbreaks, so this would be basically the next step,” Shinall said, adding that while it is the “most questionable” of Biden’s new orders, there is still a “very good case” for its legality.

"A judge on Thursday halted portions of a Florida law Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has cast as an “anti-rioting” measure, arguing the law’s definition of a riot is “vague to the point of unconstitutionality” and could imperil peaceful protesters with strict criminal penalties. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at a news conference on July 13, 2020 in Miami. Federal Judge Mark Walker issued a preliminary injunction barring DeSantis and several county sheriffs who were listed as defendants from enforcing the law’s definition of a riot, siding with a group of activist organizations that sued the governor four months ago and called the law — which imposes tight penalties for people linked to violent protests — “vague and overbroad.” Walker took aim at a section of the law defining a riot participant as somebody who “willfully participates” in a “violent public disturbance” involving an assembly of at least three people who caused injury or property damage. The judge said this definition could violate the First Amendment by ensnaring people who were present during a protest that turned violent but didn’t actually participate in any violence themselves, noting it “unfortunately takes only a handful of bad actors to transform a peaceful protest into a ‘violent public disturbance.’” Walker said his ruling offers “narrow relief” and does not bar law enforcement agencies from enforcing the law altogether. In a statement to Forbes, DeSantis’ office said it “vehemently disagree[s]” with the decision and plans on appealing the ruling at the federal 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs applauded the decision in a joint statement: “[The law] effectively criminalizes our constitutional right to peacefully protest and puts anyone – particularly Black people demonstrating against police violence – at risk of unlawful arrest, injury, and even death,” they wrote. “If this Court does not enjoin the statute’s enforcement, the lawless actions of a few rogue individuals could effectively criminalize the protected speech of hundreds, if not thousands, of law-abiding Floridians. This violates the First Amendment,” Walker wrote. “We vehemently disagree with today’s decision, but this case was always going to be decided by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals,” DeSantis’ office said. “There is a difference between a peaceful protest and a riot, and Floridians do not want to see the mayhem and violence associated with riots in their communities.” The law — signed by DeSantis in late April — lays out strict penalties for defacing historic properties, participating in violent protests, blocking highways or engaging in “mob intimidation” to induce people into changing their viewpoint. DeSantis proposed a bill to penalize unruly protests last year, citing last summer’s nationwide protests against police misconduct — some of which included elements of violence. Opponents have castigated this push, arguing Florida’s new law will punish peaceful protesters and is unnecessary because police already had legal recourse against violent actors. The Florida law was part of a nationwide wave of Republican-backed bills taking aim at some protesters.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/09/federal-judge-blocks-controversial-florida-anti-rioting-law-signed-by-ron-desantis/,Federal Judge Blocks Controversial Florida ‘Anti-Rioting’ Law Signed By Ron DeSantis
"The 32-year-old striker, once a revelation for Premier League side Liverpool, played his last ... [+] professional game for Turkish club Trabzonspor two years ago. For someone yet to sign a La Liga contract, Daniel Sturridge has a curious relationship with Spain. The country has both made and, in one sense, broken the English striker. Now it could make him again, as he sweats to revitalize a blossoming soccer career. Sturridge was one of the most clinical forwards in Europe during his days at Liverpool and is back scoring goals. Except, few are there to see them this time, as he trains and plays behind closed doors with top-flight Mallorca. The 32-year-old served a four-month suspension from the sport in 2020 after breaching betting rules; he provided his brother Leon with the inside track on a possible transfer from Anfield, which could have led to a monetary reward. The destination in question was Sevilla, although he didn't sign for the Andalusians, moving to Trabzonspor in Turkey instead before receiving the ban, which was just six weeks initially. Sevilla, incidentally, was the opposition when he netted the Reds’ goal in the Europa League final in 2016. Sturridge was a highly valued squad member and brilliantly opened the scoring in Basel when Liverpool lost despite his brilliance. Recovering from a long hiatus, he wants to discover that same form again. Mallorca, whose president is the Phoenix Suns’ owner Andy Kohlberg, is making forward strides, even without Sturridge in the competitive squad. Since returning to the elite fold, it has put points on the board and is seemingly at home with the best. One distinct feature has been the club’s open training stance, allowing Sturridge and Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson to work during the off-season earlier this summer. Hosting players from elsewhere is not commonplace. It is clever, though, and can only boost an existing cohort. Conditioning and playing matches behind closed doors have allowed Sturridge to rekindle his goalscoring touch in a competitive environment, and he is more motivated than ever to return to his best. The transfer window is no longer open, but his status as a free agent means a list of suitors could gather as he gains match sharpness. Given the Islanders’ hospitality so far, a contract with Mallorca remains a possibility too. Technical director Pablo Ortells has not ruled it out, according to Marca last month. After winning promotion back to La Liga, Mallorca has started the campaign brightly under Luis ... [+] García. If not, other La Liga teams will take note. Being a free agent means he is likely affordable to most Spanish sides if wages aren’t a problem. Sturridge would be a good fit in Spain, especially at a team like Mallorca, where he could become the driving force. Judging by his social media posts, which reveal his progression, a switch back to the Premier League would be unsurprising too. He is fit, ambitious and ready to prove a point. Delivering for big teams is nothing unfamiliar. Sturridge has represented Manchester City and Chelsea, as well as Liverpool. The latter, where he excelled after joining for around €15 million ($16.5 million), was his most expensive transfer to date. His playing time at Trabzonspor ended prematurely, but the experience makes him no stranger to the foreign leagues. Anyone who takes a punt on him, in La Liga or elsewhere, would see the rewards, as long as he stays free of injury. From those in Spain, a few stand out. Osasuna, Elche, Getafe and Alavés could do with options in the final third. Had newcomer Rayo Vallecano not added Radamel Falcao—aged 35 yet still a marquee signing according to many observers—to its ranks, it would fall within that bracket too. Cádiz is a well-drilled, tight-knit team under manager Álvaro Cervera, so less likely to recruit spontaneously. One thing is for sure: Sturridge is a different prospect now. For him, winding down is not an option at this stage of his career. He is primed, ready to remind the world of his ability. Whatever happens, Mallorca has provided him with the environment to succeed once again. An offer—from anywhere—is all he needs to do so.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/henryflynn/2021/09/09/daniel-sturridge-has-never-played-in-spain-yet-it-may-resurrect-his-career/,"Daniel Sturridge Has Never Played In Spain, Yet It May Resurrect His Career"
"The annual 9/11 Tribute in Light memorial is pictured in New York City. (Photo by Gary ... [+] Hershorn/Getty Images) Two decades after 9/11, American business leaders once again find themselves reshaping their role in order to tackle a new set of operational and security risks. Bill Udell, CEO - Americas, Control Risks  There’s no doubt that the 9/11 attacks left a lasting footprint on the U.S. national consciousness and priorities, touching on everything from immigration to air travel to security and privacy. 9/11 also left an indelible impact on American business leaders, who in its wake, found their scope of responsibility dramatically expanded as they were suddenly faced with a new risk consciousness and new challenges related to geopolitics, security, and business continuity.  In many ways, modern global risk management was born out of 9/11, as companies sought out deeper levels of intelligence to protect their assets from external, internal, and third-party threats, as well as deeper connections to the geopolitical forces at play in their operating universe. Now, two decades later, the C-suite continues to navigate a rapidly-evolving and multifaceted risk landscape that presents a high volume of information and potential threats around which to strategize. This crowded landscape is the one in which U.S. businesses entered the COVID-19 pandemic last year – a crisis that not only threatened employees’ physical health and safety, but also posed serious risks to companies’ global operations. While the lessons learned from 9/11 offered a framework for addressing the challenges of COVID, the C-suite again found itself reshaping its role in order to tackle a new range of operational and security risks. Although the business risk ecosystem was already expanding pre-9/11, the terror attack, others that followed, and the subsequent wars in the Middle East brought a heightened awareness to the vast amount of information business leaders needed to track in order to operate in a volatile world. For the first time, terrorism developed into a business risk that could directly impact employees’ well-being within and outside of the workplace.  The idea that employees could be touched by terrorism any time and anywhere – including when traveling and when working in the office – was a new idea for employers, and it caused many companies to take on a new sense of responsibility to create a safe workplace for all employees. As a result, threat monitoring quickly became a key component of the day-to-day consciousness for C-suite executives. Travel security programs took on new forms and many companies refreshed their global threat assessments, developed a deeper reliance on local partners for business operations, and many bolstered insurance policies and security plans against terrorism. Similarly, although companies were already facing a new set of modern risks and risk mitigation methods, COVID-19 brought a heightened awareness to vulnerabilities as organizations became more interconnected than ever before. From an external perspective, business leaders were forced to look critically at their supply chains, with a new awareness around the impact of localized and global impacts. Within their own organizations, the C-Suite faced a new set of responsibility related to remote work and employee well-being. Without having a direct insight into the daily lives of employees, it became easier to excuse certain threat indicators as pandemic-related stress or miss typical red flags entirely in the virtual environment.  At the same time, the C-suite’s idea of duty of care expanded to mental well-being and looking after employees’ personal and professional interests. Mass remote work also created a new set of challenges: With company networks and information more spread out and vulnerable than ever, IT and threat monitoring teams were forced into overdrive. The elevated consciousness brought about by COVID elicited a call for the C-suite to rethink risk, similar to the way they needed to do so in the wake of 9/11. While the collective shift in risk consciousness was elevated after both 9/11 and the onset of COVID, one major point of differentiation for the C-suite to contend with is the drastic change in the global operating environment and the impact of geopolitics. In the period immediately following 9/11, geopolitics and transnational security was suddenly a central concern for U.S. companies, with all eyes hyper-focused on the U.S. and how the world’s superpower would respond to the attacks. Terrorism became a threat that employers not only needed to actively prepare for and respond to, but also proactively strategize around. Nonetheless, business leaders still viewed the world - and the issues under their purview – through a somewhat unilateral lens.  Prior to the onset of COVID, companies and specifically the C-Suite were being called on by their employees and stakeholders to align corporate values and action to social causes. COVID intensified this trend as the global pandemic was accompanied by racial and social justice protests around the world. Companies were challenged to navigate activist expectations across various environments, while their operational business risks were simultaneously becoming more universal due to intertwined supply chains governed by fragmented political regimes.  These factors combined gave global businesses a much wider range of considerations to take into account. Furthermore, the blurring of personal and professional lives amid remote work – and increased activism from key stakeholders and shareholders – combined to form an environment in which social issues in particular became vital considerations for C-suite leaders. Just as employers needed to adapt the lessons learned from 9/11 to meet the challenges of the COVID era, it’s critical that employers continue to remain flexible in this ever-changing business environment to ensure employees are protected and feel safe in the remote and physical workplace. Much like post-9/11 changes to the C-Suite’s purview of risk and its impact on business, the changes brought about by COVID will have a lasting impact on business operations, expanding risk from a singular function to an ecosystem that requires every department within an organization to have a seat at the table when preparing for and responding to vulnerabilities.  As businesses grow fatigued of change and seek a return to normalcy, the anniversary of 9/11 serves as a reminder that the road ahead will be the “new normal,” and the new risk consciousness is now our benchmark from which to grow.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/riskmap/2021/09/09/for-c-suite-leaders-911-continues-to-offer-a-framework-for-organizational-change/,"For C-Suite Leaders, 9/11 Continues To Offer A Framework For Organizational Change"

(Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images) Once a month, Gaon, the organization that compiles and publishes weekly charts of the biggest and bestselling songs and albums in South Korea, also announces which pieces of music have earned coveted certifications after hitting special listening and sales milestones. Included in the latest roundup of newly-certified albums, which reflects consumption in the country in the month of August, are many of the biggest and most successful acts to hail from the nation, including one that scores one of the most impressive certifications ever. The big story this month is that BTS’s Butter, a single album the septet released in July, has now sold at least two million copies. The title, which only features four tracks—“Butter,” “Permission to Dance” and instrumentals of both cuts—was an instant No. 1 on the Gaon Albums chart, and it is already one of the bestselling releases of all time in South Korea. In fact, it is just the seventh collection to earn a two million certification since 2018, when the company began doling out the honors. Two releases are now double platinum-certified titles in South Korea, with Enhypen’s Border: Day One and Blackpink’s Kill This Love earning the coveted award at the same time. Blackpink, perhaps the biggest girl group in the country’s music industry at the moment, scores their second double platinum certification, as only their debut full-length The Album has performed better, advancing to million status late last year. Both of Enhypen’s certified releases, Border: Day One and Border: Carnival, are even at the double platinum level. Four other projects are now platinum-certified in South Korea, with two recent releases hitting that mark extremely quickly. Monsta X’s Take.1 Are You There? and Seventeen’s Special Album 'Director's Cut' are now both platinum titles, as are Exo member D.O.’s Empathy and NCT Dream’s Hello Future - The 1st Album Repackage (Kit). The last two efforts were released this summer, so they collected the honor in impressively fast fashion. NCT Dream’s debut album Hot Sauce was named a two million-seller in July, while its deluxe edition Hello Future went three-times platinum in August. Now, a different collectible edition of that repackaged set, titled Hello Future - The 1st Album Repackage (Kit), is also platinum on its own, meaning this era is historically massive one for the band. In South Korea, albums are certified platinum after selling 250,000 copies, and million status kicks in at, appropriately, one million copies sold. There are also multiples of both of those levels, such as double and triple platinum, as well as two and three million.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/09/bts-blackpink-enhypen-monsta-x-and-exos-do-earn-impressive-certifications-in-korea/,"BTS, Blackpink, Enhypen, Monsta X And Exo’s D.O.

"'Halloween Kills' Universal and Peacock have announced that David Gordon-Green’s Halloween Kills, which debuted yesterday in Venice to mixed-negative reviews, will get a day-and-date theatrical/streaming debut. Like DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby: Family Business (which debuted in theaters on July 2 and was on Peacock “for free” for the first 60 days of its domestic theatrical run), Blumhouse and Miramax’s Halloween threequel (written by Scott Teems, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green) will be available in theaters and on Peacock come October 15.  The again stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, this time in a “40-years-later” continuation of John Carpenter and Debra Hill’s 1978 original. Halloween, which earned a ridiculous $159 million domestic (from a $77 million debut weekend) and $256 million worldwide take from a $10 million budget in October 2018, was a “none of the other sequels counted” installment. Likewise, Halloween H20 acted as a “20 years later” offering which ignored everything after Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) and again Laurie against the boogieman.  So, I guess this is the second or third Halloween III, depending on how you count H20 and The Return of Michael Myers which was the fourth Halloween film but the third Michael Myers-centric installment. Fortunately, this is only as confusing as you want it to be. With the obvious caveat that none of this would have happened in a non-Covid timeline, there is reason to expect a severe downturn for this middle chapter of the Blumhouse-produced trilogy. But it wasn’t so sharp (in non-Covid times) to cause concern.  Halloween earned $47 million domestic while Halloween II earned $25 million (-47%). Rob Zombie’s Halloween (the Labor Day champ until just days ago) earned $80 million worldwide in 2007 while his Halloween II earned $39 million (-51%) in 2009. H20 sold itself as the first chapter in a new era of Halloween (it’s no secret that the franchise was about to go direct-to-video after The Curse of Michael Myers) to the tune of $55 million in 1998. But the mostly Laurie-free Halloween Resurrection earned just $30 million domestic (-55%) in 2002.  Heck, if you count The Return of Michael Myers (which brought back the Shape along with Donald Pleasance’s Dr. Loomis and opened ten years after the first Halloween) as a “folks were curious the first time” reset too, then note that Halloween IV earned $17.7 million in 1988 while Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers earned a franchise-low (sans inflation) $11.5 million (-35%) in 1989. So if we run the math, then we’re looking at, at best, a 65% retention (which is normal-to-good for most franchise) and a $101 million domestic and $166 million worldwide.  That was likely a best-case-scenario sans Covid. We’re probably looking at, especially with a mediocre reviews (many of which seemingly emphasize how little Laurie vs. Michael screen time we get), something closer to $80 million domestic and $128 million worldwide, which again would be just fine for a $15-$25 million sequel to a breakout horror smash. When your $10 million movie tops $255 million worldwide, your sequel can make a lot less and still make a lot of money.  Does this move, which has been in the works for awhile, mean that Universal knows that they’re probably looking at grosses closer to Old ($87 million worldwide on an $18 million budget) or The Forever Purge ($76 million/$25 million)? Maybe, maybe not. Recent history suggests that the folks who want to see the film in theaters will still do so.  That’s especially true now that Venom: Let There Be Carnage has moved up to October 1. In a skewed irony, that Peacock isn’t a hugely “well-known” streaming platform (think Netflix or even Disney+) means that there’s likely to be less of a theatrical cost. Paw Patrol is still pulling in the over/under $35 million it otherwise would have even with the Paramount+ availability, and The Boss Baby: Family Business still crossed $100 million worldwide.  That’s not to say that theatrical windows don’t matter. M. Night Shyamalan’s leggy Old ($47 million from a $16.5 million debut) has benefited from an old-school exclusivity window. And while The Forever Purge got the quick-to-PVOD treatment, it still legged out to $44.4 million domestic or a franchise-best multiplier of 3.55 x its $12.5 million debut. F9 got a month of exclusivity and earned $173 million on a $70 million debut, the leggiest “not a spin-off” Fast Saga flick since 2 Fast 2 Furious in 2003. This is partially about beefing up Peacock (October 2020 was their biggest month for horror/fantasy movies) and selling the platform as a destination spot for your Halloween season scary movie needs (#justice4Shudder). If I may speculate, it’s partially an experiment in terms of the upcoming Exorcist movie which will debut theatrically in October 2023, as that $400 million (!!) trilogy is seen as a theatrical/Peacock group project of sorts. If folks want to see Halloween Kills, they’ll either see it in theaters or check it out on Peacock. Oh, and this has no bearing on any hybrid plans for Halloween Ends next October. So, do try to get vaccinated.

"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday defended Dr. Anthony Fauci against a new slate of attacks inflamed by a report published earlier this week about funding approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for coronavirus research in Wuhan. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 22: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki participates in a White House ... [+] press briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House January 22, 2021 in Washington, DC. Psaki discussed various topics including the economic crisis that was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) A Fox News reporter grilled Psaki Thursday about whether Fauci lied to Congress about the type of research funded by the NIAID at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a subject that has been frequently raised by Republicans in recent months suggesting it could offer insight into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The question followed a report Monday by The Intercept  revealing two previously unpublished grant proposals from the U.S.-based health organization EcoHealth Alliance that were funded by the NIAID to conduct bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.  Critics have seized on this reporting to accuse Fauci of lying when he previously told Congress the NIAID had not funded “gain-of-function” research at the Chinese lab, referencing a controversial method that involves researchers modifying a virus to predict its evolutionary trajectory. But Psaki dismissed these accusations at a Thursday press conference, denying that Fauci lied to Congress about the nature of the research and emphasizing that the viruses studied under the grant program were unrelated to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.  The agency has “never approved any research that would make a coronavirus more dangerous to humans,” Psaki said.  The NIH reiterated this point in a statement to Forbes and said that the research green-lighted by the NIAID in China was determined not to be “gain-of-function.”  “The research we supported in China, where coronaviruses are prevalent, sought to understand the behavior of coronaviruses circulating in bats that have the potential to cause widespread disease,” the NIH said in an email. “The body of science produced by this research demonstrates that the bat coronavirus sequences published from that work NIH supported were not SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, because of similar research to understand coronaviruses, we were able to move swiftly to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and save lives.” The first of the two grant proposals published by The Intercept sought funding for the screening of thousands of bat samples, as well as people who worked with live animals, for novel coronaviruses, and the proposal acknowledged that the research can be dangerous. The grant was awarded for a five-year period starting in 2014 and then was renewed again in 2019, but was suspended in April 2020 by the Trump administration. The second, focused on deploying resources in Asia in case of an outbreak of an “emergent infectious disease,” was written in 2019 but approved in August 2020.  There is still no concrete evidence that lab experiments could be the source of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, this subject has been the catalyst of months of tense partisan debate, with Republicans accusing Democrats of ignoring the so-called “lab-leak theory” and scientists increasingly encouraging an in-depth review of the matter. Fauci has previously clashed with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) over the research funded by Fauci’s agency, insisting that gain-of-function methods were never used in Wuhan and emphasizing the viruses studied under the grant program were unrelated to SARS Covid-2.  Paul, one of Fauci’s most prominent critics, was quick to seize on the newly published documents after they were published this week. “I was right about his agency funding novel coronavirus research at Wuhan,” the Kentucky Republican wrote on Twitter. “Fauci lied again.” Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/09/psaki-dismisses-gop-accusation-fauci-lied-to-congress-about-coronavirus-research-in-wuhan/,Psaki Dismisses GOP Accusation Fauci Lied To Congress About Coronavirus Research In Wuhan
" New York real estate tycoon Harry Macklowe and his ex-wife, Linda, are selling off 65 pieces from their legendary art collection following their bitter divorce that the auction house Sotheby’s estimates could fetch over $600 million, which would make it the most expensive art collection ever sold.

Sotheby’s said Thursday morning that it will sell the Macklowe collection in two separate auctions in November and May. Two of the jewels of the collection are “La Nez,” a grotesque hanging statue of a human-like figure with no limbs and a long, pointed nose by sculptor Alberto Giacometti, and Mark Rothko’s “No. 7,” from 1951, when the abstract artist perfected his signature square and rectangle paintings — a Sotheby’s representative said the two works could sell for up to $70 million combined.  Also up for grabs is one of Andy Warhol’s pop prints, “Nine Marilyns,” which features repeating images of actress Marilyn Monroe on a metallic background, estimated to sell for $60 million. A rare sculpture by Pablo Picasso called “Figure (Projet pour un monument à Guillaume Apollinaire)” that the artist created as an homage to the death of his close friend Guillaume Apollinaire, a French poet, and kept in his personal collection until his death could fetch $20 million. Cy Twombly’s “Untitled” painting from 2007, a monumental canvas with splatterings of red floral shapes, was inspired by Japanese poetry and could sell for another $60 million, the auction house said, adding it will likely appeal to Asia’s booming art market. The initial 34-piece collection to hit the block will preview in Sotheby’s spaces, in New York, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles and Paris before returning to New York, where the sale will take place.

"Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will open the 2021 NFL season against the Dallas Cowboys on ... [+] Thursday night. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will host the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL Kickoff Game this evening, starting off Week 1 of the 2021 season and bringing about the long-awaited return of professional football betting.  The game will take place at Raymond James Stadium, the site of Tampa’s Super Bowl LV victory back in February. Bookmakers are projecting the Bucs to pick up right where they left off, installing the side as nine-point chalk against Dallas.  The Cowboys are massive, nine-point underdogs for the contest, their first following a disappointing 6-10 finish last year. Fans in Dallas are optimistic, however, as the club finally has a healthy Dak Prescott back in the fold and made several major adjustments to the lineup leading up to the new campaign.  One new face to keep an eye on is Micah Parsons—the Cowboys’ first-round pick and Defensive Rookie of the Year favorite—a player capable of lifting this defense after an abysmal showing in 2020. Tampa Bay elected to keep the band together on the heels of hoisting the franchise’s second Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Bucs pulled off an impressive feat by retaining every key free agent this offseason. Their roster cohesion should them have a successful 2021 season, but it won’t be easy for the defending champs. They’ll be taking every opponent’s best shot during this expanded 17-game NFL season. Will Tampa Bay begin mounting a title defense by securing a double-digit victory in front of a nationally televised audience, or will the Cowboys shock the world by pulling the first upset of the season?  Those looking for an answer to these questions can find a prediction for this exciting Thursday night football game at the end of the article. Before getting into the NFL Kickoff Game picks, however, take a peek at the full schedule, start times, viewing information, NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel and more for every Week 1 matchup to start the 2021 season.  Thursday, Sept. 9 (8:20 p.m. ET)   Sunday, Sept. 12 (1:00 p.m. ET)   Sunday, Sept. 12 (4:25 p.m. ET)   Sunday, Sept. 12 (8:20 p.m. ET)   Monday, Sept. 13 (8:15 p.m. ET)   *The Packers at Saints game has been moved to a neutral site in Jacksonville, Florida after Hurricane Ida impacted New Orleans.  The NFL Kickoff Game on Thursday night and Sunday Night Football will both be live streamed via NBC Sports. Monday Night Football will stream on WatchESPN.   The spread on this game has steadily shifted in Tampa’s favor after opening with the Bucs laying 6.5 points. The odds now favor the home team by nine points, but that sizable line hasn’t deterred bettors from hammering the Bucs.  Tampa Bay is still drawing over half of the bets and cash wagered against the spread. As of Thursday afternoon, 56 percent of the tickets and 56 percent of the handle are on the Bucs to cover.   The 2021 NFL Kickoff Game went up on the board with an over-under of 52 points. That line hasn’t changed much in the time since, with most shops adjusting it down just a half-point at most.  The public is clearly rooting for a barn burner to open the new season, evidenced by 57 percent of all wagers coming in on the over. The sharper bettors are projecting scores to be at a premium in this contest, however, thoughts that are reflected in the handle. With only a few hours left until the game’s start time, 60 percent of the cash bet on the total is on the under.   Due to their status as a heavy favorite, bettors will need to risk $4.30 to win $1 on the Buccaneers starting the 2021 NFL season with a “W”. Those who believe the underdog Cowboys will pull an upset can make a moneyline bet, one that would return $3.30 for each $1 risked.  At these current odds, Vegas is implying an 81.1 percent probability that Tampa Bay ends up as the victorious team this evening. Dallas has just a 23.3 percent chance of upsetting based on its odds. Those wondering why the percentages add up to more than 100 percent should know it is due to the vig, which is the cut a bookmaker takes for facilitating bets.      Both the Cowboys and Bucs are healthy coming into the 2021 NFL season. Only one player from each squad’s active rosters will be sidelined in Week 1. Dak Prescott—who hasn’t suited up for Dallas since October—is listed as probable, but the Cowboys signal-caller will start in the opener.  Here are the players that do have injury designations for the NFL Kickoff Game: Dallas   Tampa Bay    After being sidelined nearly a full year due to injury, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott will ... [+] return to action to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 1 of the 2021 NFL season. The Cowboys will have a tough time stopping an electrifying Bucs offense that was instrumental to the team’s most recent Super Bowl victory.  Tampa Bay finished the 2021 campaign having averaged 30.8 points—the third-best mark in the league—and racked up over 384 yards of offense per game. The team kept that exact same scoring average throughout the playoffs and still managed to put up 378.5 yards per game against four quality postseason defenses.  With Tom Brady back for another run and once again joined by a top-tier supporting cast—one that includes Chris Godwin, Mike Evans, Rob Gronkowski and other elite weapons—the Bucs should have few issues putting up more big numbers again in 2021.  Dallas’ 2020 campaign went off the rails for several reasons, but its defensive performance ranks high on the list of failures. This unit gave up 386.4 yards per game to the opposition and its 158.8 rushing yards allowed ranked as the league’s second worst. Few teams allowed foes to score more, as the Cowboys gave up a pitiful 29.6 points per game, making it fifth-worst scoring defense in football last year. Credit Dallas’ brass for recognizing these issues and working relentlessly to fix them during the offseason. The team utilized each of its first six draft selections on defensive prospects—a run that started with standout linebacker Parsons at No. 12 overall—and expended eight of 11 total picks on that side of the ball.  The Cowboys also signed some veterans to pitch in on this defensive overhaul, coming to terms with guys like Keanu Neal and Tarell Basham to plug some glaring holes on the roster.  The Cowboys will begin to find out if these moves were the right ones tonight against Tampa, arguably the toughest test Dallas will face all season.  Even with a new-look defense and Prescott back in the mix, the Cowboys have little chance of spoiling Tampa’s banner-raising ceremony. The team is too thin and too young at too many critical positions, especially within its defensive ranks.  Don’t sleep on Dallas keeping this one close, however. The offense has a ton of potential and the talent to match the Bucs blow-for-blow for most of the season-opener.  Dallas has one of the NFL’s most enviable receiving corps, featuring second-year sensation CeeDee Lamb—expected to take on a larger role this year—and top-tier veterans in Michael Gallup and Amari Cooper.  Before going down last year, Prescott had this unit firing on all cylinders. The potential is there for this group to immediately get back to playing at the high level it was prior to the QB’s injury.  For that reason, it’s not an impossible ask for the Cowboys to finish within 10 points of Tampa, which is all they need to cover the spread and cash tickets for backers. As long as Prescott is close to 100%, he has the skill and the weapons surrounding him to keep Dallas in the thick of things.  Star running back Ezekiel Elliott should play a big role for the Cowboys tonight. The 26-year-old looks primed for a bounce-back season, getting a huge boost from Prescott’s passing ability and the respect it commands from opposing defenses. Expect to hear Elliott’s number called plenty of times tonight, especially if the Cowboys manage to go up early. Barring a herculean performance by Prescott, Elliott and the Dallas wideouts, Brady and the Bucs will ultimately pull away late. The future Hall of Famer will find enough holes in this soft defense and will surgically dissect the weak points once exposed.  Tampa bettors won’t be able to rest easy this evening though. Even if the Bucs take a commanding and have the game well in hand by the fourth quarter, the spread is simply too large to feel comfortable covering until the final whistle blows.  With a nine-point betting line, the threat of a backdoor cover will loom large during the closing drives of this 2021 NFL season opener. Even if the late score is ultimately meaningless, it will push the Cowboys within nine points and result in an ATS win for the underdogs.

"The First-Ever 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 When the current-generation of the Chevrolet Silverado debuted in 2019 it was generally highly regarded with one distinct exception, the interior. Compared to the cabin environment of the Ram 1500, even the upgraded package of the 2019 Silverado still felt a cut below. In early 2022, Chevrolet will be launching a refreshed Silverado that features a massively upgraded passenger environment on most models, hands-free Super Cruise driving assist and a ZR2 off-road version. Aside from the new ZR2 model, the sheetmetal of the Silverado is essentially carried over heading into 2022. The only notable changes on the outside are the grilles which now take more inspiration from the larger HD models, particularly the top end High Country.  2022 Chevrolet Silverado High Country The off-road specialist ZR2 is built to take on trucks like the Ford F-150 Raptor and Ram 1500 TRX with the ability to traverse deserts at high speeds or crawl over nearly any boulder. In addition to a distinct grille with a hollow bowtie badge that allows for slightly more cooling airflow, the ZR2 also gets a unique bumper. The lower portion of the bumper slopes back right into the forward skid plate and the outer corners have been cut away to enable higher approach angles.  The combination of the new bumper and standard 33-inch off-road tires gives the ZR2 an approach angle of 31.8 degrees, ever so slightly more than the 31.0 degrees available from the new Raptor with its standard 35-inch tires and slightly better than the 30.2 degrees available from the TRX. The breakover and departure angles are also similarly close, with the lead going back and forth but usually within 1 degree. When equipped with the optional 37-inch rolling stock, the Raptor takes the lead across the board with a 33.1 degree approach, 24.4 degree breakover and 24.9 degree departure. The end caps of the bumper are also removable for easy replacement in the event that it makes contact with boulders before the tires do.  2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 approach, breakover and departure angles Besides the revised face, the big differences for the ZR2 are in the suspension. Like the midsize Colorado ZR2, the Silvervado is equipped with Multimatic DSSV spool valve dampers. These dampers contain three spool valves to manage oil flow and three interconnected chambers to minimize aeration of the oil and keep it cool. Unique springs also give the ZR2 more suspension travel and contribute to the 11.2-inch ground clearance.  The ZR2 gets other off-road specific updates including electronic locking differentials on both axles, a two-speed transfer case and a terrain mode for one-pedal driving. Like Ford’s trail control, terrain mode allows the driver to set a speed in four-wheel-drive low and then just lift off the accelerator to slow when rock crawling.  (l to r) The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado High Country, ZR2 and LT Under the hood Unlike the Raptor and TRX, the ZR2 has a rather more pedestrian powertrain. It’s available exclusively with the 6.2-liter V8 with 420-hp and 460 lb-ft of torque paired up with a 10-speed automatic transmission. While the Raptor has a slight edge in power from its twin-turbocharged V6, the ZR2 takes the win in payload and towing with 1,440-lbs and 8,900-lbs respectively.  Apart from the ZR2, other powertrain changes are mostly limited to the base 2.7-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The 2.7 has a 30% stiffer crankshaft and adds upgrades typically used on turbodiesel engines including cast-in place ring carrier to support steel compression rings on the pistons and tri-metal connecting rod bearings. Unlike the usual pattern of reducing weight, the engineers actually added over two pounds of aluminum to the block through thicker ribbing that allows the engine to run at higher pressures. While peak power remains unchanged at 310-hp, the maximum torque in the low to mid-rpm range has been increased from 348 lb-ft to 420 lb-ft. The smooth and efficient 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder diesel engine remains unchanged for 2022, but it is now available with a new maximum tow package that increases the towing capacity by 4,000-lbs to 13,300-lbs. The upgraded towing comes by way of a stronger frame, new springs and a larger differential with a 3.73:1 final drive ratio in place of the normal 3.23:1 ratio. Chevrolet also made some upgrades to the powertrain cooling to handle the extra load.  It’s what’s inside The First-Ever 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 The changes that will probably impact more Silverado buyers than a new off-road package come in the cabin. The base work truck and custom trim levels retain the same interior as the current models. However, the other trims from the LT up to the High Country get an all-new look and improved materials. Directly in front of the driver is a 12.3-inch digital reconfigurable instrument cluster. In the center is a new 13.4-inch touchscreen with GM’s new Android Automotive based infotainment system.  2022 Chevrolet Silverado High Country Like Volvo/Polestar, GM has chosen to include Google

  Automotive Services with its implementation. That means navigation is provided by Google maps, Google Assistant provides voice recognition, and the Google Play app store allows apps to be downloaded and installed directly without having to connect a phone. By logging into a Google account, you’ll have access to contacts, calendar and other data stored in the cloud as well as any automotive approved apps that may have been purchased or subscribed to like Pocket Casts or Spotify. Apple iPhone users can also continue to use the apps on their phones through Carplay. This new infotainment system will be coming to most new GM vehicles as they get refreshed or redesigned starting with the new GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq.  Hands-off Like the 2022 GMC Sierra that we recently took a preview drive in, the updated Silverado will be available with GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driver assist system. The trucks get the second-generation version of the system that debuted earlier this year on the Cadillac Escalade and will have all of the latest updates. That includes on-demand or automatic lane changes, and the ability to go hands-free while towing. As with the Sierra, automatic lane changes and towing are mutually exclusive functions. If you want to change lanes while a trailer is hooked up, you’ll have to take over manual control temporarily.  2022 Chevrolet Silverado High Country Super Cruise operation is limited to use on 200,000 miles of divided highways defined by automatically updating high-definition maps. As a level 2 assist system, the driver also has to keep eyes on the road and be ready to take control at any time. That’s still enforced by the infrared camera mounted on the steering column.  For now, Super Cruise will only be available on the top end High Country trim.  The 2022 Silverado is scheduled to start production in the first quarter of 2022, although at this point, with chip shortages there are no guarantees. However, given the importance of trucks like the Silverado and Sierra to GM’s bottom line, they will no doubt get priority when it comes to allocating any available supply of silicon.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/2022-chevrolet-silverado-gets-new-interior-zr2-off-road-and-super-cruise/,"2022 Chevrolet Silverado Gets New Interior, ZR2 Off-Road And Super Cruise"
"Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania kicked off their controversial investigation into the 2020 election Thursday with a heated Senate committee hearing,  at which the ranking Democrat criticized the audit as a “sham” meant to erode trust in democracy, whilethe GOP lawmaker overseeing the probe insisted it’s merely an information-gathering operation. Protesters gather on the steps of the State Capital on November 05, 2020 in Harrisburg, ... [+] Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania state Sen. Cris Dush, a Republican who  is heading the investigation, led the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee hearing Thursday, along with the committee’s Democratic minority chair, Sen. Anthony Williams. Dush claimed the committee has jurisdiction to oversee elections and  said the probe would “gather and study” information about the 2020 election in order to clarify existing “ambiguit[ies]” in the state’s election laws. Williams slammed the probe as a “tragic charade,” saying it was not about “gathering information,” but rather “one part of an ongoing national attack on our electoral system.” Williams also said the investigation went against the Senate’s rules because the committee does not have any oversight or subpoena power when it comes to election-related matters, as Dush claimed, and the committee was acting “recklessly” and “with only political motive in mind.”  The committee’s pursuit of the audit could result in it becoming a “super committee” that has “no checks, and no balances, and no limits,” Williams warned. The hearing also featured testimony from Fulton County board of commissioners chair Stewart Ulsh, who criticized the burden the state’s policies put on the county and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State decertifying the county’s voting machines after it turned them over to a third party as part of a separate election audit—but said that audit did not actually reveal any fraud. Dush said the investigation was not about former Donald Trump or overturning the 2020 election results, saying “the horse was out of the barn as far as this investigation is concerned.” He claimed it was devoted to “looking intensely into the general election held in November 2020 and the primary election in May 2021 to evaluate [how] our election code is working.” “What is happening here is a travesty, plain and simple,” Williams said during his opening remarks Thursday. “This sham review is not the pursuit of transparency. The goal is, simply, to stoke distrust and division…and the most exasperating part of it all is that everyone on this panel knows this. We know this, and you know this, and yet here we sit.” Pennsylvania Republicans have said they plan to conduct a “full forensic investigation” and are expected to issue subpoenas and have a third-party vendor examine election materials, echoing the controversial election audit in Maricopa County, Arizona. Any subpoenas could face legal challenges, however, as Williams noted Thursday he does not believe the committee has the power to issue election-related subpoenas. Pennsylvania Senate Pro Tempore Jake Corman and his office have said the state is also likely to seek testimony from Pennsylvania citizens that claim to have experienced election fraud and compel testimony from county and state election officials, Reuters reports. Corman has reportedly rejected calls to employ the highly controversial firm Cyber Ninjas running the Arizona audit and will choose a different third-party company to oversee the probe, Reuters reports, and unlike the Arizona audit,  it is expected to be funded by the state Senate rather than private donations. The Pennsylvania state government and county governments have already undertaken audits that have affirmed the state’s election results, and there is no evidence of any widespread fraud. A slew of post-election lawsuits seeking to overturn the results in the state \overwhelmingly failed. The Pennsylvania audit effort was initially started in July by state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who asked three Pennsylvania counties to voluntarily turn over their election materials and threatened subpoenas if they did not. The counties refused to turn over their equipment and the Pennsylvania secretary of state said the state would decertify the voting machines of any county that did, and officials in conservative-leaning Tioga County called on Mastriano to “withdraw his demands and to let responsible Republicans get back to work.” As a result of the controversy, Corman kicked Mastriano off the audit effort and replaced him with Dush, saying Mastriano “was only ever interested in politics and showmanship and not actually getting things done.” The Pennsylvania audit is part of a broader nationwide effort by the GOP to launch moreArizona-style audits. The Biden administration has warned such investigations could violate federal law. Another partisan audit is getting under way in Wisconsin, where a Republican state lawmaker has subpoenaed several counties for their voting materials.he counties have rejected the subpoenas on the grounds that they were not signed by other leaders in the state Assembly as required by law.

(Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) The emergency order from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will impact 80 million workers and require unvaccinated workers to be tested at least once a week. Businesses that don’t comply with the order could face “substantial fines” up to nearly $14,000 per violation, an official told Forbes. The official also dismissed concerns that the rule will result in litigation, telling reporters Labor Secretary Marty Walsh has “a right to do this,” and said the rulemaking will be “done in a couple weeks” and implemented shortly thereafter. OSHA will also develop a rule to require businesses with over 100 workers to provide paid time off to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects, according to a White House fact sheet reviewed by Forbes. The administration will also stop giving federal workers the option to submit to regular coronavirus testing instead of getting vaccinated, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki telling reporters unvaccinated workers will have about 75 days to get their shot. Psaki said federal workers who refuse to get vaccinated after 75 days will go through the “standard HR process, which includes counseling,” and will face “progressive disciplinary action.” Biden will sign an additional executive order extending that vaccine mandate to contractors that do business with the federal government. Biden is also expanding a directive withholding federal funds from nursing homes that don’t mandate coronavirus vaccinations for staff to “most healthcare settings” that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, covering 17 million health care workers. Biden’s sweeping new coronavirus and economic recovery plan also includes increasing the number of federal personnel deployed to hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, accelerating the distribution of monoclonal antibodies and coronavirus tests, doubling fines for violating the government’s mass transit mask mandate, expanding loans and loan forgiveness to small businesses and pushing for vaccine mandates and regular testing in schools. 652,480.

"Sandra Oh and Jay Duplass in 'The Chair' now streaming on Netflix.  There is so much packed into each episode of the new Netflix dramedy series The Chair but for first-time TV writer Amanda Peet, the original concept revolved around “a mad, long-standing crush.”  She and Annie Julia Wyman got busy writing the pilot for what would be one of the best new series of 2021 and they had a lot of ground to cover. “We really wanted to take a stab at writing a romantic comedy,” Peet explained in a phone interview.  And she immediately honed in on Sandra Oh as the lead character, Dr. Ji-Yoon Kim, a woman navigating her new role as the Chair of the English department at the prestigious Pembroke University in New England.  “Once we had the idea that Sandra was going to be newly promoted I thought about what would happen to this woman who is in love with this man and she’s in this position where finally the stars have aligned and there is an opening for this job and then he has a transgression at work and she’s forced to decide what his fate will be. I couldn’t stop thinking about putting Sandra in this god-awful position.”  Amanda Peet. Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images.  Though this is Peet’s debut as a TV series writer and showrunner, it isn’t her first time writing. She previously penned two plays: “The Commons of Pensacola” in 2013 and “Our Very Own Carlin McCullough” in 2018.  She’s happy people are bingeing the series and that fans are enthralled with the relationship between Oh’s character and her colleague, Professor Bill Dobson (Jay Duplass). “I like that people are wondering will they or won’t they have sex?”  By the end of the six-episode series it’s clear the two are in love but there’s still so much left to explore with this relationship. In addition to a love story, this show definitely covers some heavy subject matter and since its August 20 premiere it has been a conversation starter with topics that include sexism, racism and ageism. “I didn’t want it to feel like homework,” Peet says. “I wanted it to be an entertaining show.” At its heart, there’s that romance between Oh and Duplass. “There’s this beautiful sexual chemistry there but I felt like there wasn’t quite enough room to take it all the way. A lot of my favorite romantic comedies definitely have this drawn out simmering period.” She did her research and watched many of the classics in an effort to try to understand how that type of chemistry is created. “There’s this dance where they keep almost doing it and are then pulled away that feels suspenseful.” Peet has made us laugh over the years with comedic roles in classics like Something’s Gotta Give and Togetherness but she’s also proven that she can dive into the darkest parts of humanity with her recent role as desperate double-murderer Betty Broderick in the second season of the anthology series Dirty John. Like her genre-bending acting choices, Peet’s writing cannot be boxed into one specific category. With The Chair she tells a love story while simultaneously not shying away from many of life’s most serious issues. The show’s genius is that it tackles all of this with a sharp-edged, smartly-written and superbly acted humor. It’s a fast-paced ride that packs so much into its roughly 30-minute episodes.  Sandra Oh in 'The Chair' on Netflix.  She and Wyman certainly do not make things easy for Oh’s character, who is not only the first woman of color to take this position but is also one of the few people of color working at the college. In addition, her love life is beyond complicated and her English department is failing. In Ji-Yoon’s world no situation or decision is simple.  “For some women in leadership roles, including me, there’s this need to be liked that’s intense. I’m very emotional in the way I do things and on these two counts I could be accused of being very un-feminist as a leader. Do women have to lead like men? Or can we bring our gifts as they are? I think it’s a question of taste and I personally feel that empathy is an asset and we need more women in leadership. Period end of story.”  As for the way in which she and Wyman decided to write Oh’s character, Peet likes the idea that she has something to prove. “Ji-Yoon is hugely driven by her sense of decency and we wanted to explore how she integrates this part of herself into her job.” Back to that need to be liked that so many women struggle with, Peet believes it can actually be a good thing. “That need can be an asset and a driver for success.” She talks about a conversation she recently had with her sister. “She had to take a class for her job on cultural competency, which is an important part of my show. In the class, there was a pie chart divided into sections: what you know, what you don't know and what you don't know you don't know. It’s very difficult for people to admit to that latter portion and in my opinion it should be the biggest part of the pie.”  Also starring in this brilliant ensemble are Holland Taylor, Bob Balaban, Nana Mensah, David Morse, Everly Carganilla and David Duchovny. Joining Peet as executive producer are Oh, Game of Thrones’ David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Bernie Caulfield and Daniel Gray Longino. Writers include Richard E. Robbins, Jennifer Kim and Andrea Troyer. Longino directed all six episodes.   There is so much more story to tell with The Chair. Will there be a second season?

"The Biden administration sued Texas Thursday over the state’s near-total ban on abortion, part of a broader effort by the federal government to fight against the most extreme abortion regulations to take effect since Roe v. Wade—though the lawsuit could be complicated by the law’s novel enforcement approach designed to make it harder for the courts to strike it down. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks at a news conference at the Department of Justice in ... [+] Washington.  U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the Department of Justice had sued Texas because the law violates U.S. Supreme Court precedent stipulating that abortion is legal, alleging the law violates the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause and the 14th Amendment, “is preempted by federal law and violates the doctrine of federal immunity.” Garland also said the Texas law conflicts with federal law by undercutting federal agencies’ authority and preventing them from carrying out certain responsibilities, as well as leaving federal officials open to legal liability, including at such departments as the Department of Labor, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Bureau of Prisons, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Office of Personnel Management. The Texas law, Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), blocks all abortions after a “fetal heartbeat” is detected—a term medical experts criticize as factually misleading—which is approximately six weeks into a pregnancy. The law is expected to be harder to strike down in court than other abortion bans because it can only be enforced by private citizens bringing lawsuits against anyone that “aids and abets” an abortion, rather than the government. The U.S. Supreme Court, for instance, upheld the law by ruling it was too soon to challenge it in court, since it was unclear the defendants in the case “can or will seek to enforce the Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might permit our intervention.” The lawsuit alleges the federal government has the legal standing to block the law, however, arguing the United States “may sue a state to vindicate the rights of individuals” and seeking a court order that would block both the Texas government and private citizens from implementing or enforcing the law. “The United States has the authority and the responsibility to ensure that no state can deprive individuals of their constitutional rights through a legislative scheme specifically designed to prevent the vindication of those rights,” Garland said Thursday, arguing the law’s “scheme” to allegedly deny people their constitutional rights is “one that all Americans, whatever their politics or party, should fear.” Anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life criticized the DOJ’s reported lawsuit ahead of its filing, saying in a statement Thursday the agency “will quickly find that they do not have jurisdiction to stop the Texas Heartbeat Act.” President Joe Biden vowed his administration would take a “whole-of-government effort” to combat the law the day after it took effect on September 1, including directing agencies to determine what “legal tools” the U.S. Department of Justice could use to help fight back against the law. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland then said the DOJ was “urgently” exploring “all options” to defend against the Texas law—which other states are expected to copy—as well as stepping up enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act), which bars efforts to “injure, intimidate or interfere” with people seeking or providing abortions. Congress is also taking action against the law, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has vowed to hold a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would enshrine the right to an abortion in federal law. Though it failed at the U.S. Supreme Court, abortion advocates have had wins in several smaller legal challenges against SB 8. An individual plaintiff was granted a temporary restraining order that blocked anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life from bringing any lawsuits against her under the law, and a court also temporarily barred Texas Right to Life—which helped draft SB 8—from suing Planned Parenthood under the law. Legal experts cited by the Associated Press said those rulings emphasize the trickiness of challenging the law in court, however, since they’re so narrowly tailored they can’t stop any other groups from bringing lawsuits under the law. Texas Right to Life largely shrugged off the Planned Parenthood ruling in a statement, noting the organization remains “undaunted.” “Planned Parenthood can sue us, but they can’t sue every Texan,” the group said in a press release.

Trump’s vendetta against Murkowski began long before she voted for conviction. Last June he vowed to personally campaign against her and endorse any challenger with a “pulse” after Murkowski said she was “struggling” with whether to vote for his reelection. More endorsements are likely to come down as the 2022 campaign heats up. One Republican in Trump’s crosshairs is Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois who, like Cheney, is a vocal critic and sits on a House select committee investigating the January 6 attack.

"Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves in The Matrix (Photo by Ronald Siemoneit/Sygma/Sygma via Getty ... [+] Images) The trailer for the new Matrix sequel, The Matrix Resurrections, looks surprisingly slick; fans are excited to return to the unique world that the Wachowski sisters created.   While the first Matrix film is generally considered to be perfect, the sequels weren’t quite as beloved by audiences, with weighty, wordy philosophy sessions interrupting the pacing, and leaving some viewers confused about what was going on, and how the story ended.  While its difficult to tell if The Matrix Resurrections is continuing the original story, or rebooting the franchise, here’s a reminder of how The Matrix trilogy ended: Neo makes an unusual choice  Despite being hyped up and prophesied as the Messiah of the Matrix, ie, “the One,” Neo eventually learns (via a lengthy, exposition-filled conversation with the Architect) that the Prophecy is merely another illusion, a controlled opposition created by the machines.  The resistance, the One, and even the human city of Zion were all cultivated by the machines to control the percentage of humanity who could see through the illusion of the Matrix, and all are designed to be reset in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection.  Neo learns that the Matrix has gone through 5 cycles, in which he, “the One,” emerges, and inevitably makes the choice to reset the Matrix and allow Zion to be destroyed, in exchange for choosing a handful of humans to rebuild Zion, and the resistance.  If the One rejects this offer, then every single human plugged into the Matrix will be slaughtered, along with Zion and the resistance, resulting in the permanent extinction of all humankind.  Hence, Neo is the 6th incarnation of the One, expected to make the same choice as his predecessors. However, Neo ends up rejecting the machine’s offer and choosing a seemingly irrational path, motivated by his love for Trinity.  Neo’s love differentiates him from his predecessors, and seems to confuse the machines, who operate via pure reason.  Defeating Agent Smith Meanwhile, the Matrix is on the brink of collapse, as Agent Smith has attained a godly level of power and is absorbing the most powerful programs in the Matrix, replicating like a virus. To face him, Neo willingly enters Machine City, to plug into the Matrix. On the way, Trinity is killed.  Once plugged into the Matrix by the machines, Neo fights Agent Smith, for the final time. It soon becomes obvious that the two are perfectly matched, and Neo realizes that he cannot beat Smith. Hence, Neo allows Smith to defeat and absorb him, which results in the machines electrocuting Neo’s physical body, destroying Agent Smith and all of his clones in one giant chain reaction.  Neo has managed to make his own choice, finding a third way, rejecting the machine’s binary of controlled opposition and human extinction.  A new era of peace The destruction of both Neo and Smith results in the Matrix rebooting, with every victim of Smith restored to their original state, and a new peace agreement between Zion and the machines - the machines even promise to allow humans who want to leave the Matrix to do so, freely.  The Matrix has changed; it has lost its signature green tint, seemingly altered by Neo’s sacrifice into a more pleasant environment. It is implied that the machines might have absorbed some of Neo’s humanity, and even incorporated love into their rigid, mathematical perspective.  However, what really happened to the Matrix, and whether the peace between humanity and the machines will last, is unclear. Of course, the ending has been thoroughly dissected by fans, and is still being hotly debated, seeing as several questions were purposely left unanswered.  Some even speculate that Zion was just another level of the Matrix, and that the machines never really relinquished control. In the trailer, we can see that Neo and Trinity are both alive, somehow (and amnesiac), and that the Matrix has broken out of the nineties and has entered the age of smartphones. Are the two even real, or have they been recreated as computer programs? Or did Neo never actually die? The Matrix Resurrections will answer some of these questions, and, most likely, raise many more.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2021/09/09/with-the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-released-heres-a-reminder-of-how-the-matrix-trilogy-ended/,"With ‘The Matrix Resurrections’ Trailer Released, Here’s A Reminder Of How ‘The Matrix’ Trilogy Ended"
"Title IX will be fifty years old next year. In June of next year, Title IX will be fifty years old. The law which makes gender discrimination in educational institutions receiving federal aid illegal. The law has had a massive impact on female participation in organized sports, with myriad salutary health consequences. The gains notwithstanding, today 90 percent intercollegiate athletic programs are still discriminating against women in sport with women being annually short-changed by $1 billion in scholarship dollars and 148,030 participation opportunities. With the market for name, image and likeness (NIL) rights opening up for college students, the imbalance in resources provided to men and women threatens to grow. For the most part, male college athletes benefit from more exposure and publicity than female athletes, making their NILs more valuable in the marketplace. Much of this gender disparity is rooted in the historical under-resourcing of women’s sports. Colleges need to work to balance the scales, so that the longer run NIL market for men and women will gradually equalize. In the short run, greater male notoriety will perpetuate or exacerbate the inequalities. The same issue of under-resourcing the women’s games has also engendered conflict at the professional level. The National Women’s Soccer team wants to achieve equal pay and treatment with the men’s team. The WNBA players, receiving about 20 percent of league revenues, want to get an equal share of league revenues as the NBA players who receive about 50 percent. Yet the WNBA owners claim that even at 20 percent they lose $10 million a year collectively. The general standard is that in a competitive market workers should get paid according to the value they produce, or, in econospeak, the worker should be paid equal to their marginal revenue product. The problem here is that a worker’s market value is a function of many things, including how effectively their sport is promoted and marketed. Conventional wisdom has it that men are better athletes than women. They are stronger, faster and taller. Fans want to see the best athletes, so they prefer and are willing to pay more to watch men compete. But that’s hardly the full story. If sports fans are mainly interested in seeing the best athletes, why does the college sports industry generate more than $12 billion annually? And, at the professional level, why do female tennis players get similar ratings to the men? The men, after all, hit their serves, volleys and rallies faster than the women.  Consider this. The WNBA was founded in 1996. Its intention was to fill the arenas of the NBA teams in the summer time. The women’s American Basketball League (ABL), founded in the same year, played its games in the winter. The WNBA owners had much deeper pockets than those in the ABL, and, hence, were able to outlast it. Basketball spectatorship in US sporting culture is a winter sport. The WNBA never had a business model that was properly focused on the promotion of women’s professional basketball. The League’s weak standing today is largely a function of that under-resourcing. In contrast, women’s tennis has been hugely successful. Why? In large measure, it is because the four main tennis events each year (the grand slam tournaments) are played together with the men and women. They play during the same weeks on the same courts. That is, women benefitted from substantially equal attention to the men on the same grand stage, four times a year. Nothing like this circumstantial equity ever occurred with women’s soccer, basketball or golf. The lesson is clear. Both at the collegiate and professional level, if we want to achieve gender equity, we must dedicate more resources to the promotion and marketing of women’s competitions.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewzimbalist/2021/09/09/title-ix-is-turning-fifty/,"Title IX Is Turning 50, But More Work Remains To Level The Playing Field For Female Athletes"

"Conservatively, Sportradar founder and CEO Carsten Koerl’s 31.8% stake could be worth roughly $2.3 billion, Forbes estimates It’s been a tumultuous 18 months for sports data company Sportradar Group AG. Not only was its business threatened by a global pandemic that ground the sports world to a halt, but a proposed $10 billion SPAC deal to take the company public fell through—all while rival Genius Sports lured away the NFL as a partner. Now, as Switzerland-based Sportradar prepares to go public on the Nasdaq, founder and CEO Carsten Koerl is finally seeing a bright spot, as he will likely emerge as a new billionaire. Sportradar helps leagues compile data, such as in-game statistics, and distribute it to clients like media companies and betting operators. Sports gambling has become an especially strong growth opportunity, following legalization by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. If sports betting becomes operational in all 50 states—it currently is in 26 and Washington, D.C.—the U.S. market alone could exceed $19 billion annually. According to a report by research firm Technavio, the value of the global sports gambling market is expected to expand by more than $140 billion between 2020 and 2025. In an updated prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Sportradar reported that it plans to sell 19 million shares, as well as an additional 2.85 million held under option, at a price of $25 to $28 in its initial public offering. On the low end of its pricing, the 20-year-old company could raise $546 million, valuing it at $7.4 billion. Sportradar also plans to sell a $159 million stake to an investment group headed by Los Angeles Dodgers part owner Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries (Earlier this year, Boehly tried to buy into Sportradar through a SPAC).  While Boehly and other minority investors like basketball legend and Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis stand to gain from Sportradar’s arrival on the public markets, the biggest individual winner here is company founder Koerl. Conservatively, Koerl’s 31.8% stake in Sportradar could be worth roughly $2.3 billion, Forbes estimates. A spokesperson for Sportradar declined to comment. A native of Allgäu, a mountainous region in southern Germany, Koerl—now 56— reportedly had a fascination with sports throughout childhood, harboring ambitions of competing in downhill skiing or professional tennis. However, according to a 2018 article in The Globe and Mail, he pivoted to computer engineering when he realized a future in athletics was unlikely. Koerl studied electronic and microprocessor engineering at the University for Applied Sciences in Konstanz, Germany and held several management roles in the software and gaming industries before founding online gambling company bwin (then called betandwin) in 1997. He took the company public on the Austrian Stock Exchange in March 2000. In 2001, Koerl formed Sportradar by buying 51% of a nascent Norwegian sports betting odds and data company called Market Monitor AS. It has since expanded globally, including into the U.S. in 2014. In 2018, Silicon Valley investment firm TCV and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board teamed up to buy a reported 37% stake in Sportradar, valuing the company at $2.5 billion including debt. According to the company’s prospectus, Sportradar posted a nearly $18 million net profit on $478 million in revenue last year. Despite losing the NFL’s data rights license to rival Genius Sports earlier this year (the NFL still retains an equity stake of less than 5% in Sportradar as part of an earlier agreement), Sportradar has established partnerships with the NBA, MLB, NHL and Nascar, among others (the NHL also received equity options for Sportradar’s IPO as part of its deal, according to Sportico). Some of Sportradar’s media and gambling clients include Facebook, Google, FanDuel, DraftKings and William Hill, and it also provides services for notable organizations such as the Union of European Football Associations (known as UEFA) and the German Bundesliga. When Sportradar debuts on the Nasdaq, it’ll complete a strenuous journey to the public markets. In March, the company had a deal in place to merge with Horizon II, a SPAC owned by Boehly, which would have valued Sportradar at $10 billion. After a delay in bridge financing caused the deal to fall through, Sportradar changed course and filed for a traditional IPO in August. It will trade under the ticker “SRAD.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2021/09/09/anticipated-ipo-of-sports-data-giant-sportradar-likely-to-mint-new-billionaire/,IPO Of Sports Data Giant Sportradar Likely To Mint New Billionaire
"VIVO - (L-R) GABI (voiced by Ynairaly Simo) and VIVO (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda). ©2021 SPAI. All Rights Reserved. In Nielsen ratings for the week of August 9 through August 15, Sony Animation’s Vivo was the top movie for the second-straight frame. The Netflix acquisition, helmed by Space Chimps/The Croods director Kirk DeMicco and written by DeMicco and In the Heights co-writer Quiara Alegría Hudes, earned a whopping 802 million minutes in its second frame (and first full week). That’s a jump of 62% from its “opening weekend.” That translates into around nine million viewings of the 99-minute feature (whose credits begin at 86 minutes), and another “win” for the slew of Sony Animation flicks (Mitchells Vs. the Machines, Wish Dragon, etc.) which were leased to Netflix (save for Chinese theatrical distribution) as a result of the pandemic. Of note, half of Vivo’s audience came from kids 2-11 while 1/3 came from Hispanic households.  The film doubled the next “most-watched” movie, namely the opening weekend of The Kissing Booth 3. The threequel, which shot back-to-back with its sequel (which turned out to be a smart move when Covid shut down production worldwide), earned a still-solid 451 million minutes. That translates into around 4.1 million viewings of the 113-minute Joey King/Jacob Elordi rom-com melodrama. The trilogy, based on a literary series that began life on then-15-year-old Beth Reekles’s WattPad, has been one of Netflix’s flagship “new” franchises, a center piece of their “summer of love” 2018 blitz that featured a handful of high-profile “like Hollywood used to make” romantic comedies. The Kissing Booth: Joey King as Shelly 'Elle' Evans, Jacob Elordi as Noah Flynn, Meganne Young as Rachel, Joel Courtney as Lee Flynn in 'The Kissing Booth 3'. Whether you prefer The Kissing Booth or Set It Up or To All the Boys I’ve Loved, the mini-spree showed that Netflix could successfully approximate the old-school rom-com, a genre that theatrical Hollywood had decided was too un-cool to pursue (that an entire generation of young actresses were raised to think of Katherine Heigl/Jennifer Aniston romantic comedies as “less than” didn’t help). This was right as, ironically, Crazy Rich Asians became a theatrical blockbuster ($237 million worldwide, including $170 million domestic, on a $35 million budget) at least partially because the Constance Wu/Henry Golding “hijinks with my boyfriend’s rich relatives” was a distinctly old-fashioned studio programmer.  This specific “new to you” franchise was essentially taking the Twilight/Fifty Shades formula (an intelligent but inexperienced young female lead tries to woo an older, darker, brooding hunk and gets to indulge as she fends off a potential rival suitor who isn’t taking rejection all that well) and setting it in “real-world” (and more sex-positive) environment. Yes, that’s a compliment, because it’s a solid “rip-off, don’t remake” success story. Whether we like the movies or not (it helped that Elordi’s “not-Edward” became a lot less scarily angry in the sequels), there were a clear case of Netflix being able to find success with a star-driven, high-concept, new-to-you adaptation that found success not through nostalgia or IP awareness but through today’s kids discovering it today. That’s why I get so cranky when Netflix spends time and money on an Addison Rae-fronted, gender-swapped He’s All That. Folks may watch, but Netflix, of all the streamers, doesn’t have to rely on “IP for the sake of IP” rehashes. Anyway, Disney’s Luca logged another 372 million views on Disney+, actually rising 11% from last week’s 336 million-minute “performance.” It’s quite clear that the “was supposed to be in theaters” Pixar gem may become a perennial favorite for Disney+ alongside Moana and (thus far) Raya and the Last Dragon. Both films logged around 145 million minutes. Jungle Cruise Disney’s Jungle Cruise plunged 48% in its third frame, logging “just” 213 million views and again suggesting that most folks who purchase a big Disney+ “Premier Access” title do so in the first two weeks. Even more than Black Widow, I’d give your left eyeball to get the post-debut Premier Access revenue for this one, as I have to think it’d be leggier than the MCU flick even though the Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt comic fantasy “opened” with half the Scarlett Johansson film’s $60 million Premier Access debut. We’re allegedly (for now) getting a sequel, so either the numbers are solid or Disney really wants a new live-action franchise and the illusion of a theaters/Disney+ success story.  Meanwhile, Beckett, a distinctly old-school “innocent man on the run” thriller starring John David Washington, debuted with a decent 335 million minutes. That’s around 3.1 million views of Ferdinando Cito Filomarino’s political melodrama (about a vacationing American in trouble during a time of political unrest in Greece). It’s the kind of movie that in normal pre-streaming times would have been a Focus Features-released “end-of-summer thriller for adults” for Labor Day weekend, and it would have been thrilled with a $10-$15 million Wed-Mon debut. I liked it well enough for what it is, and it was mostly successful in the whole “approximating a real Hollywood studio programmer” department.  Among older “forgotten” movies, Damon Wayans’ Major Payne nabbed 335 million minutes and Sandra Bullock’s The Net (which is both of its time and was ahead of its time) earned 143 million minutes, both on Netflix. Finally, in a case of Netflix truly giving a bigger audience to an otherwise under-the-radar flick, The Paper Tigers nabbed 131 million minutes. Bao Tran’s years-in-the-making passion project (he claims to have turned down earlier attempts to make the movie with famous white actors like Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage in favor of the cast he desired) is a charming and enjoyable comic actioner.  The film concerns three lifelong friends who grew up as kung fu prodigies have grown into past-their-prime middle-aged men, who now reunite to investigate the mysterious death of their childhood teacher. It’s neither as farcical as Mystery Team nor as grim as The Kid Detective and the 108-minute offering is an easy recommendation for kids who really liked Shang-Chi but are too young for The Protector, House of Flying Daggers or The Raid. I can’t say I expect it (or Beckett) to stick around on these charts, as evidenced by their quick disappearance from the “Netflix top ten.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/09/nielsens-kissing-booth-3-and-paper-tigers-impress-on-netflix--but-jungle-cruise-drops-48-on-disney/,Nielsen’s: ‘Kissing Booth 3’ And ‘Paper Tigers’ Impress As ‘Jungle Cruise’ Drops 48%
"Republicans & Democrats have worked together in 2021 to enact state level reforms that expand access ... [+] to health care and reduce costs.  As Texas demonstrated this past summer, the national media loves to cover state legislation related to election law and abortion. What doesn’t get as much press, though it is deserving of it, is the way in which Democrats and Republicans in many state capitals are working together this year to expand access to health care by reducing or repealing certificate of need requirements, which are regulatory barriers that impede growth in the supply of health care and inflate costs.  The latest example of such bipartisan cooperation comes from North Carolina, where Governor Roy Cooper (D) signed Senate Bill 462 into law on August 30. SB 462, which was approved with bipartisan support in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly, raises the value threshold above which a state issued certificate of need (CON) is required for the installation of new medical equipment. SB 462 also establishes a time frame under which a CON must be approved or denied.  The way CON regulations work is that health care providers who want to expand existing medical services or offer new ones must first prove to state regulators that there is a need. Those tasked with granting a certificate of need include competing health care providers, creating an inherent conflict of interest. It would strike many as crazy to require that any time McDonalds 
  
  MCD 
  wants to open a new location it must seek permission from the local Burger King, but that’s analogous to the way in which CON regulations work.  “Though states approach it differently, these certificates are required for everything from beds and burn care units to dialysis clinics and drug abuse therapies,” explains Matt Mitchell, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. “Providers can wait months or years. The process can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and compliance costs.” 35 states have CON requirements on the books today. As with nationwide efforts to reduce the amount of occupational licensing requirements that serve as barriers to employment, there is also growing bipartisan recognition that CON mandates unjustly restrict the supply of health care and should be repealed or reformed. Lawmakers in 10 states (Alabama, Alaska, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia) introduced legislation in 2021 to partially or fully repeal CON regulations. “In many of these states,” notes Mitchell, “the momentum seems to be moving in the direction of something big happening in the next few years.”  Demonstrating the potential for bipartisan cooperation on this issue, the need to repeal or reform CON requirements was a rare instance of agreement between the Obama and Trump administrations.  “CON laws, when first enacted, had the laudable goals of reducing health care costs and improving access to care,” noted a January 11, 2016 joint statement of the Federal Trade Commission and President Obama’s Department of Justice, which was sent to South Carolina legislators regarding CON reform under consideration at the time. “However, after considerable experience, it is now apparent that CON laws can prevent the efficient functioning of health care markets…the Agencies historically have suggested that states consider repeal or retrenchment of their CON laws.”  The Obama administration’s criticism of state CON mandates and recognition of the harm they cause was echoed years later by the Trump administration: “Available evidence suggests that CON laws have failed to produce cost savings, higher quality healthcare, or greater access to care, whether in underserved communities or in underserved areas,” stated a joint report released on November 30, 2018 by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Labor. The adverse effects of CON regulations are well documented.  “Controlling for other factors, researchers find that the average patient in a CON state has access to fewer hospitals, fewer hospice care facilities, fewer dialysis clinics and fewer ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs),” notes the Mercatus Center’s Mitchell. “There are fewer beds in these states and fewer medical imaging devices.” Of the 35 states with CON requirements, governors in 24 of them temporarily suspended CON mandates in 2020 after the onset of the pandemic. While the problems caused by CON requirements have become more evident during the pandemic, there is also growing recognition among state legislators that these regulations have adverse effects outside of a pandemic and should thus be permanently repealed. The logic behind efforts to make these temporary suspensions permanent is, if a CON requirement is unduly restricting the supply of health care in an emergency, it must also be artificially limiting supply during normal times and unnecessarily driving up the cost of care. ""The real damage in the certificate of need is in the unseen, the denial of care and the inflation of cost in healthcare,” South Carolina Senator Wes Climer (R) said during a May hearing on legislation to repeal South Carolina’s CON requirements.  “This system is so broken, the concept is so deeply flawed,” Senator Climer added. “If our interest is expanding access and lowering cost, there are no other options besides complete repeal.”  CON laws’ association with reduced access to health care is evident. According to a study from the Mercatus Center, states with CON requirements have 30% fewer hospitals per 100,000 people. This translates into CON states averaging 131 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 residents than states lacking CON requirements. States with CON requirements also tend to have fewer rural hospitals.  North Carolina Senator Joyce Krawiec (R), who sponsored the aforementioned CON reform recently enacted by Governor Cooper, also introduced legislation to repeal CON requirements outright. That bill, SB 309, didn’t advance this year, but is expected to be reintroduced in a future legislative session, perhaps as soon as 2022.  As they have in other states, the Federal Trade Commission has expressed support in the past for repealing North Carolina’s CON requirements entirely. In 2015 the FTC sent a letter to North Carolina lawmakers noting that “CON laws can restrict entry and expansion, limit consumer choice, and stifle innovation,” and that “the CON process can be exploited by firms to thwart or delay entry by new competitors and can obstruct efforts to restore competition that has been lost to an anticompetitive merger.”  North Carolina wasn’t the only state where legislators took action to repeal or reform CON mandates this year. Next door in Tennessee, state lawmakers enacted Senate Bill 1281, which exempts hospitals in the state’s most economically distressed counties from the certificate of need requirements. SB 1281, which was signed into law by Governor Bill Lee (R) on May 26, also seeks to modernize and streamline the CON approval process. This reform combines two oversight bodies into one and also lowered the population threshold for exempted counties. CON requirements were also repealed for psychiatric services and hospitals are now allowed to operate nonresidential substance abuse centers without applying for a new CON. “This is going to relieve one of those impediments [to health care providers],” Tennessee Senator Page Wally (R) said when SB 1281 was passed in May. Wally notes that SB 1281 will make it so health care providers “are not going to have to go through that multi-month or even year process.” Virginia lawmakers also passed legislation this year (SB764 and Chapter 227) to exclude some facilities from CON requirements. In Washington State lawmakers passed SB 5236, which extends the state’s temporary CON suspension through June 2023. In the same month that Tennessee lawmakers passed their reform, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte (R) and the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted a bill that repealed all but one CON requirement, that for long-term care (or nursing home).  “By repealing CON regulations, permanently expanding telehealth and authorizing Direct Patient Care, Montana’s leadership have ushered in one of the most dramatic expansions of healthcare access in recent memory,” said Kendall Cotton, President and CEO of Montana’s Frontier Institute. The Mercatus Center’s Mitchell calls the bill Governor Gianforte signed “the most significant reform in any state in recent years.” Media outlets may like to cover conflict, but the way in which Republican and Democratic lawmakers are working together to remove or ease CON regulations that restrict access to health care and drive up costs deserves more media coverage in the future. Even though most state legislatures have adjourned for the year, it’s clear that bipartisan interest in and efforts to repeal CON mandates will continue into 2022 and beyond.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2021/09/09/tearing-down-regulations-that-restrict-the-supply-of-health-care-has-become-a-bipartisan-affair/,Tearing Down Regulations That Restrict The Supply Of Health Care Has Become A Bipartisan Affair
" The baby whose conception led to the Supreme Court case that established the right to have an abortion in the U.S. publicly revealed her identity for the first time Thursday, describing the emotional weight she carried being “the Roe baby,” touted for decades as a powerful symbol of one of the most divisive debates in American society. Attorney Gloria Allred and Norma McCorvey during a pro-choice rally on July 4, 1989 in Burbank, ... [+] California. Shelley Lynn Thornton, now a 51-year-old woman, revealed her name and spoke to the press on-the-record for the first time in an excerpt of the upcoming book “The Family Roe: An American Story,” published Thursday in The Atlantic by journalist Joshua Prager, who has been in contact with Thornton since 2012. Thornton said she learned of her connection to the Roe case when she was 18 years old after being tracked down by a private investigator hired by The National Enquirer, a tabloid that teamed up with her birth mother Norma McCorvey, known as “Jane Roe,” to find her daughter as part of a publicity stunt when McCorney began trying to earn money as a pro-choice speaker. Thornton, who was raised to oppose abortion, said she took the news badly and that the only thing she knew about the case or her birth mother at the time was that McCorvey “had made it okay for people to go out and be promiscuous,” though her view has changed over time, she said. She said she’s been pressured for years by both anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates to join their respective causes but says that she doesn’t identify with either label, adding that while she chose not to terminate an unplanned pregnancy at age 20, she doesn’t understand why abortion should be a government concern. Thornton and McCorvey had a complicated relationship and never met in person before McCorvey died in Texas in 2017, Thornton said, citing her birth mother’s wish to use their relationship to generate publicity, which ran against Thornton’s hope for a private life. Thornton later changed her mind, saying she was tired of keeping the secret of her ties to Roe v. Wade and the hold it had on her life, and explaining it caused her a lot of anxiety and made her afraid to pursue friendships over fear of being found out. “Secrets and lies are, like, the two worst things in the whole world,” Thornton told Prager the first time they met in 2012. “I’m keeping a secret, but I hate it.” Thorton revealed her identity amid a new push against abortion led by Texas, the same state where Roe v. Wade originated. In May, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a bill that effectively bans abortion at six weeks, before many find out they’re pregnant. To enforce the law, private citizens will be able to sue anyone who helped secure an abortion in civil court for up to $10,000. The law will make 85% of abortions performed in the state illegal, experts say. The legislation took effect last week after the Supreme Court declined to block the law in a 5-4 vote, though the issue could come back to the court in the future. Republicans in Florida have indicated they plan to introduce a similar bill. The landmark Roe V. Wade case issued its ruling on abortion in 1973, three years after McCorvey, then a waitress in Dallas, sued Texas officials in order to terminate her pregnancy. Thorton’s adoption was arranged by Dallas attorney Henry Mc­Cluskey, who introduced McCorvey to Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, the two lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff to challenge Texas’ abortion law and later filed a lawsuit on McCorvey’s behalf and argued in front of the Supreme Court. McCorvey has a complicated legacy on both sides of the abortion debate. She first worked as a pro-choice advocate before switching sides in 1995 after becoming a born-again Christian. McCorvey earned nearly $500,000 from anti-abortion groups, according to AKA Jane Roe, a documentary released last year. However, shortly before her death in 2017, McCorvey told filmmakers she had never been against abortion at all: “If a young woman wants to have an abortion, that’s no skin off my ass. That’s why they call it choice,” McCorvey said, adding that she “took their money and they’d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say … it was all an act.” McCorvey’s oldest daughter Melissa Mills, who like her two half-sisters was adopted, spoke to CBS News for an interview that will air Friday. In clips released Thursday, Melissa said their mother never had an abortion and was largely left out of the Roe v. Wade push, saying McCorvey did not present as ”the type of person they needed.” Jane Roe’s Baby Tells Her Story (The Atlantic)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/09/09/roe-baby-speaks-out-for-the-first-time-amid-renewed-abortion-debate/,‘Roe Baby’ Speaks Out For The First Time Amid Renewed Abortion Debate

"Pretty much every 9/11 story is personal. This one is different: it looks through the lens of an entire cohort. For the 30 days after the Twin Towers fell, I tagged along daily, amid the smoldering rubble, with the 52 surviving employees at the May Davis Group, doomed tenants of the 87th floor of One World Trade Center. They were involuntarily testing whether an organization that, in the pre-cloud/pre-smartphone era, lost everything instantly – all records, contacts and, yes, their most valuable employee – could even continue to exist. When the story appeared in the print edition of Worth Magazine in November 2001, it attracted a good amount of buzz. And then it vanished just as quickly. If you checked earlier this week – and our research team tried and tried — there was no digital record, or version in a database, or copy in a print archive. Like so much from that terrible day, it had disappeared. But as with pretty much anything pertaining to 9/11, if you look closely enough, there’s always hope. In this case, one surviving copy buried in a storage closet. Below, a story of human resilience that hasn’t been told in 20 years. Owen May had always been quick with numbers, but in his shock on the morning of September 11, he didn’t trust his own math. May’s semi-eponymous investment bank, the May Davis Group, occupied the 87th floor of One World Trade Center. He stood on Vesey Street, directly below his building, watching the top floors spit out black ash like an angry coal oven. May counted up from the lobby, past Bank of America and the Port Authority, until he came to the 82nd floor, above which the smoke and flames became all-consuming. In disbelief, he counted down from Windows on the World until he found the same floor. He recounted several times. Up. Down. Either way, it didn’t add up to 87. May’s cell phone stopped working, so he borrowed one from the bus driver gaping next to him and called his partner, Kevin Davis, who works from a satellite office in Baltimore. “Kevin, it’s right where we are,” he screamed. “I don’t think everyone’s going to make it.” May had already called upstairs and learned that 13 of his 53 employees had arrived. He would have been up there himself if he hadn’t hit the snooze bar on his alarm clock, one of fate’s little miracles; instead, he was 30 seconds from driving his car into the building’s infamous parking garage when the first plane hit. College buddies, May and Davis started their firm in 1993 with the dream of building their own home on Wall Street, in part to take advantage of new opportunities for African-American bankers. They had nurtured the firm like a precious baby, nursing it countless times though all-night deal closings. The World Trade Towers and Statue of Liberty at sunset, viewed from New Jersey. Their move into the Twin Towers five years ago proudly signaled the company’s adulthood. May Davis, the partners would gleefully note to anyone who would listen, may not have been the biggest, but it was surely the highest minority-owned firm in the world. The firm prominently displayed the Twin Towers on its Web site, on its business cards, and in its brochures. As much for themselves as for important out-of-town clients to whom they showed off the office, the prominence of the World Trade Center was interwoven with the partners’ identities. Unlike some big tenants such as Morgan Stanley, May Davis had no other facilities that could absorb its operations after the attack. The Twin Towers were May Davis. And there was only so much time that it could reasonably expect to hold together its fragile coalition of customers, employees, and capital before all would scatter and the firm would be left an empty shell. The first 30 days after the disaster would largely make or break the firm. The partners, especially Owen May, would have to successfully navigate a maze of urgent issues. How do you run a business that no longer has working telephone numbers, computers, or a place to congregate? How do you run a business that no longer has contact lists or payroll tallies, client data or tax returns, records of what is owed or records of what is due? How do you run a money business that can no longer readily access money, a sales operation that has no way to sell, a trading operation missing its head trader? May wakes up after a surprisingly sound sleep. A frenetic man, even for hyperactive Wall Street, the investment banker hurriedly showers and puts on his suit before grasping the new reality: He has nowhere to go. May takes account of what he knows. The vast majority of his colleagues have survived. That in itself is a miracle: The 87th floor of the north tower was squarely in the death zone. May Davis’s immediate upstairs neighbors are quickly becoming a who’s who of the corporate cursed: Cantor Fitzgerald, Marsh & McLennan, Carr Futures. Combined, those three firms are missing more than a thousand employees. May Davis is missing only two people: Jason Braunstein, a trainee; and Harry Ramos, the head trader. Three numbers explain their luck: 90 feet (the distance between May Davis and the flight path of American Airlines Flight 11), 180 degrees (the firm’s offices took up the southwest corner, while the plane came from the northeast) and 30 minutes (the crash came at 8:48 a.m., when three fourths of the firm’s staff wasn’t in yet). Instinctively—he averages 5,000 minutes a month—May reaches for his cell phone. For 24 hours, May Davis employees have been frantically calling each other, battling the crippled communications system, trying to establish everyone’s whereabouts. May spends much of the day talking with Ramos’s wife, Migdalia, or Mickey. He’s known Harry Ramos for a decade (May is partial to hiring trusted associates, including two childhood pals). Ramos was single-handedly responsible for nearly one third of the firm’s revenue. Mickey Ramos is alternately distraught and resilient as the pair coordinate a sweep of Manhattan hospitals. May’s chief deputy, managing director Michael Jacobs, a no-bull Queens native known ubiquitously as Red for his flaming carrot top and goatee, spends much of the day with two associates, including a physician-turned-broker named Kage Merkel, at St. Vincent’s and Bellevue hospitals looking to match various John Does with Harry Ramos. No luck. By nightfall, Braunstein is able to get a call out. He has just been released from a Brooklyn hospital, suffering from severe dust inhalation and a corneal abrasion. Ramos, however, still hasn’t turned up, and Owen May fears the worst. For many at the firm, the day after proves as traumatic as the day itself, and each discovers his or her own way to cope. May retreats into television news, where he views the collapse time and again. Merkel confronts the change in his life by storming off to a hair salon and ordering his brown locks dyed platinum blond. One of the senior officers, Adam Mayblum, who was with Ramos the previous morning, decides to emote, pounding out a stream-of-consciousness e-mail to friends. The gist of that e-mail follows: Outside it looked like a ticker tape parade. Inside, the May Davis offices were filling quickly with thick, white smoke. No one had seen the airplane, so while the building swayed 20 feet back and forth, everyone assumed it was a bomb. The phones were working, so both Ramos and Mayblum left messages for their wives, then moved out. The 78th floor required a switch of stairwells, and for a while, the pair directed traffic. Then Mayblum went down stairwell A, and Ramos followed a few flights behind. On the 53rd floor, Mayblum came across a heavyset man named Victor, who couldn’t move. He offered to help, but Victor instead asked him to send for rescuers. When Ramos came across Victor a few minutes later, he insisted on staying with him—if you asked Ramos for a ride, he would loan you his car. Joined by another colleague, Hong Zhu, Ramos nudged Victor down another flight, then they all rode an elevator to the 44th-floor sky lobby. Back into the stairwell they went, ever so slowly creeping down the steps. Somewhere around the 39th floor, they felt the force of the adjacent south tower collapsing. This left them 30 minutes to get out. Victor, however, remained nearly immobile. “Lean on me,” Ramos implored. But Victor couldn’t do it. Firemen running up the stairs ordered the May Davis duo to leave Victor and get themselves out. Zhu heeded their call, exiting the building 10 minutes ahead of the collapse. The last words he heard from Ramos came echoing from behind. “Victor, don’t worry. I’m with you.” May’s office at the World Trade Center overlooked the Statue of Liberty, which is appropriate because his hiring philosophy would make Emma Lazarus proud, with a heavy dose of alumni from mediocre colleges, doomed firms, and the school of hard knocks. Wall Street wasn’t particularly welcoming to the 42-year-old May. His first job, even with his Duke M.B.A., was a $4-an-hour entry-level position at Lehman Brothers. So along with Davis, 44, he created the financial world’s Island of Misfit Toys, a dysfunctional family that somehow managed to work. Davis and May played this family’s stern father and frazzled mother, respectively. The pair—among the few African-American business students at the University of Miami—bonded, and their two-decade relationship has had the same strains as a marriage. Ask either one about the other and he’ll invariably roll his eyes. May’s scoop on Davis: a pompous stick-in-the-mud from irrelevant Baltimore who kisses a mean ass. Davis’s scoop on May: foul-mouthed, loud, cheap—a typical New Yorker. Both are plenty smart, and as in most good partnerships (and good marriages), their respective strengths salve their weaknesses, while their long history prevents serious friction. May Davis may not have been the biggest, but it was surely the highest minority-owned firm in the world. The firm prominently displayed the Twin Towers on its website, on its business cards, and in its brochures.  The whole May Davis family has come to May’s suburban house on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. Emotions come pouring out easily: hugs, kisses, and tears. Harry Ramos still hasn’t turned up. The two partners have enlisted six grief counselors, including Lutheran and Episcopal ministers, who spend much of their time listening and nodding. May addresses the group, offering words of encouragement. “We’ve got priests, we’ve got liquor, we’ve got a spare bedroom,” he says. “Do what you have to do, because these are strange times.” May copes by pushing aside his feelings and closely attending to numerous family members of his lost associate. The person drawing the most attention is Mickey Ramos, who carries a World Trade Center floor plan and calmly quizzes everyone about where and when they last saw her husband. The second-most-watched person, however, is someone not even affiliated with the firm, someone who found the gathering as a result of Mayblum’s e-mail, which has proliferated faster than a tasteless joke. (Eventually he received more than 1,000 responses.) At 3 a.m., a woman named Rebecca had frantically called Mayblum’s house. She’s the wife of a heavyset man named Victor, who, like Harry Ramos, has yet to return from the Twin Towers. She shows Mayblum a picture of her Victor; Mayblum’s face indicates that it’s the same man. Rebecca looks stoic, comforted by the thought that, contrary to her worst fears, Victor did not die alone. It’s Mayblum who starts bawling. EMPLOYEES, COMPETITORS, AND CLIENTS ALIKE HAVE GIVEN May Davis a grace period, but as Owen May sits in his dentist’s chair, in a vain attempt to foster the illusion of normalcy, a cell phone call ends the honeymoon. On the line is the chief executive of a California-based Internet security company. May Davis had been in the process of delivering to it a $200,000 cash infusion, plus a $5 million credit line—money the Internet company had been desperately counting on. But now all that paperwork is smoldering at ground zero. There will be no money for the time being. May holds the cell phone from his ear and lets the Internet executive vent. “My hands are tied about this,” May says. But his assurances come with the air of someone who has far bigger problems. If you were to summarize May Davis’s pre-September 11 revenue model, you could carve it into three equal parts: financing deals, over-the-counter trading, and institutional sales. Restarting the firm’s finance business will prove the most time-critical issue.   May Davis has developed a highly profitable niche: distressed public companies that have burned through their underwriters. “If you can get better terms from Goldman Sachs, go to Goldman Sachs,” shrugs Red Jacobs, who oversees most of these offerings. May Davis attempts to save babies from bath water, tapping into a pool of money sources it has nurtured. These are mostly small funds and wealthy individuals, including a healthy dose of royals from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. The loans convert to stock at a premium of about 20 percent. For its part, May Davis receives a fee of up to 10 percent, and sometimes stock warrants, as a sweetener. These companies are often desperate, however, and the deals are perishable. Deals that May Davis loses will be business that the firm sorely needs. This has already been a lousy year at May Davis, as it has been for most investment banks. The company cut 30 positions after reaching its high-water mark. Revenue has been coming in well below last year’s $16 million pace, and the firm has been losing money for the first time since its inception. In July, May Davis, without admitting wrongdoing, agreed to a $10,000 fine to the National Association of Securities Dealers for failing to record trading orders in a timely manner. Just the day before the attack, the company also had finally settled a long, bitter legal dispute with the Wall Street firm S.G. Cowen, a battle that sucked up tremendous amounts of time and badly hurt the firm. By mid-morning, May is on his way back into Manhattan for the time since the attack but with bigger problems than ever. As May walks down Wall Street, in front of the J.P. Morgan building, his cell phone rings. It’s one of the young brokers. “I need my paycheck,” the broker says bluntly. May Davis has furloughed its entire staff, encouraging everyone to go on unemployment until the firm can regroup. May tries to explain the situation: The company has no handle on what everyone is earning, no Social Security numbers, no checks to write. When the response is a veiled threat to sue, May, who even in normal times issues a profanity with every third word, curses up and down Wall Street. “You don’t do that to someone who lost everything,” May says after he hangs up. May’s right-hand man, Jacobs, later follows up with the broker. Jacobs had been stuck in an elevator when the plane hit, waiting an hour for help and finally prying the doors open himself with just a few minutes to spare. He’s in no mood for squabbling, and he tells the broker to find another job, the first post-September 11 employment casualty. May, meanwhile, has arrived at his destination: 120 Broadway, a 40-story building dating back to 1915, one of Manhattan’s original skyscrapers, which on this day earns the distinction of being the closest office tower to ground zero allowed to reopen. He proceeds to the 28th floor, where he’s introduced to Mark Goldwasser, president of Olympic Cascade Financial, which operates a brokerage called National Securities. A mutual business associate put the two together, knowing that May Davis was looking for space and that National Securities had extra room. “If there’s anything I can do to help you out, it will be my pleasure,” Goldwasser says, with the soft accent of someone who grew up in the former Rhodesia. He brings May to an abandoned corner of a trading floor. It’s his as long as he needs it, gratis, one of 10,000 kind deeds done in the city that day. Later, Goldwasser, who had watched the mayhem of September 11 from his aerial perch just two blocks away, explains the simple origin of his offer: “There but for the grace of God go I.” BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, IN A COUNTRY SO BORED THAT television was dominated by shows that created scenarios of mock adversity, May had a dream: He would be a contestant on Survivor. So last spring, he had a digital video camera follow him around the office. “Welcome to my world,” he told the camera as he staged a sequence in which he barked orders, cut a million-dollar deal, and handled half a dozen emergencies. “Mentally, all I do is strategize,” he said. “Physically, I have to perform CPR on myself.” The video cuts to May in a camouflage outfit, giving the producers a stern look. “Let’s get busy,” he says. Although May didn’t make the show’s cast, his home video is significant for more than its irony or its glimpse into his pre-September 11 audacity: it is the only surviving visual record of May Davis’s old offices. The firm’s space was sprawling, at 14,000 square feet—a kingly amount for some 50-odd employees. Support workers sat in the middle in low-walled cubicles, and the perimeter offices had glass interior walls that let all enjoy the 180-degree views of New York Harbor. From May’s corner office, you could look through the slit windows, past the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, all the way, it seemed, to Davis’s Baltimore branch. Or you could gaze westward over the Hudson River and across the mainland United States, like the famous Steinberg cartoon in which Manhattan dominates the globe and everywhere else is just a dot.     While on the phone, May eyes a planter, and within the planter, he finds an electrical outlet. His mind starts racing: I could plug in my phone and conduct business right here. With phone service nearly impossible, the partners finally tell everyone to work from home until Monday, but May makes a mental note. In a pinch, a planter at Chase Manhattan Plaza could be his office.  From National Securities’ offices on the 28th floor, a smattering of May Davis staffers who have chosen to preview their new digs look out over quite a different view. Through the soot-covered window, they gaze down upon ground zero, which smolders like an angry volcano. The space itself is nothing fancy: a quiet corner of the trading floor, 1,500 square feet, comprising one row of work spaces and a few desks.  May looks across the space and envisions how his firm will operate. He can foresee restarting institutional trading. But without Harry Ramos, getting back to business in OTC is a conundrum. A bad trader mistake could wipe out the company.  May wants to make the new space functional as quickly as possible. “Where are the Israelis?” he shouts. The Israelis are Terrence Julius and Adam Shuster, the co-founders of a company called TeleVend that May Davis incubated and helped raise $1 million. Veteran Israeli army officers, the pair came up with a way to buy soda or candy from a vending machine using a cell phone. This market can wait, however: Julius and Shuster are now the technology department. Tapping their back office in Jerusalem, they’re working to reconnect May Davis with the outside world. Together they try to calm the staffers with stories of terrorism close calls. “Congratulations,” Shuster smiles. “You’re all Israelis now.”    KEVIN DAVIS HATES NEW YORK CITY, AND HE HATES NEW Yorkers: the cockiness, the rudeness, the cutthroat attitude. It’s why he rarely visits the New York City flagship and steadfastly keeps his little Baltimore office, which serves congenial clients such as the state of Maryland. September 11 and its aftermath may have created a few million “I Love New York” converts across the country, but the best Davis is willing to do on his first visit since the disaster is “I don’t hate New York quite as much.”  The three guys Davis starts the day with embody every New York stereotype he disdains, even if they are technically from Connecticut. They represent the firm of Giordano Associates, an independent insurance adjuster. The idea of an insurance adjuster is a bit of a misnomer. Adjust implies a slight alteration in one direction or another. These guys are here to make sure May Davis’s insurance company, Chubb, adjusts the number in only one direction: north. May Davis cofounder Kevin Davis never liked New York, choosing instead to work from a small office in Baltimore. That office became even more critical in the weeks after the terrorist attacks. Their pitch is polished, their look and demeanor straight out of central casting. The salesman wears a cheap gray suit, which matches his prematurely graying hair. He throws out insurance lingo the way Joe Torre might discuss baseball. “You guys are in a catastrophe situation,” he says. “I used to do a lot of cat work.” Suddenly, every sentence has cat in it. The boss wears a dark navy custom-tailored suit, which matches his wet, jet-black hair. He blathers about all his connections: the member of the Republic National Committee, the powerful Democratic state legislator in Connecticut…. Their lawyer looks like a squirrel and rarely opens his mouth, though when he does, the rest take notes. As Davis, May, Jacobs, and the May Davis lawyer, Adam Goldberg, listen intently, they get to the point: To get the serious dough, you need to get your claim in early. Chubb will be looking to get settlements out of the way but will dig in as losses mount and stragglers file claims. “For the first 200 guys through the door, it’s Christmastime,” says the salesman in gray. “Everybody’s a salesman,” May replies. “Just because you guys have nice suits and pretty ties doesn’t mean anything. I need the money, I need it fast, and we want it done right.” After some tense back and forth, the May Davis team excuses itself. As the four huddle, Davis seems ambivalent. He’s most concerned about beating them down on their fee. “They’re at 10 percent,” he says. “Let’s get them down to 7.5.” May doesn’t trust these guys at all. “I want references,” he says, over and over; Goldberg repeatedly vouches for them. The four bicker for five minutes before Davis waves his hand, his tacit approval given: “You guys live the nightmare.” After a private unity dinner with Jesse Jackson and a dozen other African-American leaders at the New York Hilton (“Burdens to share make them easier to bear,” Reverend Jackson intones in a prayer for both May Davis and Harry Ramos), Davis leaves town and doesn’t return for a month. IT FEELS AS IF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IS STILL FALLING down on Owen May. One of Verizon’s major switching facilities was severely damaged on September 11. Phone service throughout lower Manhattan is unreliable. National Securities has just 12 lines in operation and can spare only one, which works only sporadically. So the dozen staffers who have filed in use cell phones. These devices can be frustrating in normal times, but when it’s your business lifeline and you’re working from the 28th floor of a building that gets lousy reception, the situation is maddening. This holds particularly true for May, the manic cell phone user, who has his mobile number posted on various emergency-related Web sites as May Davis’s de facto headquarters. “How’s the environment up here?” May shouts at the first of 50 callers that day. “There is no environment up here! I’m swimming upstream here.” Jacobs finds May and runs down transactions they had been near closing, including deals with Flexxtech and 5 G Wireless Communications. Still another California company is complaining. “He ain’t going nowhere,” May snarls.  Jacobs isn’t too sure; he reports that one company they had been constantly examining has received money from a rival financing source. “That shit-ass company got money?” May says. After attempting to reach a few clients May finally bolts from the 28th floor. He ventures out to the sidewalk, where he gets better phone reception. Soon Jacobs joins him, as do other staffers. There they stand, four abreast, yammering into their phones on the sidewalk, their new office, trying to make things happen.      Eventually the little posse gravitates across Nassau Street to Chase Manhattan Plaza. While on the phone, May eyes a planter, and within the planter, he finds an electrical outlet. His mind starts racing: I could plug in my phone and conduct business right here. With phone service nearly impossible, the partners finally tell everyone to work from home until Monday, but May makes a mental note. In a pinch, a planter at Chase Manhattan Plaza could be his office.  A giant gold-plated door plaque regally announces that you’re entering the New York headquarters of National Securities. Taped onto the lower-left corner, a small sheet of paper marked “May Davis Grp” points the way for the 20 employees who show up for the first semi-official day of work. Salaries aren’t being paid, so it’s mostly commission-based employees who come, eager to create their own cash flow.  Shortly after 10 A.M., May stands up at the end of the floor and tries to instill some order. People are milling around like third-graders on the first day of school. No one has files or computers or personal mementos or any of the things that tie you into a space. May orders everyone to pick a seat and then stay there. “No musical chairs!”   With none of the firm’s dozen or so financing deals ready to close, May wants to get the institutional sales operation running. Heading the department is Patsy Senese, a 20-year Wall Street veteran. May calls her “Ms. Bulldog,” with both respect and apprehension. She claims the chair near the only phone, although the line won’t accept incoming calls. Nonetheless, she wants to execute trades herself, on her cell if necessary.  Cell phones aren’t reliable enough, rules May. “This is not Goldman Sachs, which has several billion in assets and can afford to make a mistake,” he declares. Instead, the process will work like this: Senese will get the orders and call them down to Kevin Davis in Baltimore, who will then call a licensed floor broker to execute the trade. Davis will get the order confirmations and relay them to Senese as best he can. Meanwhile, Jacobs raises compliance issues. Although the National Securities OTC trading team is currently working from an outside office, when it comes back, May Davis will reside on the same floor as another brokerage—a no-no under conventional circumstances. Jacobs tells the staff to image an invisible wall that they can’t go through. Not too long after the market opens, an institutional client puts in a big order, for 200,000 shares of a stock currently trading at $20.50. The client doesn’t want to pay any more than that, and hopes to pay less. Senese grins widely, a toothpick dancing in her mouth, and relays the details to Davis. Davis is less enthusiastic. He hasn’t actually executed a trade since the first George Bush was president. He already hates this. Papers and order notes start filling his desk. In his booming baritone, Davis calls down to a floor broker to buy the first 100,000 at the $20.50 market price and further instructs the trader to pick up the rest “not held,” figuring he’ll cobble together a bunch of smaller trades at lower prices. “We’ve got priests, we’ve got liquor, we’ve got a spare bedroom,” Owen May told his team. “Do what you have to do, because these are strange times.”  “Not held” is a Wall Street term that means the trader isn’t limited to any specific price. His floor broker obliges, calling Davis back with the news that another 20,000 shares have been purchased—at $20.60, 10 cents higher than the client’s ceiling. Davis is furious. “You didn’t tell me it was a limit!” the broker responds. The correct terminology, Davis is informed, is “limit order.” Davis has a correction of his own: “How about if I get in the car, drive up there, and whup your ass?” While Davis curses out the trader, May tackles logistical chores, retiring to a small conference room along with Goldberg, his lawyer, and Barbara Zingalli, his hard-working assistant. It’s not in May’s nature to trust, and that goes for all the September 11 charities popping up. He wants to set up a separate scholarship for Ramos’s children. “If the kids want to go to Harvard,” he says, “why should they have to go to a state school because that’s all the damn money they have?” Goldberg suggests setting up a trust, but May turns his skepticism toward what he views as another threat—a conniving future stepfather. “There’s always some jerk trying to break into a trust,” he warns. Goldberg, meanwhile, has received a $150,000 advance from Chubb, courtesy of his independent adjuster, and in order to expedite the final claim filing, he is developing an inventory of everything the firm lost. “Some of the faxes were leased!” Goldberg says in an epiphany. “Did we own the soda machine?” Zingalli counters. “That’s right. I had $38 in quarters in my drawer,” she says, with the sigh of someone brought up never to waste. “And we just bought $121 in sodas.” She pauses, pondering the mundane. “Oh my, all my shoes and all my pictures.” She pauses again. “My $30 Metrocard. And my gold pen.” Jacobs enters the room, arguing on his cell phone with a vendor who claims that Jacobs has been logged on to an expensive stock-quote machine, “My office is blown up!” Jacobs yells. “I assure you I’m not logged on.” The conversations around him darken May’s mood. He decides to get out of the office, but the wind is blowing east from ground zero and Wall Street smells like burning tires. “I hate this shit,” he says bitterly. “I hate coming to work and watching people wearing gas masks, worried about germ warfare. Watching this, it’s like being in Israel. Then I get to work and everyone’s going, “‘There’s no phone.’” May calls up a buddy, and the two head to Barney Mac’s, a high-ceilinged bar on one of Greenwich Village’s most touristy thoroughfares. May sits there, quiet and glassy-eyed. He’s been having nightmares, one a night, like Ebenezer Scrooge. In one, he’s in his old office, looking at the Statue of Liberty, when the floor starts shaking as if in an earthquake. In another, he’s looking over New Jersey and sees mushroom clouds. In the worst one so far, he’s with Ramos in a big truck, on a winding dirt road on the side of a cliff. The truck is having trouble getting traction, so May gets out and walks around it. Just then, the cliff crumbles, taking Ramos and the car sitting next to them. May’s wife is a psychologist; she tells him he’s making progress. The bartender, Sharon, serves May a beer and comments on his sad demeanor. He solemnly explains the situation. She perks up. “I was recently let go by Merrill Lynch,” she responds. “Do you have any jobs open?” It used to take May half an hour to commute from his house across the George Washington Bridge and down the West Side Highway to his office. Now his trip takes a good 90 minutes. Sometimes he drives across the bridge and takes the A train down 200 blocks. Sometimes he takes a commuter bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and then a subway. Most often, he drives down to Weehawken, New Jersey, takes a ferry to the Wall Street area, and walks.      President Bush comes to town this morning, meeting with business leaders about a block from May Davis’s temporary home. That means, to May’s surprise, that there’s no ferry to Wall Street. So his commute consists of a drive to Weehawken, a ferry to the midtown dock, a shuttle bus to the Port Authority, and a subway downtown. Downtown, police have cordoned off 120 Broadway, and only by pleading does he get in. May Davis employees don’t have official building identification. It’s 11 A.M., two hours since he left home.  “The $64,000 question,” he bellows. “Do we have phones?” Maybe tomorrow, he’s told for the fifth straight workday. Jacobs, meanwhile, has used his cell phone and an e-mail fax account to close the first financing deal since September 11—a $350,000 infusion for the circuit-board company FIexxtech. But he’s made only minimal progress on a host of other deals.     “Just get me the revolver,” says May, surveying the scene, “and let me put myself out of my misery.”  Jacobs enters the room, arguing with a vendor who claims that he’s been logged on to an expensive stock-quote machine, “My office is blown up!” Jacobs yells. “I assure you I’m not logged on.”  May decides to step up his real estate search. When first offered, the space at 120 Broadway seemed a godsend. May even planned on staying until January 1 so he could offset any rent increase with several months of no rent. But now he sees “going back into the war zone” as his first post-September 11 mistake. Every day, his firm must literally face the disaster, when what his people most want is to move on. May has a shopping list: a downtown space, perhaps half as big as before, that’s ready to go, including furniture and maybe computers. Most of all he wants value. In a town that loves a bargain and obsesses over real estate, May is a master at both. He once surveyed 300 apartments before choosing one, and he moved his firm into the World Trade Center despite the 1993 bombing specifically because that event made it a bargain. He paid only $26 a foot for space that some assume cost triple that. May is ready to bargain-hunt again. “I have to look at 1,000 spaces in order to find the one that’s going at crackhead prices,” he says with a shrug. May has already checked out half a dozen more. The Manhattan commercial real estate market is in flux—13 million square feet of office space vanished with the attack. But as May tours the buildings around Wall Street, the market seems remarkably stable. For the most part, the spaces fall into three categories: gold-plated, with fancy addresses such as 40 Wall Street and rents to match; temporary digs that offer large rooms with working desks, phones, and computers for $5,000 a month; and dot-com bombs, complete with track lighting, Aeron chairs, and desperate subletters. (“It’s ready to go tomorrow,” says one CEO.) What seems to move May could be considered a fourth category: “Wall Street cheap,” places, such as the World Trade Center, that convey the look of a successful company but at below-market cost. Goldwasser has dropped hints that May could take over a larger space at 120 Broadway permanently. But this afternoon, May walks in to 7 Hanover Square, which is dominated by Guardian Life Insurance. A firm called Paragon Capital Management is offering most of the second floor. It’s a boring space: Formica desks, square offices, kitschy art prints. But it’s as far away from ground zero as you can get in the Wall Street area, it’s on the second floor, and it’s priced to move, at $25 a foot. “Very workable,” May mutters. Later, he brings over Mayblum and Jacobs for a reality check. The latter is resigned—a view freak, he’s the only one in the firm advocating for another high floor—but impressed. “We were so spoiled,” he sighs. “We have a beautiful space in the World Trade Center, and now we’re here in the second floor of a bullshit building.” May finishes up his day by interviewing Sharon, the trader/bartender whom he met two days ago. Their chance meeting appealed to his underdog hiring policy, and her institutional sales background fits well with May’s evolving concept of his firm. May has become increasingly hesitant to replace Ramos, and not just for emotional reasons. Ramos was a market maker, betting the firm’s money—on each trade he made. May trusted him, but he’s loath to train, much less trust, someone new, and Ramos’s young deputy isn’t ready for the job. Instead, May ponders beefing up Senese’s division, and Sharon, a Hong Kong native with Canadian roots, offers an international Rolodex. Pressed for time, May decides to multitask. May had two pieces of art in his office: Over his credenza was an Erte print, Golden Fleece, depicting a woman with ram’s horns and a cape (“It jumped out to me”), while behind his desk was a Mark Kostabi print called Upheaval, depicting people wielding plungers. Worried that insurance will give him only what he paid, without appreciation, he starts ducking into Soho galleries. Sharon has three galleries to demonstrate why she should be rescued from slinging drinks at Barney Mac’s. “Do you guys carry Ertes?” he asks the saleswoman at a gallery, adding, “Don’t get excited, I’m not going to buy anything.” While they can’t hazard a guess on Golden Fleece, they do tell May that the Kostabi he bought for $1,500 is worth $1,750. Less than pleased, May heads to a few other galleries, none of which is helpful. All the while, Sharon gives him her elevator pitch: “This is what I can bring to the table: experience, youth, energy, and contacts.” May listens and tries hard to discourage her. “This is not a real firm,” he says. “This is a very small boutique.” She says she’s looking for the collegiality of a small firm. “You’ll get scared off when you deal with Patsy,” he replies. Trying to move the discussion, Sharon asks him what he thinks of a watercolor. “Too joyful, too nice,” he says. “It needs a couple of gas masks.” A plastic grocery bag shows up. Inside is an account statement that reports that on February 22, 2000, May Davis sold 1,000 shares of Winstar. This crusty document was found in Park Slope, Brooklyn, five miles and a river away from the old offices. A do-gooder identified May Davis via the statement and, thinking it might be important, somehow tracked down the new office to return it. It’s the only hard file left from the old office. When Jacobs picks it up, a thimbleful of soot flies into the air, creating a little plume of smoke that lingers. The sense of loss is accentuated by looking across the room. The National Securities OTC trading team has returned. A dozen people now inhabit the other side of the invisible wall Jacobs conjured up. Each of their traders has access to working phones, as well as two terminals with Bloomberg and Quotron. On the May Davis side of the room, Patsy Senese controls the firm’s only phone. It now accepts incoming calls, but it no longer does outgoing long-distance. Plus, it’s an entirely different line. “They changed the num-bah on me!” she yells.  Goldwasser comes in to apologize. National Securities has only a fraction of its original lines and needs to get its own operation squared away. He promises 10 lines as soon as he can, and the National Securities staffers prove diligent about transferring calls. May again heads out to look at real estate. On Nassau Street, in front of the New York Stock Exchange, he eyes a van that’s up on a jack as two workers change a flat, a situation he finds unnerving. Soon after, he sees a helicopter hovering noisily over the World Trade Center site. His first thought: It’s going to blow up! May shakes his head. “Psychologically, I’m screwed up,” he says.     Senese, meanwhile, can’t bear the temptation. She creeps over the imaginary wall, hijacks a National Securities phone, and begins reeling off calls. Ah, a working phone! As it turns out, the National Securities traders won’t need it. That very day, Goldwasser breaks the news: 10 of them are laid off. Business was bad before September 11; now it’s atrocious. The traders don’t get emotional. Theirs is a mercenary business. “It’s par for the course,” says Jacobs. The traders file out as quickly as they marched in. The floor belongs to May Davis again.  The burden to do the right thing, both by the firm and its staff, has been straining May, and he decides he needs help, at least with business. Paychecks are still weeks away, and just 23 employees, almost all commission-based, have returned. Of the remaining 29, three have officially quit, and while the others expect to be back, they’re currently in an odd state of limbo. The firm’s expected monthly revenue will be less than half of what it was a month earlier.      So as May sits down to breakfast at the Plaza Hotel with Doug Breeden, the new dean at his business school alma mater, Duke’s Fuqua School, it’s easy to read his face: Finally, someone to tell me if I’m doing okay. He starts peppering Breeden with questions. How should he balance taking care of Ramos’s children with the fact that his firm is cash strapped? Should he use this opportunity to restructure, even if it means throwing people out of work? How does he talk candidly to his employees without further discouraging them?      Like a kind priest, Breeden provides absolution: “The best way to ensure that you can take care of the whole family is to take care of the firm,” he says soberly. Take care of the firm. That resonates. As the breakfast winds up, May feels better. It’s exactly one month after the worst day of their lives, and as if with the turn of the calendar’s page, there’s a palpable mood change on the floor at May Davis. A lot of it has to do with the phones. They’re finally working, outgoing and incoming, local and long-distance, all 10 of them. A main number and nine rollover lines that Red Jacobs confidently answers, transferring calls around the floor. “Oh, it’s to die for,” gushes Senese. Armed with phones, Senese and the firm’s head research analyst, an old-timer named Bill Laemmel, who’s partial to wearing his overcoat throughout the day, spend the early morning faxing handwritten notes to clients. The homemade stationery (copy paper, with an old business card in the corner and the firm’s new info handwritten next to it) all bears the same message: “Thank you for staying with us during these times.” As the morning goes on, the orders pour in, many occasional customers in sympathy, many regulars happy to return to some sort of normalcy. May’s feeling okay too. The previous night, he dreamed he was in an SUV with his father, flying over a gorge, Evel Knievel-style. “I’m not in Afghanistan, not in New York, not dreaming of Harry,” he says with a wistful smile. “It could be progress. It could be a major breakthrough.” May has decided to move on 7 Hanover Square. He grabs Goldberg, who will handle the negotiations, and they march over. Once there, they grill Mike, the landlord’s representative, about nitty-gritty details. A communications closet will be needed, and wiring and data jacks must be redone. In-building parking needs to be secured. “I want an à la carte list,” says May, the cagey buyer. “Why don’t you make up a wish list?” responds Mike, the eager seller. “Don’t you guys do some charity work for the victims, a couple free desks?” May says, only half-joking, pressing his advantage. Upon returning, May tells his assistant, Barbara Zingalli, that he thinks they’ve found a permanent home. “Second floor!” she cries. “That’s wonderful—I could just jump out!” Zingalli reports on all the progress she’s made, courtesy of the working phones. She’s tracked down Lehman Brothers, which had a large check ready for May Davis for several weeks but didn’t know where to send it. “We’ll come get it,” says May. She also found out that Mickey Ramos, who without any remains to mourn over has clung to hope that somehow Harry would one day walk through the door, has decided to have a funeral. (Ramos will later get a hero’s send-off in a packed Newark church, with more than 600 attendees, including the city’s mayor.) Davis, meanwhile, relieved of day-trading duty, has interviewed Sharon, the bartending investment banker. The partners agree to give her a tryout in institutional trading. But it’s still uncertain whether Ramos’s OTC group will be revived. Twenty feet away from May, Sharon’s future boss, Senese, has traded more than a million shares—a banner day, even pre-September 11. “It’s awesome,” she exclaims. “And there are a lot more people that owe us.” With May back in the office, Zingalli makes another critical phone call. She rings up the office of May’s physician, Dr. Horowitz. “How would I get a psychiatric referral?” she asks. “My boss was at One World Trade Center.” She gets a number for Aetna. Before calling, she asks what kind of psychiatrist May would like. “New York midtown, Park Avenue,” May replies.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2021/09/09/the-forgotten-story-of-911s-ultimate-underdogs/,The Forgotten Story Of 9/11’s Ultimate Underdogs
"A pair of Allen Edmonds Park Avenue oxfords, part of the official U.S. team uniform for the 43rd ... [+] Ryder Cup. When Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa and the rest of the 12-man American Ryder Cup squad slip off their soft spikes for more formal attire during the tournament’s opening ceremonies, they’ll be sporting a limited edition of Allen Edmonds’ bestselling Park Avenue cap-toe oxfords in mahogany. The Caleres owned brand’s signature dress shoes have been customized for the occasion with the Ryder Cup logo embossed on the premium calfskin insole. The limited-edition look is also be available for purchase on the Allen Edmonds website. The biennial grudge match pitting America’s best golfers in a team competition against the top players on the other side of the pond tees off at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin on September 24th just 45 minutes from the Allen Edmonds factory in Port Washington. “It was the icing on the cake to this perfect partnership. Not only are Team USA’s shoes being crafted in our factory but our team members will hand-deliver them the week of the event. It doesn’t get more personalized than that,” David Law, senior vice president and general manager at Allen Edmonds, says.  Patriotic values run deep in Allen Edmonds brand DNA. The premium shoe manufacturer and retailer began operations in 1922 and gained national traction when they became a supplier to the U.S. Army and Navy during WWII. An avid golf fan, Law’s fondest Ryder Cup memory is the 1969 tournament held at Royal Birkdale in Southport, England. The competition ended in a 16-16 draw when in a show of remarkable sportsmanship Jack Nicklaus conceded a three-foot putt to his opponent Tony Jacklin on the 18th hole. “Giving that last putt to Jacklin to halve the match, and have the first ever tied Ryder Cup, instead of making him hit it and potentially lose the tournament in front of his fans—this kind of class and sportsmanship is what made this such a memorable event between two iconic champion golfers,” Law says. A few years back Allen Edmonds was named the official on-court shoe supplier of the NBA Coaches Association which was synergistic for the upscale brand as it’s known for its extended range of sizes. Coaches are typically former players so they tend to require longer and wider footwear than off the rack offerings provide. Law also sees natural parallels in the golf space and specifically within the pomp and circumstance of the Ryder Cup. “Golf and Allen Edmonds share a culture centered on pride that comes with a passion and commitment to one’s craft and a spirit of innovation. As a pinnacle American lifestyle brand, we are proud to support such an historic event,” he says. Allen Edmonds will celebrate their 100th anniversary next year, and while they’ll likely stick to their knitting, who knows, perhaps a golf shoe could be in the works? While the pandemic has lessened the consumer appetite for the dress shoe category, the company did enjoy a spike in demand for their sportier styles. In the Fall of 2020, they launched a line of sneakers and more casual styles to capitalize on the growing opportunity in the active and casual space spurred by the work from home trend.  Casual styles represented just over 40 percent of Allen Edmonds’ sales in the recent second quarter.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikedojc/2021/09/09/allen-edmonds-deemed-the-official-dress-shoe-of-the-american-ryder-cup-team/,Allen Edmonds Deemed ‘The Official Dress Shoe’ Of The American Ryder Cup Team
"A set of 101 non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, from the ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" collection, which features images of various cartoon apes, sold for $24.4 million in an online sale at Sotheby's auction house on Thursday, wildly surpassing estimates and offering further proof that the market for NFTs is surging once again.  Sotheby's accepts payments in the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether and USDC. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a set of collectible NFTs representing 10,000 cartoon apes, each with unique arrangements of accessories (such as eye patches, necklaces, and earrings) and different colored fur. In addition to the 101 NFT's, the winner is granted the ability to generate six new Mutant Ape NFT using one of the NFTs in the collection, as the lot includes three M1 and three M2 ""Mutant serums."" According to the NFT-focused website, Decrypt.co, “If a Bored Ape is injected with an M1 or M2 serum, the resulting Mutant Ape retains traits of the original ape,” thereby increasing value of the new NFT. The final sale price of the lot greatly exceeded Sotheby's presale estimate, which the auction house set at between $12 and $18 million.  Sotheby's accepts payments in the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether and USDC, as well as fiat currency. Sotheby's sold a second lot, featuring 101 NFTs from the Bored Ape Kennel Club collection (NFTs that feature images of dogs) for $1.8 million on Thursday. Yuga Labs, a tech company based in Delaware, officially launched the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which is stored on the ethereum blockchain, on April 30th. The complete set includes ten thousand ape-based NFTs, all of which sold out in less than 24 hours after being initially offered for approximately $200 in Ethereum cryptocurrency. The secondary market price climbed past $1,000 almost immediately and had soared to nearly $72,000 per Bored Ape by early September. On Monday, a single Bored Ape was sold at 740 Ethereum, or about $2.9 million. Despite concerns this summer over the NFT marketplace when sales slumped, other NFT collections have seen their value climb recently as well. Over the weekend, CryptoPunk #6275, a computer-generated avatar of a teal-colored alien with a beard, sold for 1319 ethereum, which equates to approximately $5.2 million. Last week, Fidenza #547, an NFT from the Art Blocks collection, sold for $1.8 million. In late August, Visa, the financial services company, purchased a CryptoPunk for its corporate collection. Over a 30-day period from mid-July to mid-August, a total of $897 million in NFT sales were recorded, according to data from the NFT tracking site NonFungible. In total, NFTs have reportedly generated close to $7 billion in global sales over the first eight months of 2021.  In August, NBA superstar Stephen Curry, a former two-time MVP for the Golden State Warriors, paid $180,000 for a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT. Curry later changed his Twitter avatar to a picture of the NFT.

The beta will include several of the upcoming shooter’s 20 maps (16 multiplayer, 4 Champion Hill). These maps include the jungle island Gavutu, the icy urban Red Star, the cramped Eagle’s Nest and the twisty-turvy Hotel Royal. You can read all about these maps, which I’ve played, in my multiplayer impressions piece. I also go into detail about the gameplay and modes that you can expect during the beta. Overall, I have a lot of concerns with Vanguard at this point, but I do think it’s a fun game and definitely worth playing in beta form over the next two weekends.

"Stephen and Ayesha Curry's Eat. Learn. Play., unveiling a new mobile resource center at the East ... [+] Oakland Youth Development Center on September 08, 2021 in Oakland, California. (Photo by Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for Eat. Learn. Play.) NBA star Steph Curry and his wife, entrepreneur Ayesha Curry, descended from their colorful bus Wednesday afternoon to a small crowd of cheering children in East Oakland, California. As the Currys—who are practically royalty in the Bay Area—took pictures and signed autographs, groups of children began to line up at the side of the bus, clamoring for free books being handed out by volunteers. It’s the kind of excitement the Currys were hoping for with the Eat. Learn. Play. Bus, a mobile resource unit that will distribute hot meals, grocery staples, fresh produce and free books to underserved children in Oakland. The completely refurbished school bus is decked out with bright murals featuring the Currys, multiple flat-screen TVs, a rooftop deck, speakers and a basketball hoop. It’s a food truck, free bookstore and entertainment center all rolled into one. The idea is to reduce the stigma around receiving free resources by making the experience fun—and improve Oakland’s literacy rate. According to the nonprofit Oakland Literacy Coalition, only 35.1% of Oakland Unified School District students are reading at or above grade level.  “We wanted to make it colorful and have all the hydraulics and antics to have that feeling like when you’re a kid and the ice cream trick would come driving down the street. We wanted kids to feel that same excitement about books and food,” Ayesha Curry told Forbes. It took roughly $350,000 to renovate the old school bus, but books and food will push the cost of operating the vehicle to at least $1 million per year, Chris Helfrich, CEO of Eat. Learn. Play, the Curry’s charitable entity, told Forbes. The foundation—which accepts outside donations—will foot the bill, though Helfrich declined to say how much money the Currys have contributed to the nonprofit since they founded it in 2018. He did say that the Currys fund all of the foundation’s operating expenses, so any outside donations will go directly toward its services. With “seven-figure” donations each year, Helfrich said, the Currys are the foundation’s largest donors. Steph is the 11th highest-paid athlete in the world, according to Forbes, with earnings of $74.5 million in 2021. Though he made $34.5 million from basketball this year, Steph’s business ventures off the court have earned him even more. He has his own production company, an Under Armour 
  
  UAA 
  sportswear line and starred in Subway commercials during the Summer Olympics. He’s also an investor in bottled water company Oxigen and earlier this week, crypto exchange FTX announced that Steph will become an investor and global ambassador for the company. Steph and Ayesha’s foundation, Eat. Learn. Play., aims to deliver 100,000 books, 50,000 hot meals and more than 500,000 pounds of fresh produce to families over the next year. The Alameda County Food Bank will operate the bus on its regular route across Oakland, though exactly where it will show up is still being hammered out. The bus will also host community events, such as book readings, cooking demonstrations, youth sports clinics and health screenings, according to its website. “This has exceeded all our expectations in terms of something that’s new and unique and fun—and it’s also with something that has a purpose in terms of creating joy around literacy,” Steph Curry told Forbes. The Eat. Learn. Play. Bus is a continuation of the Currys’ growing charitable efforts in Oakland, which expanded rapidly during the pandemic. After schools shut down, Eat. Learn. Play helped start a massive food delivery program for students and their families. The foundation has so far delivered 16 million meals across the city through the program, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Steph said his family doesn’t have a concrete dollar figure for how much they want to donate to charity over their lifetime. Eventually, both he and Ayesha potentially see a fleet of these buses roving around Oakland. And after Steph retires from pro basketball, he wants to prioritize the foundation and other charity work.  “For me, it’s about approving the right programs and processes so that when I’m done playing, I’ll have the capital time to invest in terms of how we scale (the foundation) up,” he said.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/09/09/steph-and-ayesha-curry-turn-school-bus-into-free-bookstore-pantry-for-oakland-kids/,"Steph And Ayesha Curry Turn School Bus Into Free Bookstore, Pantry For Oakland Kids"
"Quentin Tarantino himself enjoying 'Tarantino Live: Fox Force Five & The Tyranny of Evil Men.' Tarantino Live: Fox Force Five & The Tyranny of Evil Men perhaps shouldn’t work, but it does. It really, really does. The musical production, the latest live experience from For The Record, is a gamble that pays off. The show staged at The Bourbon Room on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, takes the lion’s share of the films directed by Quentin Tarantino, and puts them in a narrative blender. The audience gets to drink up a potent cocktail of iconic scenes and dialogue, live performances of classic soundtrack excerpts, and characters resequenced to create a new narrative and a multipart dissertation on the filmmaker’s catalog. Constantly switching between Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, Jackie Brown, The Hateful Eight, and Jackie Brown by way of Death Proof, Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, and Django Unchained, this could have been a creative car crash, but the cast and creatives pull it off with aplomb. In fact, they succeed with such apparent ease that you wonder why someone didn’t do this sooner. Rather than a classic linear narrative, Tarantino Live takes Fox Force Five, a collective of kick-ass female characters from his films, and has the audience follow them in a new story constructed from parts of his movies. Patched together like Frankenstein’s monster, it creates a new story where they fight the Tyranny of Evil Men who inhabit Tarantino’s cinematic universe. There are also a few creative flourishes that pepper the production, including one involving Charles Manson. Tracie Thoms in 'Tarantino Live.' Tarantino Live: Fox Force Five & The Tyranny of Evil Men is staged in the 200-seat performance space formerly occupied by Rock of Ages. The action takes place both on the formal stage as well as around and amongst the audience, who are kept fed and watered by a team of servers. This is R-rated elevated dinner theatre with attitude as seasoned performers, including Death Proof’s Traci Thoms, belt out banging Tarantunes, and they utilize every inch of space available to them. The show’s pace is relentless and, as the action is taking place all over the room, there are times when you feel like your head is spinning trying to take it all in. It is, at times, bewildering, but that is part of its power. The staging is an impressively innovative feast with a mix of highly effective lighting and sound design, solid physical theatre, and some applause-inducing video design. The atmosphere, right from the get-go, makes you feel like you’re being strapped in and taken on an exhilarating roller coaster ride through the mind of a master. The interval is a chance for a bathroom break but, more importantly, for the audience, who are asked to remain masked when not eating or drinking, to catch their breath and discuss what the hell they just experienced.  Acting like the pillars of this temple to Tarantino, the show is punctuated with narration (courtesy of Wilkie Ferguson as Clarence the bandleader), explaining things, bridging narrative gaps, or sometimes just placing pieces in context in this reimagining of the filmmaker’s artistic vision.     Janel Parrish (left) and Lindsey Gort (right) recreate a scene from 'Kill Bill' in 'Tarantino Live.' Having been an evolving project for the last decade, Tarantino Live is not an entirely new show, although this production is its most complete form and has been reworked to incorporate Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood and to play most effectively in its current home. This is also not the first time For The Record has sipped from the pop culture fountain and gargled with its contents. In the last few years, the team has previously used this postmodern cabaret experience to tackle everything from 80s teen movies with the superb The Brat Pack to the films of Martin Scorsese in Scorsese: American Crime Requiem. Their Love Actually Live show was a box office-record-breaking hit and returns to The Wallis in Beverly Hills later this year. Suppose you know his movies and those Tarantino’s classic moments that have entered the cinematic vocabulary, but nothing more. In that case, this is a great way to drink up his work and have a thoroughly entertaining night out. If you love musical theatre, but you’re not all that familiar with Tarantino’s work, you’ll appreciate the performances and the staging. If you are a Tarantino purist, you will never have seen his work presented in this way, but you should. He’s even seen it and given it his seal of approval. Tarantino Live: Fox Force Five & The Tyranny of Evil Men runs every Thursday through Sunday until the end of September 2021. Tickets start at $49, with food and drink not included, but honestly, it is worth every cent.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2021/09/09/tarantino-live-is-an-immersive-theatrical-experience-that-will-blow-you-away/,‘Tarantino Live’ Is An Immersive Theatrical Experience That Will Blow You Away

"The federal government’s tally of nursing home deaths from Covid-19 omits thousands who died before a clear policy for reporting the numbers was put in place last year, according to a study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Researchers estimate over 16,000 more nursing home residents died from Covid-19 than what the ... [+] federal government has recognized.  The study from a Harvard researcher and her team estimated the federal government’s count is missing 12% of cases and 14% of deaths that occurred among nursing home residents in 2020.  This amounts to 16,623 deaths that were omitted nationwide, suggesting more than 118,300 nursing home residents died from Covid-19 last year, or about 30% of all virus-linked deaths.  The discrepancy with the official tally is because the federal government did not require nursing homes to report cases and deaths from Covid-19 until the end of May, three months after the first reported outbreak at a nursing home in Washington.  It was then up to states to retroactively report the cases and deaths from that period to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the researchers said.  They produced a national estimate through looking at the states with fuller reporting of cases and deaths prior to May 2020 and then using an algorithm to calculate the numbers across the country.  “To our knowledge, no previous study has used the available data sources in combination with the federal data to estimate national nursing home Covid-19 cases and deaths,” the study’s authors wrote. “This study aims to fill that gap.”  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on nursing home residents, who are more susceptible to severe illness from the virus. However, cases and deaths in these facilities have decreased drastically since the widespread distribution of vaccines. Some 83% of nursing home residents are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to federal data, while that number is about 62% among staff. New York has gained particular attention for its troubles with nursing home death data, which became one of the scandals that led to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s political downfall. A January report from the New York State Attorney General’s office found his administration had undercounted nursing home deaths by as much as 50% by using a narrower definition of Covid-related deaths than other states that included only those who died in nursing homes (not those transferred to hospitals).  “New York Gov.

"In his newest world record-breaking stunt, Robbie Maddison does a quadruple backflip on his Razor ... [+] dirt bike from 5,000 feet in the air  What drives a daredevil to keep pushing himself, attempting higher, longer, faster, more extreme feats? It’s a question Aussie Robbie Maddison, 40, has been pondering during a transitional period in his career—one that has seen him nab numerous world records, including breaking his own for longest motorcycle jump, traveling 350.98 feet on his bike in 2008. But for his latest, jaw-dropping feat, Maddison took some inspiration (and a challenge) from his young sons, Kruz and Jagger.  In a new video from Razor that just debuted today, Maddison and his sons tool around a dirt course, father doing a backflip to impress his boys. But Kruz and Jagger aren’t impressed by merely one backflip. They motion for him to try two—no, three—no, four. They want to see a quadruple backflip.  Then, Maddison looks to the sky, and his newest, gravity-defying stunt is born.  Maddison has set his newest world record not on dirt—nor water, a popular place for him lately with his modified water bike—but in the air. With a helicopter hoisting a steel ramp he designed and built 5,000 feet in the air, Maddison rides his bike down the ramp and into a freefall, completing a quadruple backflip before he kills the bike and deploys his parachute.  It’s a stunt you just have to see for yourself: “It’s my greatest stunt,” Maddison told me. “I’m super proud of it. There was a different element, having my kids involved and showing them you’re able to achieve things if you go about them the right way.” Maddison made his name in the world of freestyle motocross, competing in multiple X Games. He took gold at X Games 2004 in Australia's Wonderland after completing 13 backflips and won silver in 2010 for best trick.  He won multiple other FMX events around the world and soon turned his focus to stunt performing, setting two world records in May 2005 with the Crusty Demons motorcycle stunt group, traveling 221 feet on a 125 cc bike and 246 feet with a Superman seat grab on a 250 cc bike. His aforementioned 2008 record of 350.98 feet still stands—though plenty are taking a shot at it.  In recent years, however, in the interest of his health and preventing head injuries, Maddison has pulled back from FMX and focused more on water-based stunts, as well as pilot training and skydiving. “I’ve been dead five times,” Maddison says. “In 2015, I had a traumatic head injury and died on the front yard of the house in front of the kids, traumatizing the whole family. I dealt with a lot of depression after that. I had to get my mojo back. Skydiving really saved my life. It gave me the same exhilaration I got from motorcycles, but skydiving seems kind of safer than freestyle motocross.” Make no mistake; “motorcycles are always going to be my life,” Maddison says. But he’s not trying to go out every day and do crazy things just for the sake of saying he did them. He’s selecting his projects and preparing for them carefully; he’ll be stunt doubling for Jason Statham in the new The Expendables film after doing the same for Daniel Craig in 2012’s Skyfall and for Vin Diesel in XXX: Return of Xander Cage (in that case, riding a dirtbike on the ocean).  Razor knew that it wanted to work with Maddison on a project, but it deferred to him as the mastermind to develop it.  “We couldn’t have dreamed this up ourselves; Robbie came up with this tremendous idea and the next thing you know, he was building a ramp and testing it in his backyard,” said Alexis Trevino, RAZOR USA’s senior director of global marketing. “He’s a daredevil in the purest form, but he’s also really careful and got the right team and he really thought about this and planned it all out. It wasn’t just, ‘We’re gonna jump out of a helicopter now;’ it was months of planning.”  All the preparation paid off; the entire jump was filmed in just one take, resulting in the destruction of only one Razor bike. Prior to actually taking the bike up, Maddison got reps jumping out of the plane and out of a hot air balloon and doing backflips without it. He also hung the ramp above his foam pit and practiced doing a backflip into it—and promptly tore his calf muscle.  “The ramp was too steep,” Maddison explained. He needed to remove the last three feet; the length of the ramp was generating too much g-force. Maddison never practiced riding the bike off the modified ramp from that height, but he went through all the other steps in the process and perfected it before going up in the helicopter. On the day of the stunt, however, there was one anxiety-inducing surprise.  As you can see in the video, to get the shot of Maddison launching off the ramp, prior to then following him in the air, skydiver and award-winning sky filmer Sean McCormack climbed onto the underside of the ramp—unstrapped. McCormack’s weight tilted the ramp on an angle. “He was like, ‘Go! Go!’ and I was like, ‘I can’t! It’s on an angle!’” Maddison recalled. Trying to ride down the ramp at an angle would have prevented him from being able to do the backflips at best and been disastrous at worst.  Maddison shifted to the left, McCormack moved to the right, and as Maddison took off down the ramp, McCormack let go, straightening the ramp just in time.  “That was the only thing that happened in the moment at 5,000 feet,” Maddison recalled with a chuckle.  After all, Maddison says, it’s not just about the stunt, performed in a vacuum; the filming crew and production are what bring it to life. “Capturing it and the editing was just as important as the performance,” Maddison said.  So, back to the original source of motivation: were the Maddison boys impressed with their dad’s jaw-dropping quadruple backflip in the sky? “They’re proud of Dad regardless,” Maddison said. “Where I’m getting pushed my them is to be the best father I can be. Being a father is the biggest challenge I’ve ever faced as far as being consistent and being accountable, and ultimately your kids get to the level of how much you put into them.”  For Razor, working with Maddison was a no-brainer; having the rest of the Maddison clan involved was what really took the project into another stratosphere.  “We really wanted to show Robbie in his pure form, but also the human side of Robbie, him in his own element, being a family man, a really inspiring person with tons of records and just a fantastic human being overall,” Trevino said. “Showing him and his family was a showcase to do these epic things. We all have a little bit of epic within us; you need a support system and people encouraging you to do great.” As for what’s next? Maddison isn’t ready to share specifics, but “you can bet your bottom dollar plans are in place,” he said. “I’m very excited for the future.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2021/09/09/daredevil-robbie-maddison-flips-out-of-helicopter-with-record-breaking-stunt-on-razor-dirt-bike/,Daredevil Robbie Maddison Flips Out Of Helicopter With Record-Breaking Stunt On Razor Dirt Bike
"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member, in her newly-launched primary challenge against Rep.

Liz Cheney (R-WY), one of two Republican Members of the House select ... [+] committee investigating the deadly pro-Trump invasion of the U.S. Capitol meet in a room ahead of the first hearing in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, July 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. During its first hearing, the committee - which currently made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - will hear testimony from law enforcement officers about their experiences while defending the Capitol on January 6. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Trump, in a statement, blasted Cheney, one of his most ardent Republican critics in Congress, as “disloyal” and said she is “the Democrats [sic] number one provider of sound bites,” likely referring to Cheney’s many public denunciations of him. Hageman’s bid, filed with the Federal Elections Commission just an hour before Trump put out his statement, appears built around the ex-president’s backing, often a decisive factor in GOP primaries where fealty to him tends to be a necessary ingredient for success. Trump lauded Hageman as a “fourth-generation daughter of Wyoming, a very successful attorney,” and claimed she has the support of Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who has not yet issued a public endorsement. Hageman, who placed third in the 2018 GOP primary for Wyoming governor, enters an already crowded primary field that includes State Sen. Anthony Bouchard, State Rep. Chuck Gray and former House candidate Darin Smith. Cheney responded to Trump’s criticism on social media within minutes, tweeting a photo of his statement with the caption, “Here’s a sound bite for you: Bring it.” Forbes has reached out to Lummis’ office for comment. Trump has endorsed challengers to five of the 11 Republicans up for reelection in 2022 who voted for his impeachment or conviction for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol: Cheney, Reps. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) and Fred Upton (R-Mich.), and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). “It is tragic that some in this race have sacrificed... principles, and their duty to the people of Wyoming, out of fear and in favor of loyalty to a former president who deliberately misled the American people about the 2020 election, provoked an attack on the U.S. Capitol, and failed to perform his duties as president as the violence ensued,” Cheney said in a statement. “This is a ""hot"" race with some very interesting candidates running against her. Remember though, in the end we just want ONE CANDIDATE running against Cheney,” Trump said in July, announcing plans to meet with some of the candidates at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. 77%. That’s the share of Wyoming Republican primary voters who said they won’t vote for Cheney’s reelection in a July poll from McLaughlin & Associates, Trump’s former pollster. The survey also found that Cheney narrowly prevails in a six-person race, with 23% of the vote to 17% for Gray and Bouchard and 7% for Smith. As is the case with many in Wyoming’s political elite, Hageman was once a staunch Cheney ally. She donated $500 to Cheney’s unsuccessful Senate bid in 2014 and $1,500 to her victorious House bid in 2016. She was also an adviser to Cheney’s Senate campaign, according to Politico and the Washington Examiner.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/09/trump-endorses-new-primary-challenger-to-disloyal-gop-rep-liz-cheney/,Trump Endorses New Primary Challenger To ‘Disloyal’ GOP Rep.

"COACHELLA, CA - APRIL 17: Kanye West performs on stage during the third day of Coachella Valley ... [+] Music Festival on April 17, 2011 in Coachella, United States. (Photo by Wendy Redfern/Redferns) Whenever Kanye West has a new album to share with the world, it’s bound to be a massive success, no matter what genre label it fits under. A few years ago, the rapper’s music took a creative turn into religious territory, and he quickly found himself dominating Billboard’s various Christian and gospel rankings, which came as a surprise to many fans. Now, as his latest collection arrives on a number of tallies, the musician tops his own previous best showing, proving that even though he may be relatively new to this field, he is only competing with himself at this point. West’s new album Donda launches at No. 1 on this week’s Billboard 200, Billboard’s all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed releases in the U.S., with the largest debut of 2021. The set, named after his late mother Donda West, starts with 309,000 equivalent units, easily enough to put it in first place. That impressive sum also ensures the project kicks off its time on both the Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts at No. 1 as well. In fact, according to Billboard, Donda is the first release to debut atop both of those tallies of the most successful religious music in America with more than 300,000 units shifted, at least since the rankings began using the current methodology, which combines pure sales with streaming and track sale equivalents. West’s latest now holds the record for the biggest start on either tally, with the hip-hop titan grabbing that title from...himself. Before this week, the record for the largest debut on both the Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts also belonged to West. His first entry on the two lists, 2019’s Jesus Is King, easily conquered the tallies when it arrived with 264,000 equivalent units, which was also enough to make the No. 1 album of any kind in the U.S. that frame. It’s still living inside the top 10 on both religious rankings. Donda was so successful in its first full tracking week, West also dominates the corresponding Hot Christian Songs and Hot Gospel Songs charts. The rapper controls the highest 23 spots on both rankings with tunes from the new album, occupying 92% of both lists, which feature 25 spaces.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/09/kanye-west-is-only-competing-with-himself-on-billboards-christian-chart/,Kanye West Is Only Competing With Himself On Billboard’s Christian Chart
"Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao trains during a workout session at The Venetian on November 20, 2014 in ... [+] Macau, Macau. (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images)   There’s been a ton of speculation about what’s next for Manny Pacquiao. But world’s first boxer to win titles in four different weight divisions is always looking forward.  Last month in Paradise, Nevada, Pacquiao fought Yordenis Ugás in a highly touted bout for the WBA’s super welterweight title. After 12 rounds, Pacquiao lost a unanimous decision to the 35-year-old Puerto Rican boxer.  Yet, the 42-year-old Philippine superstar can boast of an impressive 62–8–2 record over his 26-year boxing career, and one that has taken place alongside a stint in professional basketball in his home country as well as a successful run in politics, as a senator. It’s also been speculated that Pacquiao may run for president of the Philippines in 2022.  In addition to that, Pacquiao is hoping to use his fame as a boxer to help the less fortunate. His Los Angeles-based charity called the Manny Pacquiao Foundation has the fight against poverty as its main initiative. Prior to last month’s big match, Pacquiao and his foundation announced partnership with Looptify, to make “PacMan” merch available to diehard fans who also want to help out a good cause. This week, Pacquiao spoke more about that partnership.  “When we first started discussions with Looptify, it was obvious they were already making some waves,” Pacquiao said, via email. “They were putting together some major partnerships, and we wanted to be a part of that.” Philippine boxing icon-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao delivering a speech at the senate in Manila on ... [+] August 8, 2016. (Photo credit should read TED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images) He adds that Looptify, a firm which describes itself as a “marketplace platform for notable celebrities, influencers, musicians (and) professional athletes” to connect with fans, is all about doing good, not just selling goods online.  “The other thing that stood out to me was their desire to give back. Looptify wanted to make sure proceeds go to the Manny Pacquiao Foundation on a regular basis.” Looptify was started by well-known funders that include Silicon Valley concerns Fusion Fund and Shima Capital, along with celebrity backers Dave Chappelle and NBA star Kyle Kuzma.  After a quick conversation about the partnership, Pacquiao also shared some perspective on his long career in boxing, how he trained for a title fight in his forties, and the similarities between boxing and politics.  Pacquiao also doesn’t hint in any way that he’s retired from the ring.        Andy Frye: You are a legend in boxing and have achieved a lot. What has motivated you to keep fighting professionally for so long?  Manny Pacquiao: I continue to fight because of my love for the sport, but also because of the support of all of my fans. There is nothing like the feeling of fighting for an entire country and all of my fans around the world.  I would not be where I am today without all of them. It also allows me to continue helping the less fortunate. Because I am so blessed, I feel a duty to help others. I’ve walked in their shoes before so I know how it feels. AF: How does training for a fight change in your forties? How do work in preparation—if it is at all different?  Pacquiao: My body does not recover as fast as it used to, but since I’ve been training for so many years, I know my body really well. I know when to listen to it and take a morning off from jogging or a day off at the gym, leading up to the fight. I also try to take really good care of my body, from rest to nutrition (in order) to help with that process. VIDEO: Career highlights versus Marquez, De La Hoya, Hatton and others. AF: You've fought and beat a lot of world class boxers. Who was the most difficult to fight? Or the most enjoyable to battle?  Pacquiao: I’ve had some amazing opponents over my career and each one posed a different style and threat.  My matchups with (Marco Antonio) Barrera, (Érik) Morales, and (Juan Manuel) Marquez were some of my favorite matchups because of the type of fights we were able to give the fans.  The fans always enjoy two guys that aren’t afraid to go toe-to-toe, and those matchups were some of the most memorable. I won some and I lost some of those, but it has been an honor to share the ring with so many great warriors. AF: Some say politics is ""like boxing"" but you would know first hand. Or is your political career more negotiation and friendship than we think? Pacquiao: Boxing can be political sometimes but just like anything else, you have to keep your head down and just keep working hard. Focus on your passion and get the job done. Politics can be messy but if your heart is right, just keep your head down and fight for the people you are called to serve. That’s my passion. Through my position and the Manny Pacquiao Foundation, we want to give people a better quality of life. AF: What advice do you have for boxing's newest generation of fighters?  Pacquiao: Work hard. Don’t try to take any shortcuts. Dedicate yourself to your craft. Stay humble no matter what success you have and enjoy it while it lasts.  Boxing provides amazing opportunities but it is not easy. I’m excited about the up-and-coming stars in our sport. ***** Read Frye’s boxing interviews with Evan Holyfield and Tammara Thibeault.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyfrye/2021/09/09/manny-pacquiao-what-is-next-and-what-boxings-taught-me/,Manny Pacquiao: What Is Next And What Boxing’s Taught Me
"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 15: Go-Go head coach Jarell Christian talks with Cameron LeFear (53) ... [+] during open tryouts for the Capital City Go-Go, the Washington Wizards' G League affiliate, at the Entertainment and Sports Arena. (Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post via Getty Images) Jarell Christian has traveled to Portland, Maine just twice — both as an opposing coach to face the Maine Red Claws, now known as the Maine Celtics. That is set to change, however, as Christian officially was named head coach of the Boston Celtics G League affiliate Thursday morning.  Christian has a clear vision for what he wants this program to look like, and it’s perfectly aligned with that of Brad Stevens. During the 2019 season, Stevens often spoke about the importance of having a G League system that reflected the parent club’s habits and best practices. If a two-way player is called up, the goal is to have it be as seamless a transition as possible. Christian, who has tremendous experience at the G League level, knows the benefits of a program with that in mind, but for the Virginia native, it all starts with quality relationships. “One thing about me is I’m a genuine person. I care about people. I’m a relationship-based person. That’s how I do my best work,” Christian said. “Forming and building positive relationships with not just the players, but the staff and everyone in the organization. The organizations that I have been fortunate enough to work with have done a great job seaming the two programs together because they had great relationships between the two. They wanted to have a kind of symmetry with one another. The coaches from the parent club would be invested with what was happening in the G League with their team and their players. They wanted to know if their players were getting better, they wanted to see film, they wanted to attend practices. It takes a village, you know?” Stevens, now the Celtics’ president of basketball operations, has expressed this to Christian, just as he has in the past when publicly speaking about the relationship between Boston and Maine. “When you have that type of environment, where NBA folks are invested just as much in the G League sometimes as much as their own team, the players feel it, the coaches feel it, the staff members feel it – it gives the program a family atmosphere, which is what Brad (Stevens) has expressed to me that he’s going for,” Christian said. “He wants it to be seamless with the two. Whether it’s exhibit 10 guys transitioning to the G League season or two-way guys going up and down or assignment guys, he wants it to be a good environment – a learning environment and a place where they can go and feel like their development is at the forefront.” Christian is no stranger to putting player development front and center — his resume speaks for itself. The Virginia native spent four years with the Oklahoma City Thunder’s G League affiliate, the Oklahoma City Blue, where he worked with the likes of Mark Daigneault, Monty Williams, Maurice “Mo” Cheeks and Adrian Griffin. In his second season (2015-16), Daigneault got called up to the Thunder staff, allowing Christian to take on interim head coaching duties for 16 games. When Daigneault, now the Thunder head coach, returned for the following two years, Christian served as his lead assistant. The experience in Oklahoma City was invaluable, according to Christian, who noted that he was able to learn from and build relationships with some brilliant basketball minds thanks to the Blue’s proximity to its parent club.  “That’s the good thing about the Thunder organization,” he said. “Even when the G League season is not in session, you’re still with the Thunder full time — you’re in practice, drills, pre-practice, summer league, draft workouts, playoff prep — all of that with the parent club, which is really good. You get to build a lot of relationships with guys you wouldn’t have normally if you were just around for a G League season. You really start to build those relationships, so that’s how I got close with Monty (Williams), Adrian Griffin and Mo Cheeks. All of those guys are close to me now because of my interactions with them during the offseason. That was special.” Christian’s time in Oklahoma City earned him a new job during the 2018-19 season when he served as the first-ever head coach of the Capital City Go-Go, the G League affiliate of the Washington Wizards. After a successful inaugural season, Scott Brooks and general manager Tommy Sheppard expressed a desire to increase Christian’s role within the organization, which ultimately moved him to the Wizards staff as an assistant for the last two seasons. From player development to defensive coordination, Christian served as a vital member of Brooks’ staff during his time in Washington. That versatility should help the Maine Celtics find success during the 2021-22 season. Equally as important, however, is Christian’s familiarity with the uniqueness of the G League. Every player and coach is fighting to make it to the next level, while simultaneously dealing with a lack of resources. It’s a lot to juggle while managing a team and heading player development, but Christian has done it before and remains well aware of the situation at hand.  “Walking into most G League situations, you have to understand the challenges that you’re going to face,” Christian said. “You’re going to face players not getting paid like NBA players or living the lifestyle of an NBA player. The facilities they’re playing in, for the most part, are not NBA facilities and the resources are not NBA resources in a lot of places. You just have to understand the challenges that you’re walking into.” Christian will work with Ime Udoka’s staff in Boston through training camp before heading up to Maine in mid-October. Alex Barlow, who previously served as Erman’s lead assistant with the Red Claws, will be the associate head coach under Christian, according to sources, creating a great duo at the top of the Maine Celtics staff. For now, however, Christian will work to get on the same page as Udoka and Stevens in Boston.  “It starts with Brad and Ime (Udoka) and all of us being on the same page. The closer I am with Ime and understanding how he wants this program to be run, the better I can mimic that up in Maine,” he added. “The thing that I always go to is that I want to be sure that the players are leaving our program better than they were when they came in. That’s just being able to provide a lifestyle for themselves or their family as a result of the work and effort that we all put into them.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisgrenham/2021/09/09/jarell-christian-ready-to-make-impact-with-boston-celtics-as-g-league-head-coach/,Jarell Christian Ready To Make Impact With Boston Celtics As G League Head Coach
"New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza (L) is congratulated by teammates (2nd, L to R) Todd Ziele, Robin ... [+] Ventura, Armando Benitez and Bobby Jones after the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 behind an eighth inning 2-run home run by Piazza 21 September, 2001 at Shea Stadium in New York City. Security was high and the signs of patriotism everywhere as the two teams played the first baseball game in New York since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center twin towers 11 September. AFP PHOTO/Matt CAMPBELL (Photo by MATT CAMPBELL / AFP) (Photo credit should read MATT CAMPBELL/AFP via Getty Images) A documentary about one of the most remarkable and universal feel-good moments in baseball history begins with a necessary reminder of why everyone took the field at Shea Stadium on September 21, 2001, filled with a terrified uncertainty. The first minute of “Remembering The Game For New York” — which airs tonight on the MLB Network and looks back at the Mets-Braves game that featured the iconic go-ahead home run by Mike Piazza — includes footage of hijacked planes flying into the Twin Towers before both buildings collapsed on September 11, 2001, when 2,977 were killed at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a plane believed to be headed to the White House or Capitol was crashed into a field. The opening narration delivered by Mark DeRosa — a New Jersey native who played that night for the Braves and is now an MLB Network host — will resonate with anyone who lived through that awful day. “I’ll never forget any of it,” DeRosa said. “Where I was, what I was thinking, what I was feeling.” More importantly, DeRosa’s words — and those of his fellow New York-area natives who were in uniform for the Mets or Braves that night — could help to convey the chaotic emotions of 9/11 to a younger generation that might not understand the trepidation with which everyone tried lurching back to the tiniest slice of normal 10 days later. “To think of 20 years past — and I know you guys know this, because we’re here, we have kids, I have kids, they don’t remember other than pictures,” said Al Leiter, a former Mets pitcher and New Jersey native who joined DeRosa, Brooklyn native John Franco and Staten Island native Jason Marquis on the MLB Network set across the river from the rebuilt One World Trade Center, also known as the Freedom Tower. For a few hours on 9/11, there seemed no limit to what might happen next. Bridges and tunnels into and out of New York City were shut down almost immediately after the attacks began. The Mets, who were in Pittsburgh to play the Pirates, were moved to a hotel in the suburbs because the hotel they were staying at downtown was next to a federal building. Franco and Marquis — the latter of whom started for the Braves and tossed six solid innings on Sept. 21 — discussed the pain of losing firefighter friends who died while fighting the blazes and of the collective grief New Yorkers felt for the employees who went to work that sunny late-summer morning and never returned. “You see pictures of people running out — these guys are putting their lives on the line to be heroes and running in the opposite direction,” Marquis said. “Feeling so sad for just the average person going to work, trying to put food on a table for their kids and the Moms and Dads and the lives that were lost,” Franco said. “It’s so sad.” Over the subsequent days, the enormity of the death toll begin to sink in with the around-the-clock sight of rescue teams searching for survivors. With baseball games postponed for the remainder of the week, players from both New York teams visited Ground Zero. Shea Stadium became a staging center and Mets players helped load boxes with supplies for rescue workers. The baseball schedule resumed Sept. 17 with the Mets in Pittsburgh — the series was originally scheduled to take place in New York — and the Yankees in Chicago to face the White Sox. As Sept. 21 loomed, the usual emotions yielded in anticipation of a Mets-Braves game — the rivalry was fierce bordering on mutually contemptuous after a six-game NLCS in 1999 and a season-long pennant race in 2000 — were replaced by a universal fear. “My thoughts were I can’t imagine even playing in this game,” said then-Braves first baseman and current Nationals manager Dave Martinez as he stood with DeRosa across from Citi Field at the site of Shea Stadium’s home plate. “You felt like you were in the safest place you could possibly be,” DeRosa said as footage of snipers near the top of Shea Stadium and video of cops frisking fans aired. “But you didn’t trust anything.” The Mets, wearing first responder hats, mingled with the Braves beforehand. Prior to first pitch, the teams stood along their respective baselines, with most players and staff members being moved to tears by the solemnity of the ceremonies, which included a 21-gun salute in a silent stadium, Diana Ross and Marc Anthony performing “God Bless America” and the National Anthem, respectively, and the NYPD bagpipers playing “Amazing Grace.” The most vivid images came at the end of the pregame program, when the Mets and Braves — led by Mets coach Dave Engle and Braves catcher Eddie Perez — exchanged hugs and handshakes. “Our rivals, a thorn in our sides, when that happened — hugging and shaking hands — that’s when you’re like, hey, this is where everybody comes together, we’re in this together,” Franco said. “Amazing sight in the center of the diamond,” said current SNY play-by-play man Gary Cohen, broadcasting the game on WFAN. “Meeting for hugs and handshakes — who would have ever thought that possible?” The teams traded runs in the fourth before Franco, who earned the win in the Mets’ first game back against the Pirates, allowed a pair of baserunners in the eighth and was charged with a run when Armando Benitez gave up a run-scoring double to Brian Jordan. In the bottom half, another New York native — Queens product Steve Karsay — took the mound for the Braves. Karsay issued a nine-pitch, one-out walk to Edgardo Alfonzo to bring up Piazza. “You could feel a little bit of a buzz,” said Karsay, who earlier in the documentary spoke to DeRosa as the two walked around his old neighborhood. Piazza, as was his custom, took the first pitch, a strike. Karsay remembers his next pitch running back across the plate as Piazza swung. “This one has a chance!” yelled Howie Rose on Fox Sports New York. “HOME RUN!” At first base, Martinez barely resisted the temptation to congratulate Piazza. “At one point, I was like ‘Go, go, go!’” Martinez said with a laugh. “And the ball goes out and you want to just jump on him. I thought, wow, this is what’s meant to be.” Benitez allowed a leadoff single to Javy Lopez in the ninth but got Keith Lockhart to hit into a game-ending double play. “It was the only game I ever played in from the time I was nine years old I didn’t mind losing,’’ DeRosa said. The concept of sports as a representation of something resembling normalcy continued taking root. By Sunday, the 41,168 fans at Shea Stadium were frustrated with the blown save by Benitez that cost the Mets a chance to pull within 2 1/2 games of the Braves. Two decades later, the most memorable Mets-Braves game of all continues to reverberate with those who experienced it…and perhaps, in the midst of far more fractured times, for those who didn’t. “I know it had a huge impact on me — it put things, life in a different perspective,” Marquis said. “I was 23 at the time, so you’re starting to still find yourself and figure things out. It was definitely the most meaningful game I played in.” “To me, that was very important to be part of that,” Franco said. “Just to see how New York came together, how the city came together, how the country came together, watching us play. Fortunate enough to pitch in that game and be a part of it. Think about it 20 years later (and) how important it was at that time to put a band-aid on a wound and seeing the fans happy just for a little while.  “That’s what stuck out with me. That made me feel so good, that we helped out in a certain way. And I’ll never forget that as long as I live.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybeach/2021/09/09/remembering-the-game-for-new-york-doc-delivers-memories-and-lessons-that-resonate-20-years-later/,Documentary On Mets’ First Home Game After 9/11 Delivers Memories And Lessons That Resonate 20 Years Later
"Cepton Vista X90 lidar sensor San Jose-based Cepton is one of the less talked about lidar vendors in the auto industry today, but as part of an SEC filing today for its plan to go public through a SPAC merger with Growth Capital Acquisition Corp., it has revealed its first major production customer. Beginning in 2023, General Motors 
  
  GM 
  is planning to start installing Cepton-based lidar sensors in as many as nine different models.  Founded in 2016, Cepton developed an early relationship with Japanese lighting supplier Koito and that company has been an investor in the startup. Like several other lidar suppliers, Cepton is licensing its technology to Koito with the more established company actually integrating that intellectual property into automotive grade sensors and supplying it to GM. Aeye, another Bay area lidar startup that went public earlier this summer has a similar deal with Continental with the German company supplying sensors to an automaker starting in 2024.  One of the first publicly known development programs to use Cepton’s lidar was Ann Arbor, Mich.-based May Mobility. May used lidars from Cepton, Leddertech and Velodyne on its first-generation automated shuttles. Its recently introduced second-generation platform is now using long-range lidar from Velodyne and short-range sensors from Ouster.  Cepton has a unique take on solid-state lidar unlike that from any other supplier. One of the key differentiating features of the various solid state solutions is the laser beam steering mechanism. The most commonly used approach is micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) which effectively uses microscopic mirrors on a chip to direct the laser pulses across the sensors field of view. Aeye, Innoviz and many others use MEMS.  Cepton uses something called micro-motion technology (MMT). The company has shared few details on MMT, but based on what it has said, the closest analog would something like quartz crystal that is used in watches and clocks. When energized with electricity, the crystal vibrates at a known frequency which is used to drive the timepiece. Similarly, MMT has something that vibrates to direct the laser pulses in a known direction. The result is claimed to be a very robust and low-cost solution for automotive lidar.  In demonstrations on the road, Cepton lidar sensors are able to get reflections from other vehicles more than 200 meters away. Unlike Luminar and Aeye which use more expensive 1550 nm lasers that are considered eye-safe, the Cepton lidar uses the lower cost 905 nm wavelength that can cause eye damage if the pulses are too powerful so they have to be limited.  Combined with the fixed scan pattern, 200 m is likely to be the upper useful limit for detection. Cepton quotes the range of its Vista P60 sensor at 200 m for a target with 30% reflectivity while the Vista X90 can detect 10% reflective targets at the same distance. For comparison, the Aeye 4Sight sensor can detect vehicles at up to 1,000 m while Argo AI’s new lidar can detect 3% reflective targets at 250 m and 10% targets at 400 m. As a result 905 nm lidars are less likely to be used for highly automated level 4 automated driving that is designed for highway speeds.  However, GM is likely to be using the Cepton lidar to both enhance ADAS capabilities for automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection and also to enable its upcoming Ultra Cruise system. GM hasn’t revealed any details about Ultra Cruise capabilities, but it is expected to be a so-called level 3 (L3) system that enables a vehicle to drive in the lane and follow other vehicles at a safe distance without the driver having to continuously supervise as they do with current hands-free L2 systems like Super Cruise.  Since the driver can look away from the road using an L3 system, increased sensing redundancy is required to ensure fail operational capability until the driver can re-engage. Other L3 systems that have been announced by Honda and Mercedes-Benz are also using lidar to augment the cameras and radar.  In the S-4 document filed with the SEC, Cepton states that the discussions with GM began in 2019 and originally included four vehicles, a number that was subsequently increased to nine including both internal combustion and electric vehicles. The GM program covers production from 2023 to 2027 although no actual production purchase orders have been issued yet. It’s possible that GM could delay or even cancel the program.  In addition to GM, Cepton has been working with Ford, supplying lidar sensors for ADAS research and development and smart cities efforts. It’s likely that Ford is also developing a follow-on to its upcoming BlueCruise hands-free system that would incorporate lidar and Cepton is likely one of several suppliers being evaluated.  Ford has also been working on smart sensor pods to install at urban intersections that utilize cameras, radar and lidar as well as cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications to alert approaching vehicles to potential hazards. Sensor pods using Cepton lidar were first tested in Saline, Mich. in fall 2020 and several have been installed in Miami since spring 2021 for testing with the Argo AI automated vehicle fleet.  In the next year or two, numerous manufacturers will start deploying lidar in production vehicles in addition to the aforementioned Honda and Mercedes-Benz. These include Volvo, Lucid, BMW, Xpeng, SAIC, Faraday Future and many others. The sensors being used will vary in capability from low-cost flash lidar to the more advanced long-range lidars from Luminar and Aeye with prices ranging from under $200 to the high hundreds of dollars, but virtually all aiming to come in under $1,000.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/general-motors-selects-cepton-to-supply-lidar-for-2023-production/,General Motors Selects Cepton To Supply Lidar For 2023 Production

"Ark Invest, the New York City investment firm founded by famed Wall Street stock-picker Cathie Wood, sold off a massive stake in Tesla on Wednesday, joining a crop of insiders in cashing out of shares this week as the stock recovers from its lackluster performance this year. Famed Wall Street money manager Cathie Wood has previously said the electric-vehicle company could ... [+] be worth more than $1 trillion. According to Ark's daily transaction reports, three of the firm's funds, includings its flagship Ark Innovation ETF, sold a combined 142,708 shares of Tesla on Wednesday, representing a stake worth about $108 million and adding to separate sales of about $166 million since late July. The newest transactions come just days after Wood touted Tesla's success and gave shares a price target of $3,000 (nearly 300% more than current levels) in an interview with Yahoo! Finance, saying the company's growing market share makes it poised to benefit from a nearly 18-fold increase in electric-vehicle sales by 2025. Though they've climbed about 6% over the last month, shares of Tesla, priced at about $757.50, are down nearly 15% from an all-time high in January. Meanwhile, Wood isn't alone among noteworthy Tesla investors selling off shares after the recent runup in prices: Three company officers, including two c-suite executives, sold about $4 million worth of stock in a series of transactions this week, according to regulatory filings. Ark and Tesla did not immediately respond to Forbes' requests for comment. Though Wood is notably bullish on Tesla, the consensus on Wall Street doesn't reflect the same lofty expectations. According to Bloomberg data, the average analyst price target for Tesla shares is $701, suggesting shares could fall 8% over the next year.  In the past, Wood has said Ark likes to trade around Tesla's outsized volatility, taking advantage of low prices to buy, and selling when she feels prices could take a hit. ""When we feel like analysts are hyperventilating about a stock—including Tesla—we naturally just take profits because we know we’re going to get another opportunity associated with controversy to buy the stock lower,” Wood said last year after a wave of selling. Despite the recent sales, Tesla still makes up nearly 11% of Ark's flagship fund, which holds about 3.1 million shares worth a staggering $2.3 billion and also owns outsized stakes in Coinbase, Zoom Video Communications and Spotify. On Wednesday, Ark also sold shares of chipmakers Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors, while picking up stock in software firm UiPath, real estate website Zillow and ecommerce companies Etsy and JD.com. Technology stocks led the market's rally last year, generating massive returns for tech-heavy investors like Ark. Starting this spring, however, accelerating economic growth and the threat of rising interest rates spurred a stock-market rotation away from growth stocks, like those in tech, to cyclical and value-leaning slices of the market that struggled during the pandemic (like energy and financials). Despite skyrocketing nearly 90% over the past year, the ARK Innovation ETF is up only 5% this year.

"Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be defending their Super Bowl title in 2021. (Photo by ... [+] Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) The 102nd NFL season kicks-off tonight with the defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers hosting the Dallas Cowboys. The game will air on NBC, Telemundo and streamed on Peacock.  The NFL continues to be a magnet for advertisers. For the 2020 regular season and postseason (excluding Super Bowl LV),  Standard Media Index (SMI) reports the NFL generated $3.3 billion in ad revenue for their television partners. Despite an overall sluggish ad economy last year and lockdowns from the pandemic, this represents a 3% increase from the previous season. For 2021 with new product categories and a stronger ad marketplace, the networks are reporting stronger ad pricing increases. 2020 Regular Season: With the NFL’s 2021 regular season upon us, the league continues to garner top advertiser revenue. According to SMI, the NFL games in 2020 generated $2.77 billion in ad dollars, a 3% increase from the 2019 regular season.  Fox with a full slate of Sunday afternoon games and Thursday Night Football accounted for 41% of all regular season ad dollars, a year-over-year increase of 5% in ad revenue. NBC, with their top-rated Sunday Night Football, accounted for 25% of all NFL ad dollars for 2020. NBC however, was the only network to register a year-over-year decline in ad revenue (-9%).  CBS, televising games on Sunday afternoons, accounted for 23% of all ad dollars and recorded the sharpest increase in ad revenue of any broadcast network from 2019 at +10%. ESPN’s Monday Night Football garnered 8% of ad dollars for the season and a slight 1% increase in revenue from 2019. The NFL Network, which televised only seven games, accounted for 2% of all revenue, the league owned cable network however, had the largest-year-over-year increase of 18%.  Post Season (excluding Super Bowl LV): SMI reports ad revenue for the higher rated post season totaled $613.7 million across three weekends in January 2021. The ad dollar amount was a slight increase from January 2020 of $602.5 million (+1.9%). The NFL had expanded the postseason to now include seven teams from each conference (instead of six). Hence, leading up to the Super Bowl LV there are now twelve postseason games compared to ten in previous years. Among networks, Fox once again led, accounting for 46% of ad dollars, followed by CBS (36%), NBC (16%) and ABC (2%).  Average Audience/CPMs: In 2020, the NFL continued to be a ratings juggernaut averaging 15.4 million viewers for all regular season games.  Although that was a 7% drop-off compared to 2019, it was triple the average audience of a regularly scheduled prime time show in the fall of 2020. In 2020, NFL games accounted for 69 of the 100 most watched television programs for the entire year. NBC’s Sunday Night Football has been the top-rated broadcast TV program in primetime for an unprecedented nine consecutive years. On Fox the late Sunday afternoon game dubbed “America’s Game of the Week” averaged 23.2 million viewers in 2020. It marks the twelfth straight year the late afternoon national game was the top-rated overall program on television.  As a result, SMI data found the CPMs for adults 18-to-49 during the NFL regular season in 2020 was $75, on par with linear broadcast prime time (excluding sports) CPM of $77. With a CPM of $92, for adults 18-to-49 advertisers paid a premium for the higher rated postseason games. 2021 Season: The biggest news of the offseason was the extension of NFL rights fees for CBS, ESPN/ABC, Fox and NBC. The four networks agreed to pay $89.5 billion over the next 11 years to continue to televise NFL games. This is a more than 75% increase from the current agreement. The contracts will take effect with the 2023 season and run through 2033. (The ESPN deal starts in 2022.) NBC, CBS and Fox will all pay around $2 billion and ESPN will pony up $2.7 billion. With the new contract Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
  Prime Video will have exclusivity for Thursday Night Football beginning with the 2022 season, replacing Fox. Amazon will pay $1 billion a year to stream 15 regular season games. Expect, the networks will be passing the increased rights fees to advertisers.  The most noticeable change for the  NFL in 2021 will be increasing the regular season to 17 games per team over an 18-week season (272 total regular season games). The NFL had been playing a 16-game schedule since 1978. With the extra week, Super Bowl LVI is scheduled for February 13, 2022, the latest date ever for the “Big Game”. The Super Bowl will air on NBC at the same time the network will be airing the Beijing Winter Olympics (February 4-20, 2022).  It’s been reported there are fewer than five ad units left for Super Bowl LVI. NBC is charging $6 million for a :30, an 18% increase from last year’s game, with a few ad rates reaching $6.5 million. Among product categories buying ads include the return of theatrical released movies and digital wallets. It’s been reported that Fox is already beginning to sell ad units for Super Bowl LVII in February 2023.  With strong ratings and a desirable target audience, the NFL and their television partners have for years had a number of familiar advertising categories including automotive, telecom, beverages, finance and many others. For the 2021 season we can expect an array of new product categories. As a result, the networks have been reporting strong ad demand for NFL games this season with pricing increases in the low double-digits, the highest in about a decade.  Sportsbooks: The product category getting the most attention is sports betting. In 2018 the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports wagering. Since then, states across the country have been voting to legalize sports betting. While the NFL was originally opposed to legalized gambling, for the 2021 season, the league will allow each network to accept six gambling ads per telecast: one during pregame, one per quarter and one at halftime. TV partners Fox, ESPN and NBC have also partnered with a sportsbook. In addition, FS1 and ESPN both televise gambling programs each day.  Front Office Sports reports, the NFL, in a first, has made marketing agreements with Caesars, DraftKings, and FanDuel. These marketers will have access to the NFL intellectual property including the use of game footage. Collectively, the deal is reportedly near $1 billion over five years. In addition, last month, the NFL has approved FOX Bet, MGM, PointsBet, and WynnBet as sportsbook operators for the 2021 season. Sportsbooks is expected to be the biggest emerging ad category for the NFL since fantasy sports (which some called another form of gambling) in 2015.   The signs for legalized gambling are pointing upward. Play USA expects nearly $12 billion will be wagered this season on NFL games (and $20 billion when college football is added) at legal sportsbooks. In addition, the American Gaming Association forecasts 45.2 million Americans will bet on the upcoming NFL season, up 36% from last year. AGA also found that 25% of NFL fans are more excited for this season than previous ones, up from 18% last year. Some industry analysts predict the ad spend for legal sportsbooks during NFL games this fall will reach $1 billion. Streaming: The new agreements between the NFL and the television partners allowed for live games to be streamed on Paramount+, ESPN+, Peacock and Tubi. Hence, streaming video will be another product category heavily promoted during the NFL games. The Fox owned Tubi, an ad supported streaming service, will be the sponsor of their post-game show, The OT.  Streaming video on NFL games can promote a number of other premier sporting events including NHL, MLB, grand slam tennis, PGA Golf, “March Madness”, soccer, UFC, WWE and the Beijing Olympics to grow subscriber counts. The network owned streaming services could also be an additional revenue source by selling different online ads. NBC said however, for 2021, Peacock will “simulstream” ads from Sunday Night Football.  Cryptocurrency: Sports Business Journal cites cryptocurrency as another emerging advertiser for NFL games (and other televised sporting events). Industry sources project ad spending for the category could total $100 million over the next 12 months. This fall Crypto.com will be running ads on Fox during NFL games along with MLB postseason and college football games and studio program College Football Extra. Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen are appearing in ads promoting FTX, a crypto exchange. It is part of a $20 million campaign that will air on NFL games throughout October. While the NFL is looking into possible marketing agreements, it has informed the 32 teams that they are, for now, prohibited from selling sponsorships to crypto trading companies or selling any non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The new product categories with NFL games, will increase demand resulting in higher ad pricing. According to a study by Bill Harvey Consulting, advertisers are flocking to live sports because of their strong return on ad spend. Bill Harvey notes, “Live sports engages viewers and makes them more attentive to advertising.” With a longer regular season, a stronger ad marketplace, the popularity of live sports and new advertisers willing to invest in NFL games, a more sizable increase in ad revenue than last year’s +3% is anticipated. This couldn’t come at a better time for the networks with the huge increase in TV rights fees right around the corner.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/09/09/the-nfl-kicks-off-the-2021-season-with-a-strong-ad-marketplace/,The NFL Kicks Off The 2021 Season With A Strong Ad Marketplace
"SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - JULY 07: ""Now Hiring"" signs are posted in front of a Home Depot store on ... [+] July 07, 2021 in San Rafael, California. As the economy continues to reopen across the U.S., job openings edged up slightly in May to a record 9.21 million as businesses struggle to keep up with growing demand for goods and services. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The August jobs report was disappointing: over 700,000 jobs were expected, but only 235,000 were created. The total number of people employed is still about five million lower than in February 2020 yet demand for workers is high—there are currently 1.3 job openings for each unemployed worker. Several factors are contributing to the slow labor market recovery, but three recent studies show that federal unemployment insurance bonuses played a role. For the last several months there’s been an ongoing debate about whether the federal unemployment insurance (UI) bonuses impacted the labor market. At the beginning of the pandemic the bonuses were $600 per week on top of state benefits. When that program expired, the bonuses were renewed under the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program, but at $300 per week.  The $300 FPUC officially ended on September 4th, though many states opted out of the federal program prior to September, including New Hampshire, Florida, Texas, and Wyoming. These states still had their state UI programs, they just didn’t provide the federal bonus. Since some states opted out of the program while others remained in, it is possible to analyze the effect the program had on the labor market by comparing labor market data across states.  A study published in July by Noah Williams at the University of Wisconsin was one of the first to do this. He used data from Homebase, a scheduling software company, to analyze the impact of the unemployment bonuses across the United States. In his sample, only 12 states had opted out early enough to have adequate data to compare to sates that remained in the program.  Using these data, he finds that over the ensuing weeks employment was 1.5% higher in the 12 states that ended the unemployment bonuses early. As he says, “This suggests that the enhanced federal benefits, which often provided more in unemployment benefits than in pre-unemployment earnings, provided a modest employment disincentive for lower wage unemployed workers.” A more recent study from Michael D. Farren and Christopher M. Kaiser at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University comes to a similar conclusion. This study is unique in that it separates the states that withdrew from the program into several groups depending on whether the states faced legal challenges upon withdrawing; simultaneously withdrew from other federal unemployment programs; or offered return-to-work bonuses. Since these events also affect the labor market, not accounting for them could obscure the effect that unemployment bonuses have on employment. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) data, Farren and Kaiser find that states that left the federal UI bonus program experienced employment growth at double the rate of states that remained in the program. This finding is consistent with the aforementioned Wisconsin study and with decades of labor market research that finds that bigger unemployment benefits are connected to longer durations of unemployment.  Finally, another recent study from Isabel Soto of the American Action Forum examines the effect the FPUC program had on unemployment claims. She finds that states that withdrew early from the FPUC program experienced a 5% reduction in continuing unemployment claims and a 14% reduction in initial unemployment claims.  Since some jobless people who never claim or quit claiming unemployment benefits may not go back to work—they may just exit the labor force and rely on other sources of income—these results don’t necessarily translate to gains in employment. But they do suggest that the unemployment bonuses encouraged people to claim unemployment benefits and remain on benefits longer, and for at least some people these benefits replaced a job. Though none of these studies is definitive, they all point in the same direction: The federal UI bonuses discouraged people from looking for work or taking a job. This is not surprising since we know incentives matter. When people can earn nearly the same, or sometimes more, from not working as they can from working, some won’t work.  While the pandemic is still discouraging some people from working for health reasons, we should see a stronger labor market recovery in the coming months now that the federal UI bonus program is officially over.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2021/09/09/unemployment-bonuses-slowed-labor-market-recovery/,Unemployment Bonuses Slowed Labor Market Recovery
"http://blogtoscano.altervista.org/cstu.jpg One of the biggest takeaways from the recent census numbers is that for the first time in census history, the number of white people shrank. American citizens who identify solely as white now make up 61.6% of the U.S. population, down 8.6% in the last 10 years.  For many retailers, these numbers simply reaffirm a trend they have been tracking and adjusting to for some time now. In the wake of the pandemic and a nationwide racial awakening, companies have committed to doing better by all stakeholders—employees, customers, investors and partners. As companies deepen the ways they integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their businesses, the social—or human element—must take center stage.    The risks of doing nothing are substantial. In today’s ‘employee market’ where labor shortages have become a dominant theme, workers can choose where they want to work in the future. And today’s employees want ethical, responsible companies. People increasingly care about workplace culture and believe their environment plays an important role in helping them thrive professionally (as reported by 77% of women and 67% of men).   Furthermore, customers are also demanding to see companies’ commitments in action. And if they don’t, they will make their voices heard by spending dollars elsewhere. When it comes to the s in ESG, it’s crucial for companies to embrace transparency. With many people spending on average 12 hours per day in front of a screen, customers can research anything they want. It’s as though each business lives in a glasshouse. With a few strokes of the keyboard, anyone can find out if an organization has unethical labor practices or unfair hiring standards. They can also prove if a retailer fails to adhere to the values that it preaches. And within minutes, customers can share such harmful information with thousands—perhaps millions—of other people. Today’s consumers shop with their values and reward companies that take these principles seriously. And evidence suggests that inclusive, diverse and environmentally sustainable companies have an even better chance of taking a share of consumer spend.  Customers want more details about the products they are buying than ever before. In the food world, the farm to fork movement has been popular for some time. Recent research proved that this will only continue: More than two-thirds (68%) of consumers agree that they are going to continue to limit food waste post-crisis.   A similar mentality is migrating into apparel and home goods as well. Consumers demand information about their clothing and bedding, including the raw materials to make them, where they were manufactured and how they were transported. Having a digitally connected supply network that leverages technologies like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and other traceability solutions is not only more cost-efficient and less wasteful, but can also communicate sustainability details directly to the customer. Such technological platforms possess the power to become a new form of marketing unto itself.  The experiences over the past 18 months have shown that we are all connected and, despite our differences, the things that make us human remain the same. Retailers can bring this level of sensitivity to how they treat their customers and there are some fantastic examples. Beauty companies such as Ulta,Sephora and even some startup brands are expanding their palettes to suit more skin shades and make commitments of support to African American and Black-owned brands.   Building a truly diverse and inclusive brand is not always easy to pull off. To support smaller brands, companies must relax that consideration for terms, minimum quantities and service-level agreements that they typically apply to larger brands. What is clear is that retailers who push their supply network to be more diverse will be able to meet the needs of our diverse population.  While these concepts are not new, companies that put more effort into their ESG in the coming years will emerge as the winners. The secret: These changes cannot just be marketing taglines. They must happen at every level.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillstandish/2021/09/09/the-human-element-people-need-to-be-front-and-center-in-retailers-esg-commitments/,The Human Element: People Need To Be Front And Center In Retailers’ ESG Commitments
"PEORIA, ARIZONA - MARCH 04: Julio Rodriguez #85 of the Seattle Mariners at bat against the Colorado ... [+] Rockies in the eighth inning during an MLB spring training game on March 04, 2021 at Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) The American League West Division best take note of the Seattle Mariners. The Mariners big league roster has shown improvement this season, but it is the quality of the prospects currently in development that has this scout thinking the Mariners can become a true MLB force. Over the past few seasons, the Mariners, led by Executive Vice President and General Manager Jerry Dipoto, have been slowly and deliberately churning the club’s roster to become consistently competitive. A major component of Seattle’s front office plan has been the selection and signing of athletic, multi-talented position players and pitchers capable of carrying the team to a brighter future.  Among the highest-regarded Mariners prospects:  Julio Rodriguez is a dynamic power hitting outfielder with a dynamic, 6-3, 180 pound frame. Still young and raw as a hitter, Rodriguez profiles to become an impactful slugger from the right side of the plate. Signed for $1.75M out of the Dominican Republic in 2017, Rodriguez has the type of profile that can become the offensive centerpiece of the franchise. Rodriguez is big and strong with the ability to find the barrel of the bat. While Rodriguez doesn’t have an exaggerated uppercut swing, he has started to get more loft on the ball, making his projection as a home run hitter realistic. Rodriguez has very good arm strength and projects to be a solid defender, probably as a right fielder. Scouting Grade: 65 Seattle Mariners' Noelvi Marte runs the bases, Monday, July 20, 2020, during a ""summer camp"" ... [+] baseball scrimmage game in Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Mariners fans will enjoy watching Noelvi Marte progress in the team’s farm system. He is a power hitting shortstop with speed, which is a valued combination of tools.  Athletic and versatile, it remains to be seen where Marte will play at the big league level. Signed as an international free agent in 2018 from the Dominican Republic, the Mariners gave Marte a signing bonus of $1.55M. Marte is enjoying a very solid season, hitting 17 home runs and driving in 71 runs in addition to stealing 23 bases so far. He has recently been promoted to Class-A Advanced. He’s having the type of year that puts a player on the team’s radar. Scouting Grade: 60 The Mariners liked Emerson Hancock enough to make him the No. 6 overall selection in the 2020 draft. Chosen from the University of Georgia, Hancock signed for $5.7M. If one follows the money, it seems sure that Hancock will get every opportunity to make it to the big leagues. Hancock is big and strong at 6-4, 213 pounds. Pitching at Class A-Advanced and Double-A this season, Hancock has logged 44.2 innings in 12 starts. In July, Hancock was sidelined with a shoulder injury. So far, it does not seem there is structural damage to the shoulder, but an injury to any part of the shoulder, forearm or elbow is always a concern. He returned to action after rest, and is working his way back to his normal pitching form. At full strength and at full health, Hancock throws a much better than average fastball that can reach 99 miles per hour. He can keep hitters off balance with a changeup that is almost equal in quality to his grade 65 fastball. He also throws a better than average curve and slider. His complete repertoire bodes well for Hancock as a solid rotation starter.  The Mariners have adjusted some of his mechanics, and he is making progress. It would seem that once wrinkles are ironed out in his delivery, Hancock could pitch as high as a No. 2 starter in the rotation. Scouting Grade: 60 The Mariners selected George Kirby in the 1st round of the 2019 draft. He went to Elon University and signed for a bonus of $3,242,900 as the No. 20 overall pick. While Kirby might not have a repertoire with as many high quality pitches as Hancock, he clearly has the type of arsenal that can navigate a lineup with enough deception to be highly effective. He throws his fastball in the low-90’s, with a good slider, curveball and changeup to support his fastball. Kirby has superb control, and that may be the factor that separates him from other starters. He projects to pitch in the middle of the rotation. On a similar path as Hancock, Kirby has pitched at both Class-A Advanced and Double-A this season. Pitching very well, Kirby has logged 57 innings in 13 starts.  Scouting Grade: 55 Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh makes the catch on a pop out by the Tampa Bay Rays during a ... [+] baseball game Monday, Aug. 2, 2021, in St. Petersburg, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) Cal Raleigh was selected in the 3rd round of the 2018 draft out of Florida State University. He signed above the slot for $854,000. This scout saw Raleigh play against the Arizona Diamondbacks in early August, as Raleigh was promoted to the parent club following only 872 minor league plate appearances.  Playing at two classifications in 2019, Raleigh hit 29 home runs and drove in 82 runs. With that type of power as a catcher, the team likely found little reason to keep him away from the big league team. However, to this scout, he may have benefited from additional development time. A switch-hitter, Raleigh has struggled to hit high velocity pitching at times. He does make contact, but big league breaking balls may cause him some heartburn. Raleigh appears to have good enough defensive skills to be the top future catcher for Seattle. Scouting Grade: 55 55= Better than average regular player or pitcher 60= Occasional All Star skills with several quality tools or pitches 65= Frequent All Star with an ability to consistently impact a game The Seattle Mariners organization is loaded with talent at every position. Some of the better prospects have graduated to the big leagues.

"Warzone's new map is bright and colorful. Warzone, the free-to-play Call Of Duty Battle Royale, is finally getting a new map. Better yet, we now have a glimpse of what it’s going to look like. The new Warzone map is set in the South Pacific during World War 2. As with the past two Call Of Duty entries, Warzone will be woven together with upcoming Call Of Duty: Vanguard, with an intertwining story that goes on throughout each season and shared guns, Battle Pass and Operators. Since Vanguard is set during WWII, this will be our first major Battle Royale that takes place during that war. Raven and Sledgehammer could have chosen to create a map set in any of the theaters of war Vanguard tackles—Western or Eastern European fronts, North Africa or the South Pacific—but I’m glad they went with something lush and tropical. In the brief footage we were shown of the new map, you can see just how much more colorful the new Warzone map is than Verdansk. Skip to the 25:40 mark in the below trailer for a glimpse at Warzone Pacific: The new map will roll out “shortly after” Call of Duty: Vanguard when that game launches on November 5th. I expect Season 1 won’t start right at launch, so we’ll get a couple weeks before Season 1 and the new map drop. Warzone will also launch a new anti-cheat system alongside the Pacific map which will hopefully go a long ways toward shutting down the myriad cheaters plaguing the game.

"President Joe Biden on Thursday withdrew the nomination of David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a victory for gun groups and Republicans who staunchly opposed his nomination, and a loss for Biden, who has now pulled two major nominations.  WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 26: David Chipman, nominee for Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, ... [+] Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, May 26, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Biden said in a statement Chipman would have been “exemplary” in the role and accused Republicans of using gun violence “as a political talking point instead of taking serious steps to address it,” adding that he know the confirmation process “wouldn’t be easy.” Chipman, who, following 25 years as an ATF agent, became a vocal advocate for gun control measures, failed to garner support from Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), as well as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.), all moderates from rural states. Chipman also came under intense scrutiny from Republicans, most recently with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, probing allegations of “racially biased behavior” and reports he was investigated by the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. GOP senators celebrated the move: Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said in a statement he is “glad to see President Biden has withdrawn his nomination,” and Grassley argued Chipman lacked the “fitness to lead the agency.” Gun control activist Fred Guttenberg, the father of one of the victims of the 2018 Parkland shooting, tweeted that he is “truly upset” by the development, calling King “weak” and alleging the White House “failed to put up a fight on this.” Forbes has reached out to the White House for comment. “We know it from his record as an anti-gun extremist. And we know it from the reputation he’s earned among ATF veterans as a, quote, ‘activist’ and ‘a rabid partisan,’” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a June floor speech opposing Chipman’s nomination. 2. That’s the number of major nominations withdrawn by the Biden administration.

"Due in part to the widespread distribution of Covid-19 booster shots to wealthy nations, Africa, which has seen just 3% of the continent's population has been inoculated, will receive 25% fewer vaccine doses than expected by the end of the year, the World Health Organization's Africa regional director said Thursday. People queue to register for the Covid-19 vaccine at Oltepesi Dispensary in Kajiado, Kenya, on ... [+] September 9, 2021. Responding to Wednesday's announcement that the United Nations-backed COVAX program has again been forced to reduce its delivery projections, Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's Africa Director, said the goal of vaccinating 10% of people in Africa by the end of September is no longer a realistic target.  Moeti called for ""wealthy countries with vaccine supplies that are well beyond their population's needs"" to distribute doses more equitably. She noted that the vaccination rate in sub-Saharan Africa is just 1.7% and stated, ""if companies and countries prioritize vaccine equity, this pandemic would be over quickly.""  Moeti pointed out that although COVAX has delivered more than five million vaccine doses to Africa in the past week, ""three times as many doses have been thrown away in the United States alone"" over the past six months.  Encouragingly, WHO Africa announced Thursday that weekly Covid-19 cases in the continent fell by more than 20% last week, marking the sharpest seven-day decline in two months. Yet, Moeti noted although cases have ""declined appreciably, the downward trend is frustratingly slow due to the lingering effects of the more infectious delta variant."" According to the WHO, the delta variant was detected in over 70% of samples from Botswana, Malawi, and South Africa, and in over 90% from Zimbabwe. ""To ultimately tip the scales against this pandemic, our best efforts to reduce transmission through public health measures must be met by a significant step-up in vaccine supplies,"" Moeti declared. In August, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a two-month halt on countries offering booster shots, but stated Wednesday he had seen ""little change in the global situation since then."" Up to this point, only 15% of the 1 billion vaccine doses wealthy nations pledged to re-distribute to low and middle-income countries through COVAX have been delivered. Consequently, the WHO is requesting countries wait until 2022 to start offering third doses to healthy individuals who have already received two jabs. ""We don't want any more promises,"" Tedros said, ""We just want the vaccines."" In addition to missing the target of vaccinating 10% of Africans by the end of September, the goal of vaccinating 40% by the end of the year now seems out of reach as well. In order for the continent to reach its ultimate goal of a 60% to 70% vaccination rate, Africa would need at least 1.6 billion doses, according to Africa’s CDC. They have received 145.4 million thus far. ""The problem we have with the third doses is: we have not seen enough science behind them,"" said John Nkengasong, the director of Africa's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Without that, we are gambling ... It is really still confusing to me why we are moving toward a vast recommendation for third doses."" 7.9 million.

"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 10: BTS backstage during the 61st Annual GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center ... [+] on February 10, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for The Recording Academy) Following the release of a particularly exciting remix of their single “Butter” with rapper Megan Thee Stallion, BTS’s smash climbs on this week’s Billboard Global 200 chart, a ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The tune returns to the top 10 and rises to No. 3, and Stallion is now credited on the cut as well, giving her another placement inside the highest tier on the tally. While many fans are focused on the newfound success of “Butter,” another BTS single makes history further down on the chart as the ranking turns one. BTS’s “Dynamite” falls from No. 34 to No. 47 as it celebrates its first full year on the Billboard Global 200. The tune is one of a relatively large number that have managed to appear on the ranking every week it’s been published, as the company debuted the new list, alongside one that looks at which titles performed the best around the world (but excluding the U.S.), last September. The smash is the only release by a South Korean musical act to rack up 52 frames on the roster. “Dynamite” was the second-ever No. 1 hit on the Billboard Global 200, and it rose to the summit on the third-ever chart. The tune replaced Cardi B and Stallion’s “WAP,” which introduced the ranking to the world as the debut leader. The catchy pop cut is now one of five leaders from the South Korean vocal act, as they have also reached the peak with fellow singles “Life Goes On,” “Butter,” ""Permission to Dance"" and ""Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)"" alongside Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo. BTS’s smash racked up four nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, and it is currently tied with Mariah Carey’s ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" as the fifth-longest running champion on the tally. It is presently behind Olivia Rodrigo’s “Drivers License” (eight weeks), the same singer’s “Good 4 U” and The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s “Stay” (six weeks each) and Lil Nas X’s “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” (five weeks). “Dynamite” is one of 30 songs that have now spent 52 weeks on the Billboard Global 200, and it is joined in this impressive showing by fellow inescapable earworms like The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights,” Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect,” Harry Styles’ “Watermelon Sugar” and Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now,” among others.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/09/btss-dynamite-makes-history-on-billboards-global-chart-as-it-turns-one-year-old/,BTS’s ‘Dynamite’ Makes History On Billboard’s Global Chart As It Turns One Year Old
"Officials in Michigan and the city of Detroit have asked far-right attorneys including Sidney Powell and Lin Wood to pay more than $200,000 in attorneys fees for their post-election lawsuit alleging fraud in the state, potentially the first in a series of high-dollar payments Powell may have to make for her election fraud claims. Attorney Sidney Powell leaves a federal court in Washington, D.C., on June 24. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson filed a motion Wednesday night requesting the conservative attorneys pay $21,964.75 in legal fees to reimburse the state’s costs in defending themselves against the litigation. The city of Detroit then filed a motion requesting a combined $182,192 in attorneys fees for the private law firm hired to defend the city in the case, including $116,116 that was just spent on the motion to sanction the right-wing attorneys. U.S. District Judge Linda Parker has already awarded attorneys fees to Michigan and Detroit and ordered they must be paid, but will now decide whether to grant the requests for those specific amounts. The payments are part of Parker’s broader order approving sanctions against Powell, Wood and the other attorneys that brought the lawsuit, which unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the state’s presidential election through fraud allegations that Parker ruled were false claims based on “speculation, conjecture, and unwarranted suspicion.” In addition to the attorneys fees, Parker has also ordered the lawyers undergo 12 hours of legal education on pleading standards and election law, and said every attorney will be referred to the disciplinary boards where they’re licensed “for investigation and possible suspension or disbarment.” The court did not award attorneys fees for the third defendant that filed a motion for sanctions in the case, Michigan voter Robert Davis. The Michigan attorneys fees could be just the first Powell and her co-counsel will be asked to pay, as Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has also filed a motion for sanctions and attorneys fees over the lawsuit Powell brought in that state alleging widespread fraud. Evers has asked the court to force plaintiffs and their counsel to pay $106,780 in attorneys fees, noting in a recent court filing that the decision in Michigan bolsters the state’s request. “Judge Parker’s rationale applies here just as incontrovertibly as it did in [the Michigan case],” Evers’ attorneys wrote. Powell is also facing defamation lawsuits from voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic for her election fraud claims involving their machines. The Dominion lawsuit—which the court has allowed to move forward—is asking for $1.3 billion in damages and the Smartmatic suit, which also targets Rudy Giuliani, Fox News and several of its anchors, asks for $2.7 billion. “Despite the haze of confusion, commotion, and chaos counsel intentionally attempted to create by filing this lawsuit, one thing is perfectly clear: Plaintiffs’ attorneys have scorned their oath, flouted the rules, and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary along the way,” Parker wrote in her ruling awarding sanctions, which she said the court was “duty-bound” to grant. Powell and Wood have not backed down from their fraud claims and have defended themselves against the Michigan lawsuit, which Powell has stood behind while Wood told the court he was not involved at all with the proceedings and should not be sanctioned for it. Powell said during the sanctions hearing she and her co-counsel “have practiced law with the highest standards” and the attorneys representing the defendants who brought the sanctions motion are “themselves the ones who have abused the process for political gamesmanship.”  The Michigan and Wisconsin lawsuits were two of four battleground state lawsuits Powell and her co-counsel filed in the aftermath of the election, a legal strategy Powell dubbed “releas[ing] the Kraken” after the 1981 film The Clash of the Titans. Every one of their lawsuits failed at both the lower courts and U.S. Supreme Court, however, with Parker saying in her initial ruling striking the Michigan lawsuit down that the case was based on “nothing but speculation and conjecture.” In addition to the legal fees they’re now being asked to pay, the State Bar of Texas will hold a hearing in November as part of a process to determine whether Powell should be punished—and potentially disbarred—for her post-election lawsuits, and Wood is under investigation by the State Bar of Georgia.

"On the heels of the biggest cutoff to federal unemployment benefits in history, jobless claims fell to their lowest levels during the pandemic last week, a promising sign for the broader economy as the labor market's recovery weakens amid the recent delta variant-sparked surge in Covid-19 cases.   The promising jobless claims figure comes after the worst monthly jobs report since January.  About 310,000 people filed initial jobless claims in the week ending September 4, down 35,000 from the previous week and the lowest level since March 14, 2020, according to the weekly data released Thursday. Economists were expecting about 335,000 new claims last week, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, roughly 11.9 million Americans were still receiving some form of jobless benefit, down about 255,000 from one week prior and significantly lower than the 30.4 million continued claims filed in the comparable week last summer. ""With another significant move lower, new jobless claims have reached a fresh pandemic era low, seemingly on the verge of finally pushing below the 300,000 level,"" Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, wrote in a Thursday note, also pointing out claims surged by more than 300% in Louisiana, to roughly 9,000, after Hurricane Ida. ""The coming weeks will produce some noisy data challenging interpretation and understanding, as impacts of Ida, the end of federal pandemic unemployment benefits, the still raging Covid pandemic and supply constraints muddle the picture while posing headwinds for the economy."" 5.2%. That was the unemployment rate in August, according to the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report, down from 5.4% in July. The labor market posted its worst monthly showing since January last month, adding back only 235,000 jobs despite forecasts calling for nearly 1 million additions, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department. “The delta variant of Covid-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement last week, echoing other experts concerned the pandemic’s resurgence has started to curtail the economic recovery. There are still 8.4 million unemployed people in the United States, markedly higher than 4 million in February 2020.  An estimated 7.5 million Americans stopped receiving jobless benefits entirely as a result of the federal government's pandemic-era unemployment relief expiring on Monday, according to Bank of America, while another 3 million people saw their unemployment checks cut by $300 a week—marking the largest cutoff of U.S. unemployment benefits in history.

"The U.S. Navy is developing an uncrewed, solar-powered aircraft known as Skydweller that is designed to remain airborne for 90 days at a stretch. It was revealed Thursday that the drone will be equipped with state-of-the-art analytics from Palantir Technologies to rapidly process the vast amounts of data it collects literally on the fly. The aircraft, being developed by U.S.-Spanish company Skydweller Aero, will be provide the capability to persistently watch wide expanses of oceans as never before. The idea of an ‘eternal aircraft’ that uses sun power by day and batteries by night has been around for more than 20 years. NASA’s giant HELIOS prototype flew to over 90,000 feet in 2001, but, like most subsequent solar aircraft, it was comparatively fragile and broke up in flight in 2007. This fragility has been a running problem in solar aircraft development and has repeatedly led to programs being delayed or cancelled, notably Google’s Solara 50, which crashed in 2015, and Facebook’s Aquila, which suffered the same fate 2016. However, Skydweller comes from more robust and proven stock, as it is based on the crewed Solar Impulse 2 aircraft, which flew around the world in stages in 2016. The current Skydweller prototype is the Solar Impulse 2 airframe, which has been modified for uncrewed operation. The solar-powered drone will fly missions of up to 90 days without landing “Solar Impulse spent over a decade developing an airworthy design sufficient for a human pilot and flight over densely populated areas to successfully complete their mission,” Skydweller Aero CEO Robert Miller told me. “We purchased the IP, processes, information, test articles, and a design legacy of over 1,250 flight hours, including a successful circumnavigation.” Because the Solar Impulse team worked to the safety standard of manned aircraft, and because they had to deal with the weight of a human being — whereas solar aircraft like the Zephyr only carry a few pounds of payload – they had to build it far stronger. “Skydweller aircraft is significantly more robust, flown around the world at the same middle altitudes where previous solar-powered aircraft have failed due to problems with aeroelasticity,” says Miller. The crucial difference between the current model and the original Solar Impulse 2 is, of course, that it is uncrewed. That removes the limitations that come with having a human who can only stay airborne for a few days at a time in a cramped capsule. It also frees up a lot of capacity.  “When we remove the cockpit, we are enabling true persistence and providing the opportunity to install up to about 400 kilograms [880 pounds] of payload capacity,” says Miller. The Navy is developing Skydweller under its Autonomous Maritime Patrol Aircraft program. This will carry sensors, communications and electronic warfare equipment on missions lasting for up to 90 days. “This technological leap will allow a single Skydweller aircraft to more effectively perform the mission of numerous manned & unmanned ISR [intelligence. Surveillance and reconnaissance] /configurable assets, eliminate risk to human pilots, and provide a level of persistence not available anywhere else in the military inventory, or the world,” according to a recent budget document. Currently the U.S. Navy operates the giant MQ-4C Triton drone for long-range surveillance missions. This has a bigger wingspan than a 737 airliner, and a conventional turbofan engine giving an endurance of 30 hours, impressive by the standards of crewed aircraft but not compared to the 90 days that Skydweller offers. The Triton is also extremely expensive at over $240 million each. The new solar aircraft are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the cost – but they will also be much smarter in terms of onboard brains. Skydweller Aero announced Thursday that it’s teaming with Palantir Technologies, a publicly traded U.S. company specializing in big data analytics. Skydweller will use Palantir’s Foundry platform to handle and fuse complex data collected by its sensors. “By using Palantir Foundry, we will be able to quickly analyze - and get the most value – out of the large amounts of data we'll be processing,” says Miller. Palantir technology, credited with helping find Osama bin Laden, has a formidable reputation in the defense intelligence sector. Palantir was called 'Silicon Valley's most secretive unicorn' and credited with giving the military 'a god's-eye view of Afghanistan.' The company's ability to make sense of the rising tide of big data has seen it go from strength to strength — though it has yet to turn a profit. Skydweller will carry day and night imaging cameras, plus imaging radar and other sensors. The Foundry software will help make sense of the data, not just by helping identify objects.  For example, the companies say that rather than relaying video back to operators so they can try to figure out if a black rectangle showing against the water is a ship, it can fuse the data from multiple sensors to confirm and provide details that cannot be picked out by radar or video alone. This might, for example, not just confirm that there is a ship, but that there is high confidence the vessel is a Chinese Type 052D destroyer at a specific location moving SSE at 23 knots. Having this type of analysis on board should provide actionable intelligence faster. It also avoids the bandwidth limitation that causes so many problems for other intelligence-gathering drones. Satellite communications can only carry so much information, and while other drones might store data for analysis when they land, anything collected is liable to be out-of-date after a three-month mission.  Pre-processing also means that the aircraft only needs to pass back a small quantity of relevant data, rather than endless high-resolution video of empty sea. A small team of operators and analysts will be able to handle a large fleet of drones.  The current U.S. Navy contract covers development and demonstration of the aircraft’s abilities to carry out extended missions and operate autonomously. If successful, we may see large numbers of solar aircraft carrying out persistent surveillance with worldwide reach – and not just over the oceans.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/09/09/us-navys-solar-drone-will-fly-90-day-missions-seeing-all-with-palantir-technology/,U.S. Navy’s Solar Drone Will Fly 90-Day Missions Seeing All With Palantir Technology

Trump supporters gathered in the nation's capital today to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump in the 2020 election. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) As for members of Congress who supported those attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Wallace said there were some who he has chosen not to have on his show since January 6. “There were plenty of people who were the leaders in Congress of challenging (the election) that I have not had on the show ever since then, and have purposely not had on the show because I don’t, frankly, want to hear their crap.” Wallace added that there were “some leaders” that he did bring onto Fox News Sunday because the news of the day required asking them tough questions. “But I won’t let them come on without putting them through the ringer.” Wallace’s new book, Countdown Bin Laden, tells the story of the massive American effort to find and kill Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. Wallace interviewed key figures in the fight, from the White House to the Navy SEAL team that raided the terrorist leader’s compound in what the SEALs thought would be a “one way” trip—they did not expect to come home alive.

"Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in 'The Matrix: Resurrections' I’ve long argued that a symbol of the film industry (and now, frankly streaming industry as well) was that the environment was such that studios would rather reboot or revamp The Matrix than make “the next Matrix.” To be fair, much of that can be blamed on audiences, which have flocked to a depressing degree to the familiar, the comforting and the once-was-popular. As good as this new teaser for Lana Wachowski’s The Matrix: Resurrections looks, and it looks flat-out spectacular, there is still something a little depressing in its skewed “legacy sequel but not” structure.  We again meet an unknowing and unaware Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) as he encounters visions and events that lead him to discover the truth about the Matrix in all its dystopian glory. He again meets a snappily-dressed Black man (this time not Laurence Fishburne but Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who promises to reveal the truth while arguing that he knows our protagonist better than he knows himself. We again see a leather-clad female ass-kicker (Jessica Henwick) flipping and kicking amid the neo-noir darkness.  The use of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit” is an obvious musical choice, but it’s a damn effective one. It provides a percussive rumbling by which to cut the film’s blockbuster action and spectacle, with the rising beats playing perfectly in tune with the trailer’s “action climax.” Still, as compelling and “big” as this looks, I still can’t hide my mild depression at watching what looks to be The Matrix getting a Force Awakens-style legacy sequel.   Whereas the first Matrix was meant to inspire curiosity and awe, this new teaser, by default, aims for comfort and familiarity. Films like The Bourne Identity, The Hunger Games, The Matrix and Shrek once broke huge because they were unique and different, often standing in sharp contrast to conventional Hollywood product from a given genre. Now audiences crave the familiar because it’s familiar.  We get a gorgeous sci-fi reality (from one of the directors of Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas, natch) and a “Neo rediscovers that he’s Neo” plot that seems trying to have its cake (being a new Matrix movie with younger action heroes) and eat it too (keeping Reeves as the protagonist). While the marketing (which at least hints at being a meta-commentary on needless franchise continuations) is not the movie, that does flirt with danger.  Michael B. Jordan, not Sylvester Stallone, was the star of Creed. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were the primary heroes of The Force Awakens, with Harrison Ford lending support and Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill lending mere cameos. Jurassic World featured just a few scenes with a single returning character (BD Wong’s Dr. Wu) but otherwise focused on Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt in a 20-years-later continuation. Conversely, Independence Day: Resurgence kept its prior franchise stars (namely Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman) front and center while failing to let the newbies (Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe and Jessie Usher) take true center stage. Likewise, Terminator: Dark Fate still essentially “starred” Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger while newbies Natalia Reyes and Mackenzie Davis were second-bananas. To be fair, not every brand can pull a Force Awakens and mostly hide the original stars for the sake of marketing the new heroes.  It’s clear that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jessica Henwick and Priyanka Chopra Jonas will get their moments in the sun and may even end up being the new protagonists. However, this trailer is trying to sell a Matrix for a new day while still highlighting the older heroes, as if The Force Awakens made sure to let you know that Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford were still the stars of the story.  Granted, Keanu Reeves is more popular in 2021 than Arnold Schwarzenegger was in 2019. 47 Ronin saw Reeves getting star billing but playing a supporting role to Hiroyuki Sanada. Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus isn’t even in this one. To be fair, The Force Awakens made $2.068 billion with almost no Luke Skywalker.  Anyway, so far so good, with the mere hope that the final film will be visually mind-blowing and philosophical enriching enough to overcome my aversion to (most but not all) legacy sequels. It looks absolutely gorgeous, and if it hits it big it’ll just be that easier for John Wick: Chapter 4 (still slated, for now, for May 27, 2022 alongside Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick) to break out a bit more outside of North America. But that’s a rabbit hole for another day. The Matrix: Resurrections opens December 22 in theaters (red pill) and HBO Max (blue pill). Do I care about another Matrix? Not really, but I’ll be there for a for Wachowski-directed and Reeves-starring sci-fi action movie no matter the context.   ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/09/matrix-4-resurrections-trailer-keanu-reeves-wachowski-star-wars-terminator-jurassic/,Keanu Reeves And Carrie-Anne Moss Reunite In First ‘Matrix: Resurrections’ Trailer
"FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020 file photo, Detroit Tigers pitcher Casey Mize throws to a ... [+] Minnesota Twins batter during the first inning of a baseball game in Minneapolis. AJ Hinch's success as Detroit's manager may ultimately hinge on the performance of a few highly regarded prospects. Detroit has five of the game's top 25 prospects, according to MLB Pipeline. Right-hander Casey Mize, the top pick in the 2018 draft, made his big league debut last year and went 0-3 with a 6.99 ERA in seven starts.(AP Photo/Jim Mone, File) The Detroit Tigers have had runs in 2021 where they seem to be vastly superior to more recent iterations. They have also had runs where they have looked eerily similar to the teams of recent past. However, one thing remains true; they are finally moving in the right direction. With the recent promotion of Sam Menzin and Jay Sartori to Assistant General Manager and Vice President positions, it seems that the Tigers’ front office has achieved self awareness.  They are starting to see that their old ways of doing things is not going to attract talent, wins, or fans. It also seems that if they want to continue to move in a positive direction and maintain forward momentum through their tenuous rebuild, there are going to have to be wholesale changes.  It is widely speculated that new manager A.J. Hinch is beginning to have more influence over player personnel decisions off the field, but the biggest indicator that the times are changing in Detroit, is the recent promotions of the previously mentioned executives, and the interim title of Director of Player Development bestowed upon Kenny Graham.  Reading between the lines, it does not seem like Kenny Graham is a serious internal candidate for the Director of Player Development role. Which makes sense, if the Tigers are moving in a new direction it seems that anyone in any role prior to the A.J. Hinch era is liable to be on the chopping block.  One thing for sure about the A.J. Hinch era, is that his appointment of Chris Fetter as pitching coach has been a revelation for the Tigers’ young pitching staff. The Tigers’ starters have improved a lot under Fetter. Obviously, getting Casey Mize and Tarik Skubal some experience during the 2020 season helped lay a baseline for both pitchers. Both Skubal and Mize have already become leaders of a young staff.  The chart above shows the improvement the starting staff has made in virtually every area over the past season.  The other important thing to note, is that fWAR is significantly tied to innings pitched. Therefore, the starting staff in 2020 was not even doing the bare minimum required to be even a below average pitching staff. This year the staff has given them some length which is significant because it makes them a more valuable unit, but it also keeps their terrible bullpen out of the game. Their bullpen is bottom five in those same categories with the exception of innings pitched. The next step forward will be reworking the bullpen and determining which of their young arms will be rotation mainstays or bullpen specialists. However, the Tigers are off to a good start considering how far down they have been in recent years.  The other issue is the Tigers are going to need some offensive reinforcements. There has been some progress as the Tigers’ offense has improved from being the fifth worst offense in 2020 to only the eighth worst offense in 2021. Much of that is because they really struggle to hit at home. However, playing in the cavernous Comerica Park will suppress even the best offenses. That fact is magnified by the fact they are the 16th best road offense (or 14th worst) and they are the third worst home offense in the Major Leagues. The Detroit Tigers’ rebuild is finally starting to take shape and their youth movement on the field is not being reflected in their front office as well. As top offensive prospects continue to develop in the Minor Leagues, it will be interested to see how the Tigers go about spending their money this offseason. Will they go all in on a big name? Probably not, but if history tells us anything, they will at least pretend that they tried.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesposner/2021/09/09/the-detroit-tigers-starting-staff-is-starting-to-show-value/,The Detroit Tigers’ Starting Staff Is Starting To Show Value
"Runner Parker Stinson in the new Saucony Endorphin Pro+ racing shoe that will release for a limited ... [+] time.  Runner Parker Stinson enjoys setting records. Whether personal bests or the United States record in the 25-kilometer distance, Stinson has been doing his record-setting in Saucony for the past six years. He's signed on for an additional four years, thanks, in part, to the excitement he and other elite runners have in the upcoming limited-edition Saucony Endorphin Pro+ racing shoe, the latest iteration of the lightweight propulsion Endorphin running line.  ""When they sent me the prototype for the Pro+, I texted the product people asking 'what did you guys do, what is the magic here?'"" says Stinson. ""From the first workout I did, I couldn't believe the split I was running. You can't crush every workout, but if I wasn't running faster than normal, I was running easier.""  While wearing the prototype of the Endorphin Pro+, Stinson set a 10k personal record at the Falmouth Road Race in August and also recently set a PR in a half marathon. And he's had a hand in the creation of the shoe along the way.  The new upper on the Endorphin Pro+ brings lightweight stability to a racing shoe for Saucony. Set for release Sept. 28 following a special 10-kilomenter race under the lights on Sept. 22 at the UNESCO World Heritage size Zollverein in Germany, once one of the world's largest coal mines, the limited-edition Endorphin Pro+ builds off the success of the Endorphin line, first launched in April 2020, and now featuring the Pro, Speed and Shift silhouettes.  With each silhouette engineered for elite athletes but applicable to everyday runners, the Pro offers the latest in racing technology, the Speed puts runners on the front of their toes and the Shift, a trainer-style runner, gives athletes a break from their toes. ""If you want an arsenal of shoes, they offer something different and you get the benefit of all three,"" says Anne Cavassa, Saucony president. ""These shoes were built and engineered by elite athletes.""  The Endrophin Pro+ represents the fastest iteration, using the brand's propulsive Speedroll technology with an S-curve carbon fiber plate combined with the brand's PWRRUN PB cushioning. But it was the spike-like upper that took on a new form in the latest version, one that will be created in limited quantities and not restocked after it sells out.  The Saucony Endorphin Pro+ limited-edition running shoe.  ""From heel to toe, we have examined each piece of the product to see where we can lose weight without sacrificing the integrity, construction or fit,"" says Jessie Peterson, product line manager at Saucony. ""We looked at mesh, laces, tongue construction, logo execution, stroble, carving out .01 ounces here and .01 ounces there. This product sits at 6.9 ounces for a men's size nine [a women's size 8 is 5.9 ounces] and is our lightest carbon-plated racing shoe ever."" Petersen says the Saucony approach to carbon plates increases running economy due to the proprietary stiffness and geometry. Combining the curved plate with the proper foam helps create a ""pop or springy feel,"" she says.  Stinson was part of the testing before the original Endorphin Pro launched and says the value of a carbon plate directly corresponds to how the plate and foam interact. He says the Endorphin Pro line finds that ideal interaction, but he still wanted to focus on a faster upper. The Saucony Endorphin Pro+ running shoe.  ""You'd think you just put the lightest upper on there, but we tried that a few times and it didn't hold your foot in the right way and I felt like you lost some of that Speedroll propulsion and the energy return wasn't as good,"" Stinson says. ""They found the right upper that hits that balance between extremely light and feeling like a track spike and getting energy return. I do think there is something special about the way your foot is sitting in there, making it more efficient and that is an exciting thing to say.""  ""The little, tiny changes are game-changing (for elite runners),"" Cavassa says. A self-described harsh critic—sometimes he feels bad for the feedback he texts the product team—Stinson uses both feel and data to analyze shoe technology. During the Endorphin franchise testing he upped the data collecting while taking notes on his impressions and found the shoes he felt best in were the same ones he performed best in.  The Saucony Endorphin Pro+ running shoe joins a family of Endorphin silhouettes.  Along with the performance, Stinson appreciates the aesthetics of the line. ""I think the shoe looks so cool,"" he says. ""Every time I wear the all-white Endorphin Pros peoples DM me asking when they are going to release them. There is something about how it looks contributing to how good it feels. And I love the huge graffiti Saucony logo on it. I feel fast; I look fast.""  ""I feel like Saucony is ahead of the game or on the same playing field with this shoe,"" he says. ""I feel it is an advantage going into the Boston Marathon with this shoe. That is a good feeling, since you don’t want to be worrying about your shoes in a race.""  The UNESCO World Heritage size Zollverein in Germany, once one of the world's largest mines, will ... [+] host a Sept. 22 event where runners can race in the new Saucony Endorphin Pro+. The Endorphin focus on fast, light propulsion started in April 2020 and Saucony has enjoyed immense success throughout 2021—as have most running brands—from a wide swath of products. Saucony grew 59% in quarter one and 129% in quarter two. Currently in 122 countries, Cavassa says the brand sees constant double- and triple-digit growth across the same styles and the Endorphin collection is ""absolutely on fire."" The lead road and trail shoes for Saucony—styles include the Triumph, Guide, Ride and Kinvara on the road and the trail-focused Peregrine—are all performing well.  The Germany Zollverein event will not only showcase the Endorphin Pro+ but help bring communities of elite and community runners together in a special under-the-lights experience available to watch via livestream. Using Wavelight's technology, the 1.2-kilometer lap will include differing colors of light pacing the runners across multiple speeds. Each runner will wear a wristband to help reflect color.  ""We want to create an environment to hit your own PR,"" Cavassa says, ""and bring both elite and community runners together to celebrate the shoe and the sport in an environment that is really unique and as innovative as the shoe itself.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2021/09/09/saucony-goes-high-tech-with-launch-of-limited-edition-endorphin-pro-racing-shoe/,Saucony Goes High-Tech With Launch Of Limited-Edition Endorphin Pro+ Racing Shoe
"The Circle This week, Netflix debuted The Circle season 3, not all that long after season 2 aired, but these are filmed close together and Netflix is determined to crank out these kinds of reality shows quickly now. But unlike say, Too Hot To Handle, I actually like The Circle and its weirdly basic concept of isolated people yelling at TV screens as they try to outfox each other on social media. Unlike other Netflix shows, the competition-based nature of The Circle means that they are airing the episodes in batches, then ultimately, the finale, so everyone can watch at the same time. This week, we got our first four, and have seen two people sent home, and two new players arrive already. So, out of the remaining players, who is emerging as an early frontrunner to win the whole thing? As ever, players who are there first seem to have distinct advantages over those who come later, given the alliances that are already forged, a problem with the competition Netflix has yet to address in any meaningful capacity. Both winners of the last two seasons were “OG” players who were there at the start, and it didn’t seem like any newcomer really had a chance.  In terms of this list, here’s who I see as the strongest players: 1. Kai – She has already emerged as sort of the leader of the group, and yet has done so without picking fights directly with anyone. At least not in a way that can be traced back to her (she anonymously called out Danny, but no one suspects it was her, and he’s not a very strong player to begin with). She seems to be in a commanding position with double influencer status, but with solid enough relationships where no one actively seems like they’re trying to take her down, even if they should. The Circle 2. Ruksana – Ruksana did not establish herself as a player with many strong alliances over the first few episodes, but managed to emerge as an influencer despite staying out of the “flirt” game entirely, and just being a good listener. She is a solid teammate to Calvin and Danny now, and probably has a good bond with Kai after their dual influencer session where they were on the same page as everyone. She is also playing herself, and her reveal where she informed everyone she was a little person was fantastic, and she won all sorts of “authenticity” points among everyone for that. It is effectively impossible for anyone to believe she’s a catfish now. 3. Ashley (Played by Matt) – Ashley has not ranked particularly high, and yet I think she’s sliding under the radar as a potentially strong long term player. Matt is flirting with Nick as Ashley, but also bonded with newcomer Isabella (played by Sophia). If Nick simply gets a “girl chat” going more often with say, Kai and Ruskana, I can see how she could be safe with enough alliances there. 4. Calvin – Calvin has a big target on his back and is often accused of being “fake” when it comes to these anonymous trashing sessions, but he has a number of alliances that are keeping him safe. Kai and Ruksana didn’t even consider him going out, he’s “bro friends” with Nick, he’s pretty safe at this point, even if he dropped in the rankings. The Circle 5. Nick – Nick seems like the type of player on the verge of going out, as he got very unlucky with Kai and Ruksana both being influencers, because he has no connection to either of them. That said, if he can get Calvin, Ashley or Isabella in the influencer slots, or become one himself, I can see him sticking around until the finale.  6. Isabella (Played by Sophia) – Sophia is very good at playing her attractive, straight older sister and if any newcomer has a chance of making it far, I think it’s her. The problem is that A) anyone who comes in late is at a disadvantage, as I’ve said and B) hot people who appear “too perfect” in their photo are always considered suspects to be catfish, and this game is always determine to ferret out catfish even though it like, shouldn’t really matter. 7. Jackson (Played by Rachel) – Another attractive, catfish newcomer, so double disadvantage there too. I feel like Rachel has the potential to get tripped up by not sounding enough like a guy at some point, as I don’t think she can play this part as well as DeLeesa did last season to win playing her husband. And Jackson seems to be a “double” to Nick as straight flirty white guy, but Nick has been there since day one and has more alliances. The Circle 8. Danny – Danny may be a day one player, but I agree with Kai, he’s not a strong one. He has few true alliances and does not seem all that interesting in forming connections outside a very small group. I may be wrong, but he seems like someone who is going to go out pretty soon if the new players continue to make strong impressions. And we’ve already lost Michelle, who was outfoxed by a catfish version of herself in probably the funniest thing I’ve seen The Circle do to date. But now we know we also just lost fake Michelle, and lost the sisters Ava and Chanel Capra twice, who I assume will not get a third chance. Michelle wasn’t popular to begin with, so I don’t think they had much of a chance after replacing a player who already wasn’t very highly ranked. Why would you pick the last place person to clone, given that chance? I don’t get it. In any case, it’s been an entertaining season in this first batch of episodes, though the show still has some issues to sort through with its formatting here in season 3.

"Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Corbin Burnes reacts after striking out San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey ... [+] to end the sixth inning of a baseball game in San Francisco, Monday, Aug. 30, 2021. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The Milwaukee Brewers have been one of baseball’s best teams all season, thanks in large part to the excellence of their starting rotation. While Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta have shone brightly for large stretches of the year, Corbin Burnes has emerged as the clear ace. Burnes has been overpowering, to say the least, striking out 196 batters in only 144 innings. He ranks 3rd in the NL in the former category, despite ranking only 19th in the latter through Tuesday’s games. If you dig a little deeper into this pitching line, you’ll find another area in which he’s performing just as well - contact management.  The first inkling you get is the puny number “5” in his home runs allowed column. All of the 18 NL pitchers with more innings pitched have yielded 14 or more. It goes even deeper than that, however. Contact management is real. Each year, I measure performance in this area for all ERA qualifiers in both leagues. The recipient of my annual Contact Manager of the Year hardware is the pitcher in each league who posts the lowest Adjusted Contact Score. In other words, based on the exit speed and launch angle of all batted balls allowed, the hurlers who “should have” yielded the least damage on balls in play. Earlier this week, we took a look at the state of this race in the American League. Today’s it’s the National League’s turn. The NL boasts a much stronger group of high-end contact managers than the AL in 2021. All of the five players highlighted below - with the possible exception of Burnes - either already has or almost certainly will reach the 162-inning qualification threshold. In the AL, it’s actually possible that none of the current contact management leaders will do so.  Two pitchers just missed the list below - German Marquez of the Rockies and Sandy Alcantara of the Marlins, who just might have sneaked on if last night’s start was included. (All stats are through Tuesday night’s games.) 85 Adjusted Contact Score If we were measuring contact management performance independent of exit speed and launch angle - instead measuring simply the results of all balls in play - Buehler would be the NL leader with a 67 UNadjusted Contact Score. He’s had good fortune on all batted ball types, posting 59 vs. 79, 82 vs. 102 and 70 vs. 93 Unadjusted vs. Adjusted Fly Ball, Line Drive and Ground Ball Contact Scores. His biggest strength has been his ability to induce fly balls in the “can of corn” zone. Buehler has yielded 50 90-99 mph fly balls thus far, comfortably more than anyone else on this list, and that 79 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score does rank 5th among NL qualifiers. His average launch angle (11.0 degrees) is the only one in double digits among this group.  84.2 Adjusted Contact Score Had to go to decimal points to break the tie for 3rd between a pair of Reds’ starters. Castillo has been way better than his mainstream numbers this year, as he has been hurt by his home park and team defense. His actual, Unadjusted Contact Score is an uninspiring 104. Castillo is a ground ball machine, currently posting the highest grounder rate and the lowest average launch angle allowed (3.8 degrees) among qualifying NL starters. He’s the antithesis of Buehler - he’s been UNlucky on all batted balls types, posting 113 vs. 82, 94 vs. 84 and 128 vs. 106 Unadjusted vs. Adjusted Fly Ball, Line Drive and Ground Ball Contact Scores. That 84 Adjusted Liner Contact Score is the best among NL ERA qualifiers.  84.1 Adjusted Contact Score Solid contact management skills turn the other pitchers on this list from good to potentially great starting pitchers. Miley needs to excel at contact management to merely survive, as he lacks the stuff to miss bats regularly. He’s excelled in this regard for years now, peaking in 2019 when he earned AL Contact Manager of the Year honors as an Astro. It’s all about grounder volume and authority suppression for Miley. His grounder rate is nearly a full standard deviation above league average, and his average grounder authority allowed of 80.5 mph ranks 2nd among qualifiers. His overall average authority allowed of 84.5 mph also ranks 2nd.  77 Adjusted Contact Score And now for the two pitchers with a legitimate chance to emerge as 2021 NL Contact Manager of the Year. They are also, I would submit, the two most deserving NL Cy Young Award candidates at present. What isn’t there to like about 2020’s NL Contact Manager of the Year? He’s a rare hurler who regularly gets outs at the top and bottom of the zone. His grounder rate is almost a full standard deviation above league average, and he also generates pop ups at a higher than league average rate. He smothers authority across all batted ball types, posting 75, 86 and 87 Adjusted Fly Ball, Line Drive and Grounder Contact Scores. The first two of those marks rank 4th and 2nd in the NL, while his overall average authority allowed of 83.7 mph is easily the best.  71 Adjusted Contact Score Now back to Mr. Burnes. He’s a stealth ground ball generator, with a grounder rate close to Wheeler’s, though he’s allowed significantly harder authority on the ground than his Philly counterpart. He’s absolutely suffocating fly ball authority - his 49 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score is easily the best among qualifiers in either league. He’s allowed only those five homers, and just nine flies hit at 100 mph or higher. That pales in comparison to the 43 90-99 mph flies he’s allowed, that do a fraction of the damage of 100+ mph ones. His overall average authority allowed of 85.0 mph trails only Wheeler and Miley among NL qualifiers. Long-term, it’s going to be more difficult for Burnes to repeat his 2021 contact management feats than it will be for Wheeler, but for this one year, Burnes is the favorite to take home the trophy.  Next week, we’ll update the Cy Young races in both leagues. Does the AL race extend beyond Gerrit Cole and perhaps Lance Lynn? Can anyone compete with Burnes’ and Wheeler’s respective quality and quantity edges in the NL? We shall see.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyblengino/2021/09/09/excellence-of-brewers-ace-corbin-burnes-extends-well-beyond-strikeouts/,Excellence Of Brewers Ace Corbin Burnes Extends Well Beyond Strikeouts
"Turnstile Band members left to right: Daniel Fang (Drums), Pat McCrory (Guitar), Franz Lyons ... [+] (Bass/Vocals), Brady Ebert (Guitar), and Brendan Yates (Vocals). 2021 has undoubtedly been a monumental year for the Baltimore hardcore outfit, Turnstile. Not only did they surprise everyone with their brilliant summer EP-short-film, Turnstile Love Connection, but more recently they’ve released their finest album to date, Glow On. If their 2018 record Time & Space gave any hints, it was that Turnstile had the potential to go beyond their primary influences of hardcore and heavy music. With Glow On they not only manage to do so, but they reaffirm the idea that there’s still creativity and experimentation left to be had in the genre of rock as a whole. Infectious latin grooves, funky rhythm breaks, rapid fire hardcore riffs, and dreamy ambient leads are all some of the various ingredients that fuel this powerhouse album. However, Turnstile’s ability to craft such a diverse listening experience all while staying true to their upbeat hardcore energy, is what makes Glow On such a profound 2021 release, more over a monumental hardcore record.  Of the album’s many stellar attributes, one of the key features to Glow On’s success is its approachability. Turnstile’s roots being hardcore don’t exactly play to their benefit, specifically in making them ‘easy listening’ for a broad audience. However, they pay respects to their roots with the song format and the structure of Glow On, more so than with the musical substance showcased — the band isn’t churning out simple meat & potatoes hardcore songs, but rather some of the catchiest and stylistically intuitive hardcore songs yet. It’s safe to say that an average rock listener and an avid hardcore fan can both find aspects to cherish from this album. And while it’s still more inline with the hardcore genre, Glow On’s consistency when it comes to delivering hooks and amalgamative hardcore tracks is a feat that has yet to be met. That being said, it’s hard to list off the album’s standout tracks as nearly every track pulls its weight proportionally. “Holiday,” “Fly Again,” and “DANCE-OFF,” flourish in their simple mid-tempo riffs, and each build up to their own pulsating chorus. “Underwater BOI,” “New Heart Design,” “Alien Love Call,” exude the dreamy lo-fi elements of Glow On, and make for some of the band’s most forward thinking tracks yet. And then there’s tracks like “T.L.C.,” “DON’T PLAY,” and “LONELY DEZIRES,” which all hit the ground running with typical fast tempo punk grooves, but later take a sharp turn of their own; “DON’T PLAY’s” early transition into a latin-esc groove is one of most satisfying surprises on the record. From the album’s tight and clearcut production, to the plethora of styles woven into Turnstile’s already unique hardcore sound, Glow On is easily the band’s most ambitious work yet. And if it was a question of if they meet their own ambitions, the answer would be a resounding yes. Turnstile accomplish what they set out to do on this record, and then some. By doing so, Glow On has propelled Turnstile as one of the best and most important hardcore band’s of this generation. Furthermore, Glow On is a rare instance of a hardcore record that seemingly pushes the boundaries of rock music, therefore making it an instant classic of the modern era.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/quentinsinger/2021/09/09/review-turnstiles-glow-on-is-a-hardcore-album-for-the-ages/,Review: Turnstile’s ‘Glow On’ Is A Hardcore Album For The Ages

Almost exactly half of all his new Hot 100 wins appear in one of the most important regions, helping him make history with a slew of new hits. 23 of the 27 songs featured on Donda debut on the Hot 100 this week, with an even dozen landing inside the top 40, the area that typically defines when a popular song becomes an actual “hit,” at least by traditional thinking.  With 12 new top 40 hits now included in his discography, West advances on the list of the musicians who have scored the most such smashes in history, and he jumps over two of the most successful acts of all time. The rapper now stands as the artist with the fifth-most top 40 wins ever, with 68 total.  By adding a dozen smashes to his ever-expanding Hot 100 successes, West passes both Elton John (57) and Nicki Minaj (62), supplanting the latter as the musician with the fifth-most placements in the area, at least for the moment. Drake is in a very distant first place among all artists in terms of top 40 hits, as he has already accrued 122 appearances inside the tier. He is the only act with a triple-digit total, and he’s about to see that figure increase noticeably. The rapper’s Certified Lover Boy album is about to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 next week, and it’s entirely possible that all 21 songs featured on the set will break into the top 40. Even if that doesn’t end up being the case, he will surely grow his total by at least 10, if not many more, in just a few days. Lil Wayne, a friend, collaborator and mentor of Drake’s, is in second place on the ranking of the musicians with the most top 40 hits in U.S. history, with 85. Elvis Presley comes next with 81, and Taylor Swift is just one smash behind the legendary rocker. She will likely tie the late, great artist soon, and she could easily pass him before 2021 is over.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/09/kanye-west-now-claims-the-fifth-most-top-40-hits-in-us-history-as-his-new-album-arrives/,Kanye West Now Claims The Fifth-Most Top 40 Hits In U.S. History As His New Album Arrives

  series The Mandalorian, will be turned into a 41-foot-high, 37-foot-wide, and 29-foot-long helium balloon that will float above the streets of Manhattan during the parade, Funko, Macy’s, and Mandalorian production company Lucasfilm announced today. Funko will be selling a limited edition collectible figure based on its Grogu Macy's parade balloon. For Funko CEO Brian Mariotti, the balloon is a fitting symbol for Funko’s soaring results over the past year. The publicly-traded company reported the three best quarters in its history, in Q4 2020 and Q1 and Q2 in 2021, and is projecting 2021 sales of $915 million, up 15% over pre-pandemic 2019.  “It’s a validation of all the things we’ve done right,” said Mariotti. Funko CEO Brian Mariotti Mariotti jokes that he is negotiating for the right to ride on top of the balloon. Mariotti and a large contingent of Funko employees plan to be in New York for the parade.  “We’re insanely excited for this opportunity. It really is a slice of Americana,” he said.  The Grogu balloon will be part of the parade for at least three years, according to the terms of the deal.  Mariotti bought Funko in 2005, introduced the bestselling Pop! vinyl figures with their signature oversized bobbleheads and big eyes in 2010, and took the company public in 2017. While the initial IPO was a disaster, with shares plunging more than 40% from the initial IPO price of $12, the stock this year has rewarded the company for recovering from a pandemic that closed most of the retail stores where its products were sold. It closed at $18.87 Wednesday, and one analyst recently set a $25 target for the stock. During 2020, Funko ramped up its direct-to-consumer sales through its Funko.com website and launched its European e-commerce site, Funkoeurope.com in Fall, 2020, three years ahead of the original schedule.  Its direct ecommerce sales have grown from less than 4% of the business in 2018 to 11% this year, Johanna Gepford, senior vice president, direct to consumer, at Funko, said. In the last 18 months, Gepford said, e-commerce sales have become a larger revenue source than any single retail account. “The most impressive element of Funko’s recent success is how quickly the company was able to rebuild and expand its direct-to-consumer business during the pandemic,” said James Zahn, deputy editor of The Toy Book and Senior Editor of The Pop Insider. Previously, Zahn said, Funko had been increasingly tethered to live events, like comic-cons, to drive sales. When the first comic con cancellation occurred at the beginning of the pandemic, Funko immediately created a virtual event, and quickly rebuilt their websites to better sell products, and host virtual events, Zahn said. The Funko Macy’s Grogu balloon will be replicated in a limited edition Funko Pop! figure that will be sold primarily through Funko’s direct-to consumer channels - its websites and its two Funko retail stores, in Everett and Hollywood. It also will be sold at the Macy’s Herald Square flagship in New York. An artist's rendering of the Funko Pop! Grogu balloon that will fly in this year's Macy's ... [+] Thanksgiving Day parade. A big part of Funko’s strategy is keeping supply limited for its collectibles. “You don’t want to over-produce,” Mariotti said. “Having your product sitting on shelves and being clearanced out all the time because you’re trying to take every last penny from every one of your retail partners is just not the way to go.” “We’re obsessed with sell-through, not sell-in,” he said, and would rather retire a product than over-produce it. Funko isn’t revealing how many of the Macy’s Parade Grogu figures will be produced, but Gepford said limited editions exclusives often sell out within 30 minutes of going on sale.  Funko also will be selling t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing items featuring the Grogu balloon.  A few years ago, Zahn said, Funko might have been viewed as a niche collectible company, but its recent rapid growth means it is being taken a lot more seriously. “Few companies have been able to connect with consumers of all ages the way that Funko has,” he said. “And as Funko continues to expand into new categories, it’s taking more space at retail and rightfully raising a few eyebrows as to which categories its team might tackle next.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2021/09/09/collectibles-brand-funko-reaches-new-heights-with-record-sales-macys-balloon/,"Collectibles Brand Funko Reaches New Heights With Record Sales, Macy’s Balloon"
"With Christmas sales being so crucial for retailers and brands, one of the most commonly asked ... [+] questions is ""how much stock should I order""? As the festive quarter gets ever closer - one question on retailer’s and brand's minds will be how much stock to order.  It can feel very abstract and difficult to quantify how much a business might sell during the busiest periods of the retail year, however there are some starting points to ensure the process is more focused, planned and ultimately results in successful Christmas sales and stock management.  Firstly, retailers should review their hero products, they are crucial for Christmas planning as they are the building blocks for a Christmas campaign. Often, they are items in a range that are very giftable, suitable for the Christmas season, that doesn’t mean they have to be Christmas themed but of course can be.  Bestsellers throughout the year are usually chosen as hero products by the big retailers and then become a focus for Christmas. Retailers consider hero products first and foremost – it’s what they will spend most of their time thinking about. Looking back at the sales history of those products will be key – thinking about the 80/20 rule – 80% of sales are likely to be coming from 20% of products. These are the products that will feature on a business’s homepage, social media feeds and in emails campaigns. Budget will be spent on obtaining great images showcasing these products to really make them shine.  A sales plan for the last quarter of the year is obviously vital, it’s the largest selling period for retailers. Without one it’s very hard for a business to get a sense of how much stock they should order in. Many newer businesses will have to make assumptions about Christmas sales – such as will October be 50% up on an average sales month, November even higher and so on.  The big retailers know well, sales plans are not about being 100% accurate but using some solid history and knowledge about sales figures to forecast this period – it will be different to the rest of the selling year. It also gives businesses a goal to aim for and work hard to achieve whilst being able to check in with a structured plan throughout those 3 months - pivoting and adjusting where necessary. This varies depending on the product. For each product item ordered retailers should be asking this question.  If a business stocks an overtly Christmas themed product, a Santa candle for example, they don’t want any of that stock leftover come the 26th December.  Sitting on this type of product until the following year can impact cashflow, cause storage issues or worse if it’s a perishable item it goes to wastage – so ordering on the conservative side is the right option. At the other end of the spectrum a product that a business sells well all year round, is likely to have a spike at Christmas but also may have long lead times – is the product you want to order generously, based on figures and assumptions. In this case the worse thing to happen is running out of stock and not having time to reorder. So retailers do need to take calculated risks for their decision making process on how much stock to purchase for Christmas, however these decisions will be informed by sales history and patterns, alongside some informed assumptions.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherineerdly/2021/09/09/how-much-stock-to-order-for-christmas-what-small-businesses-need-to-know/,How Much Stock To Order For Christmas: What Small Businesses Need To Know
"Carson Wentz underwent foot surgery in August, but is set to begin the season as Indy's starting QB. ... [+] (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Football is a war of attrition – that is true even before a season begins. Some NFL teams have already been ravaged by injury issues to key players, whether from training camp and the preseason or lingering issues from last season. That includes players that have already landed on Injured Reserve (IR) or are simply nursing injuries that could prevent them from playing their best early on.  This isn’t necessarily a list of the teams with the most total players injured, but more so the teams that will likely be impacted the most by injuries at the beginning of the 2021 NFL season. The summer was a nightmare for the Ravens. The injuries piled up, especially on the offensive side of the ball.  Two of their top running backs – J.K. Dobbins and Justice Hill – both suffered season-ending injuries. Baltimore had to sign Le'Veon Bell to their practice roster as a result. No team relied more heavily on their run game last season than the Ravens, and they had to rebuild their running back room on the fly. Receivers Rashod Bateman and Miles Boykin were both placed on IR, which means they will miss at least the first three weeks of the regular season. Speedster Marquise Brown didn’t play at all in the preseason and is nursing a hamstring injury. Three of the Ravens’ four top receivers are hurt; the fourth is the oft-injured Sammy Watkins. Even though the Ravens have one of the league’s best coaches and a former MVP quarterback, it wouldn’t be shocking if they stumble out of the gate to start the season. Colts quarterback Carson Wentz and guard Quenton Nelson are two foundational pieces of the Indianapolis offense this season, and both underwent foot surgery in August. Even though both players are on track to start the season, they are still working through rehab for those surgeries, missed almost all of training camp and spent time on the reserve/Covid-19 list as well. Will they truly be ready to play come Week 1 against the Seattle Seahawks? For Wentz in particular, it was a worrisome development considering he is coming off a dreadful 2020 season and he is joining a brand-new team. The Colts acquired Wentz for two draft picks in the offseason: a third-round pick and conditional second-round pick that could turn into a first. Backup rookie quarterback Sam Ehlinger seemed poised to start the season when Wentz got hurt, but Ehlinger is now himself on IR. If Wentz isn’t ready to go, the Colts may have to go to their third option at quarterback. Longtime Colts receiver TY Hilton had neck surgery recently and landed on IR. Tackle Eric Fisher, who Indianapolis signed in free agency away from the Chiefs, is still working back from an Achilles injury from January. The Giants focused their offseason on improving their group of offensive playmakers, chiefly doing so by bringing in wide receivers Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney. Unfortunately for New York, both Golladay and Toney missed significant time in training camp, which could delay their full integration into the offense. Toney was the Giants’ first-round pick this year and Golladay was signed to a massives four-year, $72 million deal in free agency. Star running back Saquon Barkley is coming off a torn ACL injury that knocked him out of the 2020 season and starting cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who was acquired in free agency from the Titans, has been out of practice with an ankle injury.  Four of the Giants’ top five offensive playmakers are listed as questionable ahead of their Week 1 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers: Barkley, Golladay, Toney and tight end Evan Engram. That is not exactly a positive prospect considering that building up those offensive weapons was seen as mandatory in order to elevate third-year quarterback Daniel Jones this season. Kenny Golladay signed a massive free-agent contract, but missed time in training camp. (AP ... [+] Photo/John Munson) Due to various injuries, the Jets will have one of the NFL’s worst pass rush groups entering the season. Edge rusher Carl Lawson signed a three-year, $45 million deal in the offseason and subsequently ruptured his Achilles’ tendon in a joint practice this summer, ending his season before it even began. Fellow defensive end Vinny Curry will also miss the 2021 season due to a rare blood disorder detected in late-August. The Jets have had a notoriously-difficult time acquiring a star pass rusher in years past. They may have found one in Lawson, but they won’t be able to lean on him this season. Linebacker Jarrad Davis is also set to miss the first several weeks of the season with an ankle injury that landed him on IR.  The Saints will be without one of the league’s best receivers for the early part of the season: Michael Thomas. After missing just one game in his first four NFL seasons, Thomas missed nine last season and is set to miss several more games in 2021 after undergoing ankle surgery in the summer. The former NFL Offensive Player of the Year signed a five-year, $100 million contract extension in the summer of 2019. The Saints’ cornerback corp is in rough shape outside of Marshon Lattimore. Cornerbacks Brian Poole and Ken Crawley will miss the first couple weeks of the season. New Orleans has attempted to remedy that situation by signing Desmond Trufant and trading for Bradley Roby. Additionally, defensive tackle David Onyemata will be suspended for the first six games of the season due to violating the league’s PED policy.  Although he reportedly avoided a major injury, starting tight end Adam Trautman hurt his foot late in the preseason and backup tight end Nick Vannett will begin the season on IR. Kicker Wil Lutz, one of the league’s best at his position, underwent a procedure to address a core muscle injury and will miss at least the first three games of the season.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/liamfox/2021/09/09/5-nfl-teams-dealing-with-injury-issues-entering-the-season/,5 NFL Teams Dealing With Injury Issues Entering The Season
"New York Giants NFL football quarterback Eli Manning poses with his family and parents including ... [+] Archie Manning after announcing his retirement on Friday, Jan. 24, 2020, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) On Sunday afternoon, Eli Manning will sit in the stands with his wife and four children at the New York Giants-Denver Broncos season opener at MetLife Stadium. It will be the first time Manning has attended a Giants game as a fan and the first time he’s been at an NFL game in any capacity since retiring in January 2020 following 16 seasons as the Giants’ starting quarterback.   And then, on Monday, Manning will be in the spotlight again, albeit in a different role than usual. He is joining his brother and fellow former NFL star quarterback, Peyton, as the co-hosts of an alternate Monday Night Football telecast of the Baltimore Ravens-Las Vegas Raiders game on ESPN2 and the ESPN+ streaming service.  Numerous television executives have reached out to the Manning brothers about broadcasting games or serving as studio analysts. But until now, they have rebuffed all offers. This time, the chance to work together in a relaxed atmosphere proved too tempting to pass up.  ESPN will still have a traditional telecast with Steve Levy as the play-by-play anchor and Louis Riddick and Brian Griese as analysts. The Mannings will not try to compete with them but rather provide an alternative where they will analyze the action, have guests and banter with each other.  The deal between ESPN and Peyton’s Omaha Productions company calls for Eli and Peyton to broadcast 10 Monday Night games this season as well as in 2022 and 2023. The Mannings will be working from their homes, too, which was an attractive selling point considering they don’t have to travel and can be around their families. “I don’t think I’ve watched a Monday Night Football game with my brother in probably 25 years,” Eli Manning said. “We’ll just be at home watching the game, analyzing certain plays, telling stories.” He added: “You can kind of make it much more casual, much more relaxed. You don’t have to analyze every single play. You don’t have to know every single player on the team. It’s more like a fan just watching the game on their couch.” Despite their lack of live television experience, the Mannings say they will benefit from their tight bond as brothers and their 33 years of combined NFL playing experience. For the past few weeks, they have been practicing by calling games from last season and this preseason.  “We’re just working out the kinks, working out the different technology and the different access we have to replays,” Eli Manning said. “We’ve had a lot of fun so far. I think each week is going to be a little bit of a learning experience to see what works, what fans like, what didn’t work so well. We’ll make adjustments each and every week.” Besides the broadcasting, Eli Manning is staying busy through work with corporate sponsors, including Verizon, with whom he’s working as a spokesman for the company’s 5G Multi-View system that’s available on seven NFL team’s apps. The system allows fans to access statistics and watch seven different camera angles during games. This summer, Eli also began working for the Giants in a part-time business operations and fan engagement role. His duties include meeting with the team’s sponsors and helping the franchise maintain and develop strong relationships with corporations. “I just wanted to give back to the organization and help out in any way,” Manning said. “Now with some of the Covid stuff, you’re not allowed in certain areas, not allowed to be around players and all these different rules. But hopefully I’ll get more involved. I just enjoy being back with them.” Still, the job with the Giants is not a full-time commitment, allowing Manning the flexibility to be around his family much more than when he was a player. His three daughters are all in elementary school and part of teams in basketball, swimming, lacrosse, softball and other sports, so he loves watching their games and coaching them. And his two-and-half-year old son likes to play with trucks, shoot baskets at a mini-hoop, swing the Wiffle ball bat and participate in neighborhood kickball games. He’s joining a soccer team this month, too.  Manning is following the path set by his mother, Olivia, and father, former NFL quarterback Archie, both of whom introduced their children to as many activities as possible. “I raise my kids the way I was raised,” Manning said. “We played a lot of sports. Whatever the season it was, we played that sport. We were just active and working on teamwork and the great life lessons that sports teach you.” He added: “I think it is so important for kids to make friends that play different sports and go to different schools. We throw them into as many sports as possible. As they get a little bit older, they can start weaning some out and find out which ones they like a little bit more and which ones they don’t.” Manning, who lives in New Jersey, expects to take his children to most of the Giants’ home games this year, as well, including the Sept. 26 game against the Atlanta Falcons. That afternoon, the franchise will induct Manning into its Ring of Honor, becoming the 43rd player to achieve that honor. And they will retire his jersey No. 10, only the 13th player to have that distinction. The Giants are also retiring Michael Strahan’s No. 92 in November. The honors are appropriate for Manning, who led the Giants to two Super Bowl championships after the 2007 and 2011 seasons, winning the Most Valuable Player award both times. He never missed a game due to an injury and played in a Giants-record 236 regular season games, including 234 starts, the fourth-most with one franchise behind Tom Brady with the New England Patriots, Brett Favre with the Green Bay Packers and Dan Marino with the Miami Dolphins.  Manning is first on the Giants’ all-time regular season list in pass attempts (8,119), completions (4,895), yards (57,023) and touchdowns (366). He was even better in the postseason, completing 60.5% of his passes (242 of 400) for 2,815 yards and 18 touchdowns in 12 games.  After the Super Bowl victory in February 2012 at MetLife Stadium, Manning only played in one more playoff game, a wild card loss in January 2017 at the Packers. Still, New York fans will always remember Manning for his durability, toughness and two titles. They will have another chance to show their appreciation later this month during the jersey retirement ceremony. “It’s definitely going to be a special day,” Manning said. “I’m just excited to get to share that with my teammates who will be there and with the fans. You don’t always get a farewell and to say thank you and say goodbye to your fans.” He added: “To get that honor, to get your number retired by the New York Giants, that’s a storied organization. It’s truly an honor. That will be an emotional day.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timcasey/2021/09/09/eli-manning-discusses-monday-night-football-broadcasting-debut-upcoming-nfl-season-and-retirement/,"Eli Manning Discusses Monday Night Football Broadcasting Debut, Upcoming NFL Season And Retirement"
"An EA-18G Growler attached to the Shadowhawks of Electronic Attack Squadron 141 launches from the ... [+] flight deck of the U.S. Navy’s only forward-deployed aircraft carrier USS 'Ronald Reagan.' The Chinese air force is very clear how it would respond if, during wartime, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier were to sail into the South China Sea—waters that Beijing increasingly claims as its own, in violation of longstanding international law. In a word, bombers. Every time an American flattop has sailed into the South China Sea in recent months, a powerful formation of Chinese warplanes—always including H-6 bombers—has launched the very same day. Twitter user @duandang, a popular purveyor of so-called “open-source intelligence,” highlighted the trend.  Duan Dang’s shorthand tells a story. On or right before Jan. 23, the Nimitz-class nuclear supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt sailed with her escorts—a cruiser and two destroyers—into the South China Sea via the Luzon Strait. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force assembled a powerful air group—a Y-8 patrol plane, eight H-6s and four J-16 fighters—in a dramatic show of force. The 13 planes flew into the South China Sea west of Taiwan, not far from Roosevelt’s own position. The PLAAF’s roughly 150 twin-engine H-6s, which Chinese industry developed from the Soviet Tu-16, are the air force’s most potent long-range strikers. The latest H-6K, H-6M carry the YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missile, which boasts a 200-mile range and a warhead weighing around a thousand pounds. Bombers packing cruise missiles aren’t China’s only weapons for attacking American carriers. Land-based anti-ship ballistic missiles are at least as dangerous to the flattops. But as a signal, the bombers can’t be beat. A U.S. carrier sails into China’s near waters, bombers take off.  It has happened time and again this year. Roosevelt departed the South China Sea in April. On or around June 15, Roosevelt’s sister ship USS Ronald Reagan and one each destroyer and cruiser sailed into the South China Sea via the San Bernardino Strait. Guess what happened next? That’s right—a PLAAF air group including two Y-8s, two KJ-500 early-warning planes, four H-6s and 20 J-11 and J-16 fighters flew over the South China Sea south of Taiwan. Now flash forward three months to Sept. 5. the Nimitz-class USS Carl Vinson sailed through the Luzon Strait into the South China Sea, a cruiser, destroyer and Littoral Combat Ship in tow.  The same day, the Chinese sortied a Y-8, four H-6s and 14 J-16 and Su-30 fighters for their usual jaunt south of Taiwan. No one’s at war so no one gets hurts, of course. But that could change if, for instance, China makes good on its threat to invade Taiwan and the U.S. and allied navies deploy in response.  Owing to a vexxing lack of long-range warplanes, American flattops might have little choice but to enter the South China Sea for strikes on the Chinese invasion force. Chinese bombers undoubtedly would try to stop them.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/09/welcoming-committee-every-time-an-american-flattop-enters-the-south-china-sea-chinese-bombers-launch/,"Welcoming Committee—Every Time an American Flattop Enters The South China Sea, Chinese Bombers Launch"
"12v compressor fridge (Alpicool T36) used for road trip. See below. Recently a large number of 12 volt mobile refrigerators have come on the market for use in cars. You would think they would be a perfect match for an electric car with its giant battery, but mistakes by Tesla 
  
  TSLA 
  make this much harder than it should be. These are compressor-based fridges, like the ones in homes, and able to maintain cold temperatures, including freezing, with high efficiency. This is different from the old peltier based fridges which are cheap, inefficient, and can only drop the temperature about 40 degrees F. (In other words, on a hot day, they can’t keep food at a safe temperature, and need supplementation with ice.) People have keep ice-based coolers in the car on road trips for a long time. They are handy for cold drinks and perishable snacks, and can be used to keep leftovers or shop for things like cheeses and meats. They are work to maintain, though, needing constant replacement of the ice. Water condenses and pools on the bottom, and you are going to make mistakes from time to time and lose some of your perishable food. It’s often necessary to take all the food or the whole cooler up to hotel rooms to use the fridge there, unless there is enough ice to last the night. These compressor fridges only draw about 40 watts, and run about 1/3rd of the time. They plug into the 12v accessory port (often known as the cigarette lighter port) of any car. With this power load they will use about 400 watt-hours of energy to run all day. That’s OK when you’re driving, but it’s enough to seriously drain a typical gasoline car battery if left for half a day. Because of this, they all can be set to shut off if they take the battery too low — a decision that it is better to let the fridge get a bit warm than to not be able to start the car. In an electric car, however, 400 watt-hours is nothing. Less than 2 miles of range for a day’s cooling. Now you have an option for a fridge that will stay properly cold for the full duration of the trip, with no maintenance or addition of ice. The cost comes in money (these will be $250 to $500 to buy) and weight, and the space taken up by the compressor, though that space is comparable to the space taken up by ice. There is also a small amount of noise when it runs. The fridge also has other uses at home, such as:   This is #2 in a series on EV road trips. See part 1, about using the CHAdeMO charging adapter in a Tesla. Part 3 will be on general remote-area charging. As noted, only using up 2 miles of range in a day sounds great. The problem is that Tesla’s system is designed so that for the accessory port to be on, the car computer system must be fully on, and that draws around 300 watts. 300 watts to allow you to turn on a fridge that averages 15 watts. The Tesla is designed to go to sleep when it can, and turn off most of its systems, including the 12v port. In that mode, you can’t just leave the fridge sitting in the car for long periods. It is of course also a well insulated cooler, so it can handle an hour or two, but not much more. There are ways to command the Tesla not to go to sleep. The simplest is to turn on its “Sentry mode” security system, which watches suspicious activity near the car and logs video of it. The trouble is this draws all this power. Leave it on overnight and you will lose about 15 miles of range. This is also true for other methods like “Camp Mode” and the Summon Standby mode. That’s not an issue if you’re plugged in, or you are on the way to the charger in the morning, but sometimes you are conserving range and this is not a good idea. So you need other solutions. The simplest solution is to put or keep some ice in the fridge. You don’t need to put in as much as you do in a cooler, and you only need it when you will have these longer sleep periods. The problem is, you’ve just eliminated one of the core benefits of the fridge — not having to fuss with ice. Ice is a hassle. You can buy bags of far too much ice at stores. You can fill bags of ice at most US hotels and motels, but you need a very sturdy one or it will leak and they all get condensation on them. You can also freeze water bottles and ice packs, placing them in a plastic bag to capture the condensation. Problem is that most hotel mini-fridges aren’t able to freeze ice packs. Another solution would be to have a backup battery with about 200 watt-hours in it, enough to last the night and other long stops. The battery would charge when the power is on, and power the fridge when it’s off. This also can work but is pretty stupid in a car where you have a giant battery just sitting there. Portable battery packs are popular but cost around $200 — a large fraction of the cost of the fridge. A lead-acid battery could do it for a much lower price but products of this sort are not readily available — the fridge makers would do well to make it an option to connect a standard battery to their fridges, both in gasoline cars and EVs. A surprising option also worked with the fridge I bought, an Alpicool T-36. This unit can have two chambers at two temperatures, commonly to have a fridge and freezer. I don’t have too much use for a freezer on the road, so I set one chamber at 36 degrees for perishables and the other at 45 for drinks. I found that by placing a rectangular juice bottle of ice against the back wall of the colder section, right where the cooling coils are, that it would keep a frozen bottle frozen! Only if I had to go 2 nights conserving range did I need to replace the ice. Better, but still not perfect. You don’t need ice in the 45 degree chamber, as drinks can handle getting warmer. Another good solution for the fridge makers would be to offer a deliberate place to put water on the cooling coils. If an owner filled that with water, it would freeze that water and use that for cooling when off. Turns out ice is a great way to store energy, much cheaper than a battery, if what you want is energy for cooling. Each day, while driving, the ice would be re-frozen, ready to cool in the night and daytime breaks. Customers have been curious. The Tesla has a power DC to DC converter which converts the 350 volts of the main battery down to 12 volts to run computers and accessories. This is shut off when the car goes to sleep, so the car also has a standard 12v battery the same as any gasoline car. This battery provides power when the car is asleep. If needed, every so often it turns on this computer to keep the battery from getting low. It is speculated that an extra constant drain on this battery would degrade it faster — these batteries are notorious for failure — but this is unconfirmed. Some owners have put manual taps onto the 12v power to plug in smaller things, but it requires hardware modification. Perhaps Tesla does have a way, in future firmware, to allow you to turn on the DC->DC without turning on the other computers for a lower draw.  Also possible would be turning on that converter (or even the whole 300w ensemble) for 1/3rd of the time, and sleeping only 2/3rds of the time. That would power a fridge with more drain that you would like, but a great deal less drain than running at full all the time. Tesla could even be clever and watch the fridge’s power draw, turning on power until it stops running, and then going to sleep for a while after that. Some EVs have or will have a 120v outlet in them, powered from their internal battery by means of a dedicated inverter. Tesla did not put such an outlet in their cars. While less efficient, these fridges usually come with a converter to turn this back to 12vdc, as long as that inverter is always-on. Some vehicles, such as the high-end Ford F-150 promise an inverter big enough to power big power tools and even a home. To be used for a fridge they must be able to work at low power for low, constant loads. There are a wide variety of 12v compressor fridges available on the market, most imported from China. They are heavier and bigger than many coolers, needing the space for the compressor, though a cooler would typically take up more than that space with ice. There are higher priced domestic brands as well. The Alpicool was purchased because of decent reviews from customers. This particular model, the T-36, is unusual at the price point for having the ability to split it into two compartments at two temperatures, including one being a freezer. As a freezer it took almost 2 days to freeze a gallon of ice, though, but it worked. It’s not clear how much you want a freezer on a road trip, but it’s valuable in an RV. In almost all cases you can get the same unit in different sizes by getting taller versions. This version is long (taking up 1.5 passenger seats in the back seat) but short enough to go in a trunk. It has other minor features such as a USB port and a bluetooth interface. At first I thought the bluetooth would be a gimmick, but it does make it slightly easier to configure, but also lets you confirm from a distance that it’s on and what temperature it’s at. When experimenting with overnight power, that turned out to be useful. (There is no security, so a griefer could turn off your fridge remotely and spoil your food.) The biggest flaw in this unit is the lid. It snaps closed just with friction. As it ships it is far too tight, you need two arms just to open the lid! You can file down the tabs but this has risks of its own and it’s still hard to open. Far better would be a magnetic seal as used on almost all home fridges, or a latch. This lid is such a poor choice that on its own it is enough to consider other units. This one has wheels — full of food it can be quite heavy, and this would make it easy to move it to a hotel room as long as you are not climbing stairs. We did not end up doing that — the goal was to leave it in the car on battery power, and just take a few food items up to the room as desired. It comes with an AC power unit if you do that, which presents another option to power it overnight if you park near a plug. (If you park a Tesla near a plug you can also charge the car and leave the fridge and computer on, but not all plugs are up to that challenge and this will use up 15 of the 50 miles you would gain that way to run the fridge.) If you’re wondering about the cardboard box, it’s there because for any top-load cooler or fridge, as you take bottles out, small items will fall into the space they occupied and you have to fuss quite a bit to put things back in. This unit comes with two wire baskets that are not of much use — but a way to organize sections for different items would be very handy. A fridge can make it easy to have a picnic at any charging stop, especially in a rural rest area. ... [+] More chargers should have picnic tables, but you can also carry gear in your car. This may be too much work just for cold drinks. Drinks, after all, survive if your ice runs out, while perishable food spoils. It can be nice, and save a fair bit of money to carry food for making breakfasts and dinners in motel rooms with kitchens, or just a microwave. As an alternative, there are also non-perishable foods. Many in the USA don’t know it, but only in the US and Canada do they require that eggs be washed before sale in stores, which requires them to be refrigerated. In the rest of the world, eggs are sold unwashed and kept at room temperature. You can often find such eggs from farmstands. Nonetheless, it is nice even when eating at restaurants to be able to take the leftovers and to have other foods on hand, and many find it worth it. These fridges are also becoming popular in small RVs. Traditional RV fridges work by boiling a refrigerant and letting it condense. They usually boil it with propane, but can do so with electricity. They can even boil it with 12v electricity but they are very inefficient, and running an RV fridge off 12v will drain batteries quickly. These new compressor fridges can’t run off propane but can run off electrical systems with decent batteries particularly if those are supplemented with solar or occasional generator operation. The main virtue of propane is that a typical RV can run its heating and fridge operations for many weeks on a large propane tank, leaving little risk that a drained battery will spoil food. In time, the ability to have a fridge that can run for months on the EV battery will inspire some EVs to include a fridge built into the vehicle, particularly EVs aimed at the road trip and recreational/off-road market. These will be designed to work with the EV power system and perhaps take power directly from the high voltage battery. These fridges are only good for local trips. Due to the internal fluids they may not be something one can ship on an airplane, though it would make sense for car rental companies or others to rent them to people doing a fly/drive road trip. Then the extra battery could even be part of the package.

Plus: how a Premier League legend is trying to improve mental health in the workplace. A New York-based family office has acquired a minority stake in Serie B's Ascoli Calcio, further demonstrating American investors' growing interest in Italian soccer. With the U.S. expected to reach the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and set to co-host the 2026 tournament, Christian Pulisic could be the national team's biggest star ever, and he's confident he can wield the marketing opportunities that come with it. ""I think I expected it in a way,"" he says of the increased attention after his move to the Premier League. Manchester United may have pulled off the biggest transfer coup of the summer by bringing back Cristiano Ronaldo, but its women's team's acquisition of Norwegian playmaker Vilde Bøe Risa could prove just as decisive. To aid the recovery from operating losses during the pandemic, the NHL is adding sponsor patches to its sweaters. Any branding risk the move may create is firmly outweighed by the reward: NHL teams generated more than $100 million in revenue by adding helmet ads last year. Meanwhile, the women's game is going through a radical marketing change of its own, rebranding from the National Women's Hockey League to the Premier Hockey Federation. Kurt Busch plans to move to Michael Jordan's 23XI Racing for his 23rd, and possibly final, Nascar season, and he's bringing an old friend with him: longtime sponsor Monster Energy. Nascar could be in for a shakeup in 2022 as several big-name drivers hit the free-agent market. Seemingly on his last legs as a competitive Cup Series driver, 43-year-old Ryan Newman may struggle to find suitors willing to pay his going rate. While Austin Dillon has statistical limitations, the 2018 Daytona 500 winner is a solid bet, as shown by his four playoff appearances in six seasons. Ryan Preece is talented, and an efficient passer, but an upgrade to a more competitive team will depend on sponsor funding. Despite having qualified for the playoffs in 2020, Matt DiBenedetto faces the prospect of having to leave the Cup Series altogether. Michael McDowell could have commanded a raise after winning this year's Daytona 500, but he's seeking an extension that will allow Front Row Motorsports to continue its growth. It's a busy time for Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum—he recently announced a new deal with wearables company LaceClips and succeeded Chris Paul as the NBA players' union's president—but his focus remains the same, he tells us. Retired WNBA star Morgan Tuck is rejoining the Connecticut Sun as director of franchise development, putting her in a position to oversee the team's activism initiatives and removing any doubt that the league will continue fighting for social change. Influencer marketing and talent agency Viral Nation is entering the name, image and likeness space with the launch of a division focused on high school and college athletes. It already has the sons of two well-known former NBA players—Penny Hardaway and Kenny Smith—on its roster.

"Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, pictured during a parliamentary session to review ... [+] President Raisi's cabinet selection, in Tehran, Iran on August 21, 2021. (Photo: ATTA KENARE / AFP) (Photo by ATTA KENARE/AFP via Getty Images) The new government in Tehran is reaching out to its Gulf neighbors, as talks over the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S. looks increasingly shaky. In the past 24 hours, recently-appointed foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has held talks with at least two of his counterparts in the region, with speculation that other meetings will follow. Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdulrahman al-Thani was in Tehran on August 9 for a meeting with Amir-Abdollahian. Local media in Iran noted that the visit came soon after Sheikh Mohammad had held talks with U.S. secretary of state Anthony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin in Doha. Indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran to revive the 2015 nuclear deal – which then-president Donald Trump reneged on in May 2018 – have stalled in recent weeks, with Blinken warning on August 8 that time was running out. However, Gulf interlocutors may yet be able to help find a way forward.  It is not only Qatar that could help that process. Local media in Iran also reported on September 9 that Amir-Abdollahian had received a phone call from UAE minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Oman is also another potentially pivotal player, with good relations with both the U.S. and Iran. Amir-Abdollahian is a well-known figure in the Arab Gulf states, having previously served as Iran’s ambassador to Bahrain in a career which has been heavily focused on the region. While the prospects for a revived nuclear deal are likely to have featured in his talks with regional counterparts, there are numerous other issues which the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – are concerned about, including Iran’s ballistic missile program and its support for militias in Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. The Iranian foreign minister made a notable entrance on the regional diplomatic stage in late August, on his first trip abroad as minister. At a regional summit in Baghdad, he abandoned protocol and stood alongside heads of state and government in a group photocall, rather than with his foreign minister counterparts. As well as making Amir-Abdollahian look petty or naïve in some people’s eyes, it may also have set back some bilateral relations.   While at the summit, Amir-Abdollahian said he had a “positive and cordial” conversation with UAE prime minister and ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. However, an opportunity to speak with Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Farhan bin Faisal was apparently missed due to the photoshoot kerfuffle.

It has a relatively good relationship with Oman and Kuwait, based on those countries efforts to maintain a neutral role in regional disputes. Its ties with Qatar were markedly strengthened during the three and a half years in which Qatar faced a trade and travel boycott by Bahrain, the UAE and Saudi Arabia – that dispute ended in January, but both Doha and Tehran appear keen to retain strong ties. The two countries also share a massive gas field, known as the North Field in Qatar and South Pars in Iran. Relations with the other GCC states have been more difficult. Iran has had a long-running territorial dispute with the UAE over three Gulf islands– Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa – which Tehran controls but the UAE claims. Despite that, business ties between the two countries have historically been strong, with Dubai acting as a gateway for Iranian trade with the wider world and also being home to a large number of Iranians.  It was notable that Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE all sent representatives to the inauguration of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran in early August. Saudi Arabia, however, did not.  Tehran’s relations with Riyadh tend to be more strained – not least because the two countries are on opposite sides of the Yemen conflict. Iran is believed to be a key facilitator of missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.  More broadly, the two countries see each other as natural regional rivals. However, they have also been exploring ways to improve the tone. Earlier this year, Iraq hosted a series of meetings between Iranian and Saudi officials and those talks are expected to resume in in the near future. The one country which has yet to offer any sign that it might be interested in talking to Iran is Bahrain, which often blames its much larger neighbor for encouraging protests and other political activism by members of its majority Shia population.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2021/09/09/iran-reaches-out-to-neighbors-as-us-warns-over-nuclear-talks/,Iran Reaches Out To Neighbors As U.S. Warns Over Nuclear Talks
"Shoppers in Los Angeles. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Consumer will spend more in 2022, thanks to both their own earnings and generous cash given them by the government in 2020 and 2021. Spending generally increases with income, but not in the naïve lockstep fashion described in economics textbooks. People tend to maintain a fairly stable level of spending despite occasional fluctuations in their income. Some folks live paycheck to paycheck and have to cut back spending when they lose a job, but most people have a combination of reserves, credit and family that enable them to keep their spending fairly stable. Stability also means they don’t splurge too much when they have extra cash. A family that routines spends 99% of its take-home pay will usually not spend 99% of an inheritance or lottery win, at least not immediately. Milton Friedman capsulized this common-sense concept in the permanent income hypothesis, which was cited in his Nobel Prize award. He argued that people spent based on their expected long-term average income, which he called permanent income. Stimulus income did not push spending up. In 2020 and 2021, American consumers understood that the various stimulus checks they received would not be permanent, and per Friedman’s theory they saved a very high percentage of the stimulus money. The chart shows clearly that the boost in income from government stimulus payments was mostly saved, not spent. Yet this money will have an impact over time. Many consumers paid down their credit card bills. (We economists consider paying down debt a form of saving). With less debt, people will feel confident spending more. The summer 2021 Covid wave hurt attitudes. Consumer attitudes have dipped as the Covid caseload has increased over the summer. Attitudes had rebounded from pandemic lows, reaching strong levels in April 2021, as vaccinations gave us confidence that the worst of the pandemic was behind us. The summer surge, though, has torpedoed consumer optimism. Usually attitudes are a result of economic conditions, not a cause of economic conditions. When unemployment, inflation and interest rates are all low, consumers are pretty happy. The surveys of consumers aren’t needed in those times. But with huge non-economic impacts on consumers, the surveys are valuable, and they now show consumers are worried. What will win out when consumers have money, but they are worried? I’m betting on money, though the worries will temper the spending. But we must also question how much stuff can consumers actually get their hands on. Cars are harder to buy than usual, with some models on back order. Boats are also hard to come by. One dealer said that they have cut back on their marketing because it’s easy to sell all the product that the manufacturers can deliver. Consumers would like to enjoy services as well, including dining out, traveling and attending concerts. The Covid pandemic triggered cutbacks in these areas. For food and other staples, consumers have the money to upgrade their purchases. Babies won’t be changed more often than usual, but their parents will buy the high-priced diapers because they can. All told, consumers have more capacity to spend than businesses have capacity to deliver goods and services. Aggregate consumer spending will certainly be higher in 2022, but not to the degree that consumers would like. Prices are likely to rise, and when the price tags are not actually changed, look for an absence of discounts and promotional sales. Companies providing goods will do best focusing on delivering product, letting marketing take care of itself. Service providers will have to walk a fine line between expansion and keeping customers and employees safe. Covid-19 has proved to be a cyclical disease, with dynamics that lead to sharp increases in infections, followed by sharp declines. All businesses, but especially those that see consumers face to face, will benefit from flexibility to ramp up and then ramp down as further waves of cases come through their communities. Looking beyond 2022, consumers may have pulled some of their spending from the future. Durable goods that might have been postponed for a few years were purchased, or at least ordered, when people could not travel or dine out. So future sales of backyard gazebos, treadmills and draperies may soften both because they have already been bought, and because people would rather travel. This won’t be recessionary, but the sectors that boomed in the pandemic will see flat sales at best, and in many cases moderate reductions.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2021/09/09/consumer-economic-forecast-2022-23-supply-will-limit-spending/,Consumer Economic Forecast 2022-23: Supply Will Limit Spending
"Tahith Chong of Birmingham City and John Fleck of Sheffield United during the Sky Bet Championship ... [+] match between Sheffield United and Birmingham City at Bramall Lane. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images) The Premier League might have had a relatively normal transfer window this summer, but the one-and-a-half billion dollars spent by top-flight clubs didn’t trickle down to England’s second-tier. Based on the figures from transfermarkt.com, Championship clubs only spent $56.5 million on transfer fees this summer, down from $87 million the summer before, and $200-300 million the few seasons before that. And of that $56.5 million of transfer fees this summer, 60% of the spending was from just two clubs: Fulham and Middlesbrough.  The other 22 clubs spent just over $20 million between them. With few other ways to improve their squads, Championship clubs are more reliant on Premier League loans than they have been in previous seasons. A good Premier League loan can completely change a Championship side’s season. Derby County under Frank Lampard reached the playoffs three seasons ago through the help of players like Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount. They missed out on promotion after losing to an Aston Villa side whose on-loan striker Tammy Abraham was the league’s second highest scorer with 25 goals. The season after that, Arsenal’s recent big-money signing Ben White was instrumental in helping Leeds United win promotion. Last season, Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott and Harry Wilson were key players for Blackburn and Cardiff, respectively. Swansea City’s loans of Marc Guehi from Chelsea and Freddie Woodman from Newcastle were among the club’s best players, and Nottingham Forest’s loan signing of England under-21 international James Garner from Manchester United was one bright spot in a dreadful season. James Garner of Nottingham Forest in action during the Sky Bet Championship match against Wycombe ... [+] Wanderers. (Photo by Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Forest persuaded Manchester United to lend them Garner for another season. Manager Chris Hughton might not have had the best of starts at the City Ground, but his positive influence on Garner was one of the reasons why the United midfielder returned to Nottingham for another year.  As loans become increasingly important for Championship sides, ability to nurture loan players as well as strong connections with top clubs, like Frank Lampard had when he was at Derby County in 2018-19, are increasingly useful attributes for a manager to have. As well as James Garner, Manchester United have loaned out Tahith Chong to Birmingham, Ethan Laird to Swansea, and Di’Shon Bernard to Hull City. With 16 appearances already for United as well as loan spells at Werder Bremen and Belgian side Club Brugge, 21-year-old Chong is among the more exciting of the players on loan in the Championship.  Slavia Prague's Senegalese striker Abdallah Sima hits this shot narrowly wide during the UEFA Europa ... [+] League match against Leicester City. (Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP) (Photo by ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP via Getty Images) Another key loan player could be Abdallah Sima. Brighton and Hove Albion signed the Senegal international from Slavia Prague for $9.6 million in the summer and loaned him straight to Stoke City to get experience of English soccer. He is joined at Stoke by fellow Brighton loanee Leo Ostigard, who also spent last year in the Championship with Coventry City. Brighton have four players out on loan in the Championship, and 11 players, only two of which are over 24 years old, out on loan in total. They appear to be trying to follow the path of loaning out large numbers of players — a strategy that has been used to great effect by clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea. Manchester City’s network of clubs around the world from New York to Melbourne means they often keep their loans in-house, but they have sent promising winger Morgan Rogers on loan to Bournemouth, and if he succeeds on the south coast, it could provide a win-win situation like former City player Jack Harrison’s loan spell at Leeds United. Chelsea have eight players on loan in the Championship, not far off a full squad, with some older players like Danny Drinkwater and Abdul Rahman-Baba among the Chelsea loanees. The total number of loan players in the Championship isn’t that different from previous years, and the quality of player seems pretty similar too. But Championship sides have suffered the double-whammy of empty stadiums and a massive drop in transfer revenue from Premier League clubs. The Championship as a whole made a net gain of around $90 million from transfers this summer, which is less than a third what it made the previous summer, and half what it made the summer before that.  As Premier League clubs looked for bargains from overseas, many Championship clubs failed to make a big-money sale. This meant they couldn’t afford transfer fees for players within the league, which then had a knock-on effect on other clubs.  There were only about twenty transfer fees paid across the whole of the Championship this summer, with most clubs spending no money at all and relying on free transfers. In such an environment, loans from the Premier League are one of the few ways to improve a squad, and those loan players could have an even greater impact on the season than they have in the past.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2021/09/09/premier-league-loan-signings-more-valuable-than-ever-for-championship-clubs/,Premier League Loan Signings More Valuable Than Ever For Championship Clubs

The German went on to win the gold medal that Djokovic had coveted while seeking a “Golden Slam” — all four major titles and Olympic gold — as well as the title in Cincinnati ahead of the U.S. Open. “I mean, it's the biggest tournament in the world, Tokyo,” Zverev said after his straight-sets quarterfinal win over South African Lloyd Harris Wednesday afternoon. “It's the Olympics. Winning there against the world No. 1, especially that I was down a set and a break, being kind of out of the match, then coming back, it was different than the other matches. The emotions were different. “Also securing a medal for Germany was very special to me. This year it seems like nobody can beat [Djokovic] in a big match, nobody can beat him at the Grand Slams. I feel like I was the first player to beat him in a very big match this year. “That does give you something. To any person it would give you something.

He has a tremendous serve. He got a lot of free points on his service games. Next thing you know he won it. He won it comfortably in the end. Deserved to win a gold medal obviously with the way he was playing. He hasn't lost a match since.” He added: “He's in a fantastic form. Next to Medvedev, best form. But it's best-of-five. It's Grand Slam. Of course looking at his results in past few years, he's played very well here on this court. He was a couple points away from his first slam last year against Dominic [Thiem]. “I know it's going to be battle, even harder than it was today. But I'm ready for it. Look, these are the hurdles that I need to overcome in order to get to the desired destination.

The Russian is into his third straight U.S. Open semifinal and will take on No. 12 Felix Auger-Aliassime, the young Canadian who is into his first major semifinal. Nothing less than winning his first major title will do for Medvedev after losing in the 2019 final to Nadal and the 2020 semis to Thiem.

"Sylvia Beach, founder and owner of the Shakespeare & Company bookstore in Paris decorates the ... [+] store's window. Beach's bookstore became an important part of the Paris literary scene from 1919 to 1941. We all know that the pandemic has created enormous challenges for the retail industry. Lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, social distancing and safety guidelines added costs and caused many retailers to shut their doors permanently. Looking to the future, however, I see two distinct types of opportunities emerging in retail.  To start, current retailers have high levels of job openings. Retailers need to rebuild staff, follow new operating policies, and even relocate or restructure the stores. All of that is driving demand for qualified associates. There are open positions in retailing as underscored by Walmart’s 
  
  WMT 
  announcement last Friday that the company will raise the salary of 565,000 associates since their skills were hard to replace. What I find even more interesting is the opportunity for fresh entrepreneurial thinking. New customer habits and retail operating models are also creating new business opportunities as well – a need more and different retailers, vendors, and related service partnerships.  There are many aspiring entrepreneurs focused on retailing. Last year more than 600,000 persons became self-employed after losing their job due to the pandemic. Many of them found opportunities in and around the retailing sector, while others turned to hospitality and health service.  Retail has many opportunities for entrepreneurs eager to rebuild a business or start one. I found numerous store listings posted; looking more carefully, I noticed that searches for Florida popped up as one of the favorite states. The warm weather makes it a year-round destination for young and old. Young people starting a business in Florida find the lack of state income tax a big help as they work to become profitable. Some of their effort is directed at support for older people as they are a big customer segment in the state. Post pandemic, they have needs for products and services (coupled with service support and the convenient delivery of their purchases) as they venture out and about again in a safe way. Health clinics abound in Florida, and they have needs for reliable products and services as well. The favorable climate also favors Texas; it too has an aging population that needs additional care. There is no state income tax in Texas and opportunities to assist shopping for the elderly have employed many in the state. Tennessee is another state that has zero personal income tax, a favorable factor for self-employment. In addition, the state is business friendly, and since there is the influx of many new businesses, the state now claims to be “the no. 1 place in the Southeast to start and grow a business.” I recently had a conversation with Tra Williams, an expert on entrepreneurship, franchise solutions and strategic leadership. He used himself as an example of a new entrepreneurial spirit responding to the changing retail environment and described how he started a new business. He started a truck driver school in Florida. He found that it had great appeal due to the shortage of drivers in the state needed to support delivery of all sorts of retail products and services – especially home delivery. He stressed that he perceived an unmet need, and he could fill the need with qualified drivers. He points out that when you perceive a need, you may be able to set up a successful new venture. One of the most helpful resources for entrepreneurs is the Small Business Administration (SBA) who guides investors on how to start a new business. Through the SBA, the federal government has made stimulus funds available which can be applied for. How to start a retail business? ·      Validate the opportunity: The first step would be to conduct market research and find out if there is a need for the business you want to create. You have to find out what competition there is selling the product and whether it can be sold it at a competitive price. ·      Write a business plan: Once you know that the product will sell, that there is a real need for it, the next step is to write a business plan. The plan should define the kind of store needed, who will run the store and how it will grow. This will be the roadmap for the venture and should incorporate some definite growth goals. Be sure to include measurable sales plans, number of stores, and staffing needs. It should extend over 3 or 5 years. ·      Line up funding: To start a viable business, you must fund it. It can start with family seeding the venture, but additional sources most likely must be tapped depending on the scope of the project. At the same time, you must look for your first location. Remember “location, location, location”. It is a slogan that resounds in every retailer’s head. The first location must be visible, in a trafficked spot and near public transportation or public parking. ·      Name your business: Naturally, your business must have a name. It is not easy to pick the perfect name You want a name that reflects your brand and captures your spirit. Dick Sporting Goods, the Sports Authority (now defunct), Academy Sports & Outdoors are some examples of descriptive names. Find one that consumers will be able to remember and associate with you. ·      Complete all legal registration forms: Next, you have to register your business. As a first step, you have to decide on your legal structure – define how you will run the business because that must be presented in the paperwork various government agencies require. Then comes the actual registration; the specific information needed is defined under the laws of your state. You must get federal and state identification numbers, and finally you must apply for licenses and permits to keep your business running smoothly. For instance, in the sports stores mentioned above you need permits to carry firearms, guns or ammunition. In the case of firearms, you must also keep records of what firearm you sold to whom. Oh yes, you must get federal and state tax IDs. Your business will run smoothly if you keep everything legally compliant. Some states do not have a state income tax, but there may be real estate taxes that must be paid.  ·      Set up a business banking relationship: Lastly, you will need a business bank account. A small business checking account can help to keep all activities legal and separate from personal banking activities. You may also find your banker is another helpful resource. Post Script: The help of the SBA can be invaluable for a new company. Their assorted guides and resources can help to define the store, the merchandise in the store, and identify the target customer you want to attract and who will buy the offering. Choosing a state to start the business can be very hard, since personal considerations will likely influence any decision. A young entrepreneur with a family wants a good school system, a middle-aged family wants good outdoor activities, and an older family wants good health care facilities.  Bottom line, the challenges can be enormous, but the rewards can be great in retail – the new retail of the future.

"Verizon, which sponsored Team Penske's Joey Logano at Watkins Glen International, is one of the ... [+] members of the Nascar Technology Partner Platform. Christine Stoffel-Moffet envisioned a different type of Nascar when she became the sport's head of enterprise technology a year ago.  She wanted the sport's partners, which already had a strong history of working together, to increase business-to-business relationships. But in order to do it, she wanted to come up with a unique program that no other sport offers. “I developed the idea from the company I had been running for the last seven years,” Stoffel-Moffet, who ran Sports & Entertainment Alliance in Technology (SEAT).  Stoffel-Moffet founded SEAT and served as its CEO until last year, when she had an opportunity she couldn’t turn down from Nascar. Her relationships with tech CEOs, plus the ones Nascar already developed, combined for a core proud of 30 brands that seldom had an opportunity to work together. So Stoffel-Moffet created a new Nascar-centered community for the tech industry called the Nascar Technology Partner Platform. To kick off the program, 28 technology companies attended the platform’s inaugural event at Daytona International Speedway during the Coke Zero Sugar 400 race weekend. “It revolves around how we can leverage technology in the industry moving forward,” she said. “It evolved organically from what I built in a global platform and, now, I’m bringing something unique to Nascar. “We were looking at different technologies and how to evolve our sport. We have to evolve the racing industry and take it to a whole new level of success.” Last year, during the Covid-19 lockdown and the months after, Nascar began the process of handpicking brands that it believed could play a large role in the sport’s future.  Existing partners Comcast, Verizon and Amazon Web Services topped the list, but new companies like HGC Technologies and Extreme Networks were also identified as possible companies that could align with Nascar. “Our mission statement is to be looked upon as the most inspiring, future forward, innovative and technology-advanced organization across the sports-entertainment industry,” Stoffel-Moffet said. “The pandemic created opportunity if you look at the negative things in a positive way.” At Daytona, the 28 tech companies were joined by 11 sports entertainment organizations. The program enabled Nascar to share ideas and listen to new ones from its partners about topics like ticketing, expanding at-track wifi and more. Stoffel-Moffet’s team took the participants on a tour around Daytona, a 2.5-mile facility. They were shown what the elaborate fan experience is like at Nascar races, and it enabled them to quickly understand how each individual brand could play a part in Nascar’s future. “It was an explosive opporunity,” Stoffel-Moffet said. Nascar wants to create a community of sports entities with tech companies — both large and small — to bring the industry a new experience. The new program will help Nascar take more risks when it comes to developing new technology that different groups in the sport can use, whether it be teams, drivers, fans or television partners. “We want to bring people together so we can collaborate,” she said. “We want to move the needle for sports.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephwolkin/2021/09/09/nascar-forms-a-technology-partner-platform-to-prepare-for-the-future/,Nascar Forms A Technology Partner Platform To Prepare For The Future
"Dino Morea in a still from 'The Empire'. Indian actor Dino Morea started his Bollywood journey with the image of a lover boy in the 90s. He now returns as the antagonist of Disney+ Hotstar’s new epic saga, The Empire. The web series launched a week ago and Morea is being widely appreciated for his performance as Shaybani Khan on the show. In this interview, the Raaz star shares what attracts artists to negative roles.  Morea says, “The fact that there are no boundaries (attracts artists to negative roles). There are no limitations that one needs to follow as an actor. When playing a good guy, you have to be a certain way but while doing bad guy’s character, you can do the craziest of things and people will still believe you. It is the best opportunity for any actor to showcase talent.” Asked if he ever anticipated he’d get this kind of a response for his performance in The Empire, Morea says, “No, I just worked really hard and I did not think what the feedback was going to be, while working on show. This overwhelming feedback is just outstanding, I knew people were going to appreciate it but the feedback is tremendous. I am eternally grateful.” Talking about getting the opportunity of playing the antagonist in The Empire, Morea adds, “Mitakshara Kumar and Nikkhil Advani saw me as Shaybani khan and I jumped at the opportunity. I must thank them both for seeing me this way and taking the chance with me. The director, producer, everyone was willing to take that risk of casting me in a negative role.” Created by Nikkhil Advani, The Empire stars Kunal Kapoor as Babar while Shabana Azmi plays his grandmother Aisan Daulat Begum.

"Gamers play the League of Legends video game during the Douyu Festival 2019 in Wuhan, China, on ... [+] Saturday, June 15, 2019.  Chinese regulators summoned Tencent and NetEase on Wednesday, telling them to resolutely enforce the government’s latest minor-protection rules and overhaul potential addictive gameplay. Shares of both companies plunged more than 8%.  Government agencies including the nation’s propaganda department, The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee, and the National Press and Publication Administration called for the meeting. Regulators emphasized to the gaming companies that they must limit minor’s playing time to three hours a week as previously required, ban illegal content that includes obscenity, violence and money-worship, as well as overhaul any game play that could lead to addiction, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  The gaming companies should also proactively resist unfair competition, and shift the focus of their businesses to technology innovation, Xinhua wrote. The regulators vowed to strengthen checks and carry out unspecified but “harsh punishments.” NetEase, which saw its shares plunge as much as 11% in Hong Kong a day after the meeting, says the company will strictly follow the rules and instructions over anti-addiction measures. “We will continue our efforts to deliver more quality games and promote a healthy and responsible gaming environment for minor players, as we seek to build and promote a wholesome gaming environment in China,” a company spokesperson says in a statement sent to Forbes.  A Tencent spokesperson also vows compliance. “We believe in healthy game play and take very seriously the physical and mental health of minors,” the company says in its statement sent to Forbes. “We appreciate the guidance and instruction from the relevant regulators, and will work hard to be in full compliance with all rules relating to youth game addiction and content regulation."" Still, the company plunged 8.5% in Hong Kong, after gaining about 16% since Aug 30, when China announced the three-hour per week curb on minor’s playing time. Tencent has been buying back its shares since it announced second-quarter results on Aug. 18, and investors looking for  bargains have also piled into what they believed to be oversold shares.  The government, in the meantime, highlighted in the meeting other areas that the companies need to work on. As the nation seeks to make children tougher and young boys more masculine, gaming companies must avoid effeminacy and strictly regulate celebrity endorsement. “The online gaming companies… should enhance their political stance, strengthen their responsibilities, and profoundly understand the importance and urgency of minor’s anti-addiction protection efforts,” Xinhua wrote. “[They should] resolutely carry out the relevant requirements and indeed protect minors’ mental and physical health.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2021/09/09/china-tells-tencent-netease-to-overhaul-gameplay-and-curb-in-game-spending/,"China Tells Tencent, NetEase To Overhaul Gameplay And Curb In-Game Spending"
"A homemade spice rub and barbecue sauce create layers of flavor on chicken pieces and Portobello ... [+] mushroom caps for barbecue chicken that is next level. Barbecue chicken is universally loved and also not considered “serious BBQ” by grilling and barbecue aficionados. I think that is because the barbecue part has more to do with a sweet red [bottled] sauce than real barbecue. The barbecue chicken that most of us grew up on was made by slathering chicken pieces with that thick sugary sauce generally scented with liquid smoke and purchased at the grocery store. Often times, this barbecue chicken was made in a 9 x 13 glass casserole pan. The entire bottle of sauce was poured on the raw chicken and it was often baked in the oven. It wasn’t bad and made the house smell good with the vinegary scent of cooking BBQ sauce but it’s not really “barbecue chicken.” It's no wonder that the most common grilling mistake is to cook chicken over direct heat and start the chicken slathered in sweet barbecue sauce. This results in chicken that is burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Anyone who grills a lot knows that bone-in chicken pieces need to be cooked by the indirect method and that you only put a sweet barbecue sauce—that has a propensity to burn—on during the final 10 minutes of the cooking time.  It had been a long time since I had made barbecue chicken. But I was experimenting with a homemade barbecue sauce and I wanted to see how my Spark grill would cook chicken pieces. Since I made a homemade spice rub to flavor my homemade barbecue sauce, I used it instead of using salt and pepper to season my chicken. This decision instantly created layers of flavor—one from the rub and one from the cooked-on sauce at the end.  This is a common technique for making ribs and other barbecued meats, but since most people use a bottled sauce for chicken, it is not as common. I grilled the chicken pieces for about 20 minutes and then added Portobello mushroom caps to the cooking grate that were also seasoned with the barbecue rub. These were “barbecue” for my vegetarian friends, but if you love mushrooms, you should make them as a side to the chicken because they are as good as the chicken! The Spark grill employs a heat spreader that deflects the direct heat which means that it is designed to cook using indirect heat. This design feature makes it very easy to cook chicken pieces the right way as there is no need to configure the burners or charcoal to create indirect heat.  After about 35 minutes, I could see that the rub was creating a really beautiful crisp crust on the top of the chicken pieces before I even sauced them. At this point, it was about seven minutes before the chicken was done and I liberally sauced the chicken pieces with my homemade Sweet and Sassy Bourbon BBQ Sauce. I closed the lid of the grill and let the barbecue sauce set and glaze the chicken as it finished cooking.  When I took the chicken off the grill to let it rest, I could immediately tell that the skin was crisper and had more texture than when I make barbecue chicken with salt and pepper and then slather it with sauce. But taking a bite of it was when I was really convinced that layering the flavors and the textures is how to make next level barbecue chicken. The first layer of flavor on the Barbecue Chicken and the Barbecue Portobello Mushrooms is the Sweet ... [+] and Sassy Spice Rub. This sauce (and the companion Sweet and Sassy Spice Rub) makes next level barbecued chicken. It is also great on ribs, pork and hearty fish like salmon and catfish as well as Portobello mushrooms, charred onions and slabs of grilled potatoes! Make barbecued Portobello mushrooms at the same time as the chicken for the veggie lovers in your life. Makes about 6 cups  1          28 oz. can crushed tomatoes  1         cup firmly packed brown sugar  2         tablespoons molasses  1⁄2      cup favorite Bourbon 1⁄2      cup Heinz Ketchup  1⁄4        cup Heinz Chili Sauce (not sriracha)  1⁄4      cup apple-cider vinegar  1/8      cup red wine vinegar 1⁄4       cup of Worcestershire sauce 2          teaspoons Sweet and Sassy Spice Rub (below)  1          tablespoon unsweetened cocoa   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste In a large saucepan on the stove, add tomatoes, sugar, molasses, Bourbon, ketchup, chili sauce, vinegars, and Worcestershire sauce, stirring after each additional ingredient to combine. Add the Classic Spice Rub and simmer until flavors have blended and sauce has thickened somewhat, about 30 minutes.  Let the sauce cool for about 10 minutes or until it is warm but no longer ""boiling"" hot. Puree using an immersion or traditional blender. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, and freshly ground pepper. Remember, the meat will have plenty of spice rub on them, so don't over-season the sauce. Add the cocoa powder and mix well to combine. Let sit 5 minutes and stir again to make sure cocoa powder is well distributed. Let cool and pour into a clean glass jar for storing. The sauce can be made in advance and kept for 2 weeks in the refrigerator.  Sweet and Sassy Spice Rub Makes about 1 cup 1⁄4       cup dark brown sugar 1          tablespoon sweet paprika 1          tablespoon smoked Spanish paprika 1          tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 11/2    tablespoons kosher salt 2          teaspoons garlic powder 2          teaspoons onion powder 1⁄2       teaspoon cayenne pepper  Combine sugar, paprika, peppers, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne in a medium-size bowl and mix well.  Extra rub can be stored in an airtight container for up to six months.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethkarmel/2021/09/09/how-to-make-next-level-barbecue-chicken/,How To Make Next Level Barbecue Chicken
"The city of Los Angeles could get as much as $17.9 billion from a long term lease of Los Angeles ... [+] International Airport (show here) to an airport management company. That's according to a new study from The Reason Foundation. After paying off the airport's bonded indebtedness the city could net about $10.6 billion from the deal, money that could be used to finance other capital-intensive off-airport infrastructure projects or cover any unfunded pension liabilities or other debts the city has. And Reason's study openly admits its value estimates for LAX and 30 other airports around the nation likely are low. SAM LaFOCA/Getty Images More than two dozen local governments around the nation are sitting atop gold mines worth an estimated $131 billion – money they could use to bail out underfunded employee pension plans, prop-up convention and tourism businesses that have been brought low by the pandemic, or to build new existing city infrastructure like roads and parks or improve them. A recent study from the libertarian Reason Foundation suggests cities, counties, regional transportation authorities or state governments that own mid-size and large airports in the United States could access huge amounts of cash by leasing those airports to private airport operations companies. The legal process, Reason’s study said, would follow the same formula used when those same government entities do long-term privatization deals with businesses that then charge tolls to pay down the debt they typically take on to fund the big up-front lease fees they usually pay out, while also earning significant profits. It’s a method of allowing local or state governments to turn their substantial investments in critical infrastructure, often made over multiple decades, into cash that they can use to pay for other initiatives. In some cases such deals allow cities, regional or state governments to construct entirely new infrastructure, like freeways, they could not otherwise afford to build. Until recently it was against the law for local governments to strike these sorts of privatization deals involving airports. Because all publicly owned airports in the U.S. receive at least some federal airport development grants, they historically have had to abide by federal funding rules that say local government owners of airports can’t divert any cash they get from those airports to projects or for purposes not directly tied to them. But in 2018 Congress authorized the Airport Investment Partnership Program, which allows local government entities that own airports to use the proceeds from certain types of long-term leases on those airports for other government purposes. The only big limitation: governments first must pay off any existing bond debt against their airports before using any remaining lease proceeds for off-airport purposes. In most cases, city governments – which typically are the owners of major commercial airports in this country – would still come away from an airport leasing deal with billions of dollars in cash, even after paying off their airport’s bonded debt. Still, even after paying off any bond debt backed by airport facilities, most cities or other government entities that lease their airports to operating companies would reap a bonanza of cash that they otherwise could never access. And make no mistake, the amounts of cash local governments could tap are enormous: The Reason Foundation estimates that $131 billion could be unlocked by leasing out just 31 large and medium-sized U.S. airports that its study evaluated.  For example, leasing out Los Angeles International Airport could raise $17.8 billion for its owner, the city of Los Angeles. San Francisco International Airport, which is owned jointly by the city and county of San Francisco, could fetch $11.9 billion in a lease deal, according to the Reason study. Leasing out Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, jointly owned by those two cities, could bring them $11.9 billion in cash, while doing the same with Hartsfield-Jackson Airport could yield $9.2 billion for the City of Atlanta. Alternatively, local governments that own airports could choose to cut deals leasing only a portion of their airports to operating companies by partnering with an airport management company to create a jointly owned public-private partnership that would serve as the airport’s operator. The city or other local government could retain say, a 40% stake in the partnership. That would produce less cash for immediate use elsewhere in its jurisdiction, but it would retain greater control over how their airports are managed and developed and/or greater financial flexibility that could be useful should that government entity need to raise more cash later on. To be sure, Robert Poole, the study’s author and the Reason Foundation’s co-founder and transportation policy director, cautions local government against looking at airport leasing deals as a quick way to score short-term political points with constituents. The “proceeds from the lease of a major infrastructure asset such as an airport should be used to strengthen the jurisdiction’s balance sheet, rather than using such a windfall for short-term operating budget needs,” he wrote.  But he also listed three areas where money raised by leasing an airport to an operating company could be put to wise use by city or other local governments:   “The relative attractiveness of using lease proceeds for each of these purposes will likely depend on the specifics of the city, county, or state in question,” Poole wrote. “A government with a pressing need for a major unfunded infrastructure facility may find that use the most attractive, while a jurisdiction where unfunded pension liabilities threaten either large tax increases or something akin to bankruptcy may prefer using an airport windfall to shore up its pension system.” In fact, the Reason study found several U.S. jurisdictions where the proceeds from leasing out the airport in a Public-Private Partnership deal would produce more than enough cash to cover those jurisdictions’ unfunded pension liabilities. It found other cases where such proceeds “could significantly reduce those liabilities.” But it also found several jurisdictions in its study where the proceeds from leasing the airport to an operating company would not produce enough cash to have more than modest impact on the jurisdiction’s extra large pension liability.  Poole also noted that his estimated combined value of $131 billion in lease value from 31 airports is, by his own assessment, a conservative estimate. Thus, it’s possible that some or all of the 31 airports he looked at could generate even larger amounts of cash for the jurisdictions that own them. Indeed, the study’s valuations of the various airports it looked at assumed that each airport’s value is 20 times more than its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, which is a widely used measure of annual cash flow. However, earlier this summer Sidney International Airport, Australia’s largest, got a $17 billion lease offer that placed a value on the airport of 26 times that its EBITDA. Yet, Sidney officials rejected that offer because, in their view, it undervalued the airport. That suggests that Poole’s valuations of those 31 U.S. airports could be significantly below their actual market values. And that potentially means that the combined value of those 31 U.S. airports included in the Reason study is significantly greater than the $131 billion at which the study pegged them.  Skytrax, a British aviation consulting company, notes that 11 of what it considers the top 25 airports in the world are privatized, most of them via leasing arrangements like those advocated by the Reason study. The Reason Study further suggests that privatization of airports through such long-term lease arrangements could also help elevate the level of service at U.S. airports. Such deals, the study suggests, would allow those airport management companies to invest in new facilities and services at airports more quickly and nimbly than government bodies could make such investments. And under private (leased) ownership/operation arrangements, U.S. airports could migrate more quickly from their current heavy dependence on charges and fees paid by airlines to a revenue production model more dependent on non-aviation airport users, retail concessions, parking, rental cars, and other non-airline sources of airport revenue. Doing that would lower the barrier for airlines to enter airports they don’t currently service or for expansion of services at airports where they currently have a small presence.  Already several airlines have spoken in support of recent proposals from private airport operating companies to lease airports in Chicago, St. Louis and Westchester County, N.Y. In keeping with the Reason Foundation’s long-standing advocacy for Public-Private Partnerships for building, growing and operating capital-intensive infrastructure like highways and airports, Pool encourage U.S. cities, regions or states to seriously consider such leasing deals. Such arrangements are becoming increasingly common, he noted, in Europe, Australia and Latin American.  Currently 75% of air travelers in Europe, and 66% of those in Latin America use airports that are operated by airport management companies rather than being directly operated by government bodies. In most of those cases cities or other government bodies have retained at least a small percentage stake in the special purpose companies they formed in partnership with a professional airport management firm. Such Public-Private Partnership arrangements often carry special tax and capital financing advantages for which purely private airport management firms often can’t qualify. Currently, the United States has the smallest amount of participation in such arrangements of any economically advanced nation in the world, with the only leasing deal at an airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory in the Caribbean.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielreed/2021/09/09/us-cities-for-the-first-time-could-turn-their-billions-invested-in--airports-into-cash-for-other-projects/,U.S. Cities For The First Time Could Turn Billions Invested In Airports Into Cash For Other Projects
"Burger King has recruited three celebrities–Nelly, Lil Huddy and Anitta–to promote the removal of ... [+] 120 artificial ingredients from its menu. Those celebrities' favorite meals are part of a new ""Keep It Real"" campaign, featuring their real names.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and so like many of its competitors, Burger King has recruited a few celebrities to try and sell its products.  Nelly, Lil Huddy and Anitta have signed on for the chain’s new Keep It Real meals, promoting its move to ban 120 artificial ingredients as part of a broader commitment to “deliver real food.” Among those ingredients are artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from artificial sources. The marketing hook here is that the meals will feature the celebrities’ real names to coincide with the brand’s “real ingredients” journey. The meals include:     The Keep It Real meals are available starting Sept. 12 for a special price of $6 for the chain’s Royal Perks members. With this promotion, Burger King hopes to drive more customers into its loyalty program–launched nationwide just a week ago. Loyalty programs have become table stakes in the restaurant space, as they attract an increasingly digital consumer set looking for exclusive and personalized offers, and those consumers tend to spend more.  Celebrity meals have also seemed to become quite critical. Such meals have provided a material sales lift for McDonald’s 
  
  MCD 
 , for example; Bank of America 
  
  BAC 
  raised its estimates for McDonald’s following the wild success of its Travis Scott promotion, and restaurant visits were up 12% after launching its BTS promotion. Dunkin’ got a sales boost from TikTok star Charli D’Amelio’s signature drink, and Jack in the Box 
  
  JACK 
  jumped into the virtual restaurant space with the help of singer/songwriter Jason Derulo, while Wendy’s 
  
  WEN 
  hired popular Twitch streamers to promote a recent delivery-only campaign.  Burger King wants to tap some of this potential. It perhaps needs to tap some of this potential, as the chain has fallen further behind McDonald’s throughout the pandemic and recently gave up its No. 2 spot in the burger category to Wendy’s.  The brand has pulled all the stops to avoid any further sliding–unveiling a new “restaurant of tomorrow” design, jumping into the intensifying loyalty space, throwing its crown in the chicken sandwich ring with a differentiated (hand-breaded) product and rolling out its first rebrand in more than 20 years.  Today’s news is part of that comprehensive rebrand, which former President Chris Finazzo called “the new Burger King food journey.” It also piggybacks off the chain’s announcement one year ago that its signature Whopper was officially free of colors, flavors and preservatives from artificial sources. That announcement was supported by a bold ad featuring a moldy Whopper, which certainly got people talking. By leveraging celebrities, Burger King could get more people talking–at the very least fans of those three celebrities. It also shows the brand is very clearly taking a page from its competitors’ playbook. And why wouldn’t it? Those competitors have had tremendous success with their respective celebrity campaigns.   The difference here is Burger King is cleverly focusing on their real identities to shift the focus back to that “real ingredients” journey. Therein lies an important differentiator for the brand. The Keep It Real Meals aren’t about the celebrities at all, but about ingredient lists consumers increasingly pay attention to. In fact, a recent report from the International Food Information Council found that 30% of consumers believe ingredients have a big influence on the food they purchase, and nearly two out of three consumers say that ingredients have at least a “moderate” influence.  “We know our guests’ expectations are changing, and they want to make choices they can feel good about,” CMO Ellie Doty said in a press release. “By banning these 120 ingredients from our food, we’re offering guests an easy choice–delicious food made with quality ingredients. We’re confident that our ongoing commitment to real food will not only provide guests with the food they’re looking for, but also set a standard for the industry overall.” If that’s indeed the case, we may start seeing artificial ingredients banned from other chains just as much as we’ve seen celebrity meals of late. However, some have already moved toward such a goal. In 2018, McDonald’s announced it removed artificial ingredients from its seven classic burgers. Wendy’s has used fresh beef since its inception. Several other chains have also cut artificial ingredients from their menus, including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Chipotle and Panera

  veteran thinks about the buzz over his former employer’s well-publicized advance driver assistance system (ADAS), he smiles and says that semi-autonomous feature is “just a start,” and when he despairs over the almost 40,000 traffic deaths each year in the U.S. he thinks about preventing them in clinical terms.  Brian Latouf, Chief Safety Officer, Hyundai Motor North America.  “It's almost like the medical field. You're trying to solve a problem or disease or some sort of health threat and from that we look at the types of frontal, side, rear crashes that happen, roll over crashes,” said LaTouf during a wide-ranging conversation this week.  Indeed, since joining Hyundai as CSO in November, 2019, Latouf has been focused on building on the automaker's growing safety reputation bolstered by 11 Hyundai and 4 Genesis 2020 and 2021 models being awarded top safety pick designations by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  Chart shows Hyundai/Genesis rankings versus competitors in latest Insurance Institute for Highway ... [+] Safety crash tests.  To maintain and improve that standing Latouf says the company takes a research-based approach to safety by examining real world data and anecdotal input before deciding what types of technology is necessary to avoid collisions and other calamities.  “We look at not so much content components and parts, we look at safety hazards to ensure quality and performance but we also look at injury and crash causation,” said Latouf.  The company also considers letters and emails from customers and has a program called Speak Up For Safety which encourages employees at its North American assembly plants to give their input on its vehicles.  “If you have an issue with your car tells us about it, speak up and we're going to look at it. We're going to consider it. It's important for us to get that feedback,” Latouf said. He notes a particular safety concern right now is what he termed a “significant” increase in collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists. The trend presents the challenge of creating and installing the right complement of sensors and technology to detect who he described as “vulnerable road users.”  2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric crossover vehicle.  As Hyundai dives further into the battery electric vehicle segment Latouf notes the industry as a whole is still learning about the different engineering challenges they present, especially as they pertain to high voltage batteries that can catch fire under certain circumstances. For his company that concern has led to specific actions.  “We manage careful quality considerations in the construction of the cells, how they come into the modules and then are put into the assemblies. We also have battery management software, (BMS), that carefully monitors at the cell level voltage drop across each and every cell. If there's a variation of a certain amount of voltage we'll actively flag that as a diagnostic trouble code and we can also shut the battery from being recharged again if we feel one of the cells is not in a good state and needs servicing,” explained Latouf. “We also have temperature sensors that can look for sudden heat fluxes in case there's a potential fire occurring in which case you can isolate the battery.”  Preventing heat-related injuries and death to children and pets left in the back seat has also led to a key Hyundai safety initiative through technology. Two levels of Hyundai's Rear Occupant Alert system let drivers know if a child or pet is still in the back seat after the vehicle is parked. The door-logic system detects if a rear door was opened or closed before the car was started, then reminds the driver to check the rear seat with a message on the center cluster when exiting the vehicle. Currently available on the 2020 Santa Fe and Palisade the company said it will make the feature standard on most of its vehicles by next year. The Ultrasonic version adds an ultrasonic sensor that helps to detect the movements of children and pets in the second-row seats. If the system detects movement in the second-row seats after the driver leaves the vehicle and locks the doors, it will honk the horn and send an alert to the driver’s smartphone via Hyundai’s Blue Link connected car system, if the vehicle is equipped with Blue Link and it's active.  Right now Ultrasonic Rear Occupant Alert is available as an option on selected vehicles but Latouf said expanding its availability may be considered, explaining “We're looking at that. How effective is it, do customers appreciate it, is it doing what it needs to be doing.”  Hyundai's Highway Driver Assist (HDA) system is a combination safety and convenience feature. It helps to maintain a prescribed distance from the vehicle ahead when driving on a highway and helps center the vehicle in the lane while driving, including curves. It also can help maintain vehicle speeds according to posted speed limits on federal interstate highways. HDA is standard on model year 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Genesis G70, GV80, G80 and G90.  HDA2 goes several steps further including keeping the vehicle centered in the lane even around corners by controlling the steering wheel. It also actively responds to close-range low-speed cut-ins by other drivers and will automatically assist lane changes in certain conditions when the driver activates the turn signal.  HDA2 is optional on Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Genesis GV70 and standard on Genesis G80/GV80. Unlike Cadillac's Super Cruise driver assist system, neither HDA or HDA2 is designed to allow hands free driving for an extended amount of time. The company recommends not taking the hands of the wheel for more than 30 seconds to a minute depending on conditions.  “I think the next step is we're starting to introduce driver monitoring,” said Latouf. “I think the next step after that, as the driver becomes incapacitated, say, or drowsy, how does the vehicle intervene and safely manage the vehicle to avoid a crash.”   Latouf says, as “smart” as vehicles are today it's still early days in terms of how much smarter they can become, especially as it pertains to safety. What's next? “The vehicle saving lives on its own,” Latouf declares. “As we learn more from the automated vehicle world with all the different sensors, sensor fusion, software, perception, object event detection response (OEDR) we can do more for the customer.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/09/09/hyundai-safety-chief-talks-battery-fires-reducing-traffic-deaths-smarter-vehicles/,"Hyundai Safety Chief Talks Battery Fires, Reducing Traffic Deaths, Smarter Vehicles"

"Halfords, like the rest of the bike business, is struggling to get parts in a supply chain crunch. ... [+] (Photo by: Newscast/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Halfords, the U.K.’s biggest bikes retailer, has become the latest top name cycling business to report a hit to sales from supply chain disruption, in a crisis that is threatening to derail both the U.S. and European cycling industries. The bikes-to-auto parts and servicing retailer said same-store cycling sales were down by almost 23% in the 20 weeks to August 20 compared with the same period last year and warned its struggles may take time to overcome. Halfords said that while the figure reflected tough comps as demand for bikes for exercise skyrocketed at the start of the COVID crisis, the global distribution problems accelerated towards the end of the trading period. The retailer, which has 404 stores, said availability of adult bikes is particularly low as the industry “continues to experience considerable capacity constraints”. The problems facing the U.K.'s largest cycling retailer include factory production constraints, raw material inflation and freight disruption, compounded by a labor shortage, particularly with the U.K. facing a shortfall of 100,000 truck drivers alone. Despite this, the company said that it had continued to benefit from the surge in ‘staycations’ (vacationing in the U.K. rather than travelling abroad) and as a result stuck to its full-year pre-tax profit target to come in above $103 million. Chief executive Graham Stapleton said: ""The first 20 weeks of the financial year 2021-22 delivered a strong trading performance against a hugely challenging backdrop. Although our cycling business is currently impacted by the considerable disruption in the global supply chain, as the U.K.'s largest cycling retailer we are well positioned to adapt, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for the cycling market."" Halfords is far from alone in facing these challenges. Some of the world’s biggest bicycle makers are considering revamping their supply chains because of repeated delays to parts deliveries, described by several manufacturers as the longest in decades. Production was initially disrupted as Asian factories temporarily closed at the start of the COVID crisis but as recently as June of this year Malaysia imposed a two-week lockdown on manufacturers to cope with the latest surge, hitting some bike part manufacturers. So the problem just won’t go away. “Making the bike frames isn’t a problem,” Peter Lazarus, cycling market leader at Decathlon, told a U.K. cycling publication. “Decathlon certainly has no problems producing its own bike frames. It’s the componentry that’s causing the issue, particularly the headline componentry: groupset, wheels, saddles, handlebars.” Japanese high-end manufacturer Shimano is at the centre of parts shortages. (Photo by Luc ... [+] Claessen/Getty Images) Aside from the component companies getting back up to speed, they in turn are reliant on raw materials suppliers, which have also been disrupted. With many bike components made up of parts from various sources, if even just one of those sources can’t supply the relevant part the component can’t be finished or shipped. So the need for a small part can ultimately delay an entire bike. On top of all that, there is a shipping container crisis. Where once the containers were stuck in Chinese ports, now, because China exports far more to the U.S. and Europe than goes in the opposite direction, containers have been stuck in the West when they are needed in Asia.  A surge in demand sent the price as high as $18,000 for containers originally priced at around $2,000. And it’s not just the shipping of finished bikes from Asia to Europe and the U.S. that’s affected, it’s the movement of raw materials to component manufacturers, and of components to bike assembly plants too.  The situation has also highlighted over-reliance for components on Japan’s Shimano, which controls an estimated 65% of the market for high-end gears and brakes. European and U.S. producers have reported lead times of up to 400 days for a range of high-end components made by Osaka-based Shimano, while some suppliers reported even longer lead times for certain elements such as hydraulic brakes or wheels. The supply chain squeeze has hit leading bicycle makers such as Taiwan’s Giant and Merida. Shimano, which produces fishing components and rowing equipment as well as bicycle parts, has struggled to keep up with demand and shortages are expected to persist, even with Shimano plants operating at full capacity. The frustration for the bike business is that cycling has never been more popular and yet just as cyclists yearn to get out on the open road, the industry is struggling to keep its wheels turning.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2021/09/09/wheels-risk-coming-off-as-booming-bike-industry-cant-keep-up/,Wheels Risk Coming Off As Booming Bike Industry Can’t Keep Up

One of the game’s greatest ever players was coming back to Old Trafford in what everyone hopes will be a fairy tale ending to his incredible career.  But there was one exception: the Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek.  ""Cristiano arrived on Friday which we knew was bad news for us,"" Van de Beek’s agent Guido Albers said this week. ""[Paul] Pogba plays on the left, and with Cristiano’s arrival it means another extra player in midfield, with Pogba moving away from the left.”  Footballers want to play with the best players, but above all else they simply want to play, and Van de Beek and his agent both did the maths and knew Ronaldo’s arrival could further limit the amount of time he spends on the pitch.  Van de Beek was already at the back of a long queue before Ronaldo’s arrival saw him shuffle even further back.

[+] match between Ajax v Feyenoord at the Johan Cruijff Arena on January 21, 2018 in Amsterdam (Photo by Laurens Lindhout/Soccrates/Getty Images) Since his arrival from Ajax for £35 million in the summer of 2020 Van de Beek has made 36 appearances, but it is a misleading statistic, that hides his isolation.  In the Premier League Van de Beek has started a mere four games, making an additional 15 appearances as a substitute, while suffering the indignity of being an unused substitute on 15 occasions.  The evidence could not be more clear that the United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not trust Van de Beek, which has raised inevitable questions about why United invested so much money in him last summer.  United were expected to acknowledge their mistake and sell him this summer, especially as there was strong interest from all over Europe.  Towards the end of the window Everton entered in to talks with Van de Beek and his agent and were close to agreeing a deal, before being told by Solskjaer himself that United were not interested in letting him go.  ""I speak with the manager about it and the club,” Van de Beek said this week. “They were clear they wanted me to stay here. The manager was really positive about me and he said, 'I need you and I want to keep you here'. MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JULY 26: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Donny van de ...

(Photo by Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images) ""The way the conversation went this time [with Solskjaer] compared to last summer... things are much more clear now,” Albers has added. “I have full expectations that Donny will get his chance now.”  And yet three Premier League games in to the new season this promised chance has not arrived. It has been the same old story with Van de Beek being an unused substitute against Leeds, Southampton and Wolves.  ""Of course, what I see here now in the beginning of the season is difficult because I didn't play one minute,” Van de Beek has acknowledged. “But [Solskjaer] said, 'What I see every day in training, I see a different Donny now' I need to trust him. If he doesn’t need me, I think he will let me go. I think he has plans for me.”  Solskjaer’s plan for Van de Beek remains shrouded in mystery, and is further undermined by confusion about his best position.  With Bruno Fernandes at United there will never be any opening for him to play as an attacking Number 10.  And just this week the Dutch legend and former Netherlands manager Marco van Basten was scathing about his quality in that position.

(Photo by Philipp Schmidli/Getty Images) ""It just wasn’t smart choices,” he said. “If you say you spoke to Real Madrid and then you go to Manchester United, you are betting way too high. Van de Beek is not that good.”  ""As number 10 at Ajax it is much easier than as number 10 in Spain or England. In the Netherlands you get a lot of help, you get opportunities, but that is not the case abroad.”  Van de Beek’s best opportunity to impress would be in United’s central midfield partnership, but Solskjaer has shown little inclination to play him there, doubting his defensive abilities, and preferring Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba.  But Van de Beek is still hopeful he can find a place in Solskjaer’s team. “For how we play, I think the best position for me is a number six or eight,” he said this week.  The history of the Premier League is littered with stories of players moving from abroad, starting slowing, but then flourishing in their second season, and Van de Beek hopes to become another one.  This campaign might not have started well for him, but with fellow midfielder Scott McTominay currently injured, there could be a chance for the Dutchman to now learn more about Solskjaer’s plan for him.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sampilger/2021/09/09/will-donny-van-de-beek-be-given-a-genuine-chance-at-manchester-united/,Will Donny van de Beek Be Given A Genuine Chance At Manchester United?

"Taliban authorities have agreed to allow 200 U.S. civilians and several other foreign nationals still in Afghanistan to leave the country, according to Reuters, one week after U.S. troops and government officials completed their evacuation operation from the country. A Taliban soldier stands guard as passengers disembark on arrival from Kandahar, at Hamid Karzai ... [+] International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The American citizens and other foreign nationals are set to leave Afghanistan sometime on Thursday on a Qatar Airways flight, the Wall Street Journal reported citing Qatari and American officials. The outbound international flight,  a Qatar Airways Boeing 777, will reportedly mark the resumption of international passenger flights from Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport and will be followed by daily flights abroad, the report adds. Qatari officials have clarified that the outbound flight is not an “evacuation flight” but rather a ticketed service facilitated by the middle eastern nation. The planned departure will the first international passenger flight to take off from Kabul airport since the U.S. military and its allies exited Afghanistan last month.  According to Reuters, the Taliban reportedly agreed to allow the departures after being pressed to do so by the U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad—who has been in charge of peace talks with the militant group. On Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas)—the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee—told Fox News that the Taliban was blocking half a dozen planes with American citizens, U.S. permanent residents and Afghan interpreters, from departing Afghanistan. McCaul suggested that the militant group was holding the flight hostage until Washington recognizes the Taliban government. According to the New York Times, the situation left around 1,000 people including several U.S. citizens and visa holders stuck in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. It is unclear if all the people stuck in the northern city—including Afghan nationals who hold U.S. visas— will be among the group of people being allowed to leave via Kabul. President Joe Biden and his administration have copped severe criticism from lawmakers in Washington for leaving several American citizens and Afghan allies behind. On Sunday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain told CNN that around 100 Americans remained stranded in Afghanistan, but he expressed hope that commercial flights out of the country would resume soon.

"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Wednesday listed Guillain-Barre Syndrome—a neurological disorder that can cause temporary paralysis—as a “very rare” side effect of the AstraZeneca Covid-19, a move that comes just weeks after the nerve disorder was listed as a possible side effect for another adenovirus-based vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson. Only 833 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome have been reported worldwide from about 592 million ... [+] administered doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In an update published on Wednesday, EMA said a causal relationship between the adenovirus-based vaccine and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was “considered at least a reasonable possibility.” The agency said therefore the condition should be added to the product information as a side effect of the vaccine. The EMA also recommended a warning should be added to inform the vaccine’s recipients to seek medical attention if they develop weakness and paralysis in the extremities that can progress to the chest and face. The incidence of the side effect remains extremely rare, with only 833 cases reported worldwide from about 592 million administered doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as of July 25. GBS is a disorder where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, causing temporary paralysis and breathing difficulties and it has been reported in several patients who have been infected with Covid-19. In July, the drug regulator listed GBS as a “very rare” side effect of the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine, which is built on the same adenovirus technology as the AstraZeneca shot. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also issued a warning in July of an increased risk of developing the neurological disorder with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But both agencies noted that the incidence of such cases was extremely rare and the benefits of the vaccines still outweighed the risks. A study published last month in the British Medical Journal showed that people infected with Covid-19 faced a much greater risk of developing dangerous blood clots—another rare vaccine side effect—compared to people who have received a Pfizer or AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine.

Chunbo expects to make 250 billion won ($214 million) in revenue this year, with its batteries business contributing about 70% of group revenue. In early 2019, Chunbo listed on Korea’s technology-rich Kosdaq stock exchange, raising 100 billion won (about $86 million) to expand production capacity and for further research and development. In the same year, the company made Forbes Asia’s Best Under A Billion, an annual list that highlights 200 high-performing small and medium-sized listed companies in the Asia-Pacific region. Before starting Chunbo, Lee was head of development at cleaning-supplies maker Hanvit Chemical and worked at a laboratory of Dong Yang Chemical, now called OCI. He holds a master's degree in chemical engineering from Seoul's Hanyang University and a bachelor's degree from Seoul National University of Science & Technology.

"This is the first time Mondelez has featured a “zero waste” retail design in travel retail.  Mondelez has put sustainable cocoa in the spotlight in the travel-retail channel using an activation at Oslo Airport in partnership with Travel Retail Norway, in which duty-free company Heinemann has joint ownership.  Called Cocoa Life, the multi-brand promotion—developed by the World Travel Retail division of the confectionery giant—is also the first to features a “zero waste” retail design. It uses displays of natural wood made entirely of wood off-cuts from other units, with living plants “woven in” to emphasize the sustainability story.  The Oreo brand owner, with a turnover of $26 billion in 2019, is not featuring the U.S. bestselling cookie as part of the activation, focusing instead on popular Nordic chocolate brands like Daim, Freia and ubiquitous triangular airport favorite Toblerone.  The Cocoa Life program tackles the causes of what Mondelez International describes as “complex challenges” that cocoa farmers and their communities face, including climate change, gender inequality, poverty and child labor. The travel retail division claims that 99% of its chocolate portfolio now uses cocoa that is sustainably sourced through the program, with the ambition of achieving 100% by 2025. Iris Litschauer, senior business development manager at Mondelez WTR, said in a statement: “Using sustainable solutions for cocoa production benefits farming communities and the environment. We’re proud to debut the concept with Gebr. Heinemann and Travel Retail Norway.” At Travel Retail Norway, category manager Frank Hansen pointed out that sustainability continues to grow in importance in the Nordics, where confectionery is also heavily consumed. “The travel retail industry has a duty to both our consumers and the planet to offer products with ingredients that are sustainably sourced as well as to reduce our environmental footprint wherever possible,” he said. “Hopefully this activation will inspire more sustainable practices in the channel.”  Th ubiquitous Toblerone gets the green treatment.  Jens Peter Peuckert, marketing director at Gebr. Heinemann, added: “We believe that sustainable products and services will be the drivers of economic growth in travel retail. This activation in Oslo engages travelers at the intersection between sustainable design and products with sustainably-sourced ingredients. It is a perfect example of how people, planet and profit go hand in hand.” On Tuesday, Heinemann also outlined wider development goals by issuing its third UN Global Compact (UNGC) progress report. The UNGC primarily deals with corporate governance and principles based on human rights, labour standards, the environment and corruption prevention.  Max Heinemann: “We are aware of our influence and our responsibility as a company, and therefore ... [+] also of our role-model function.” “We see our UNGC reporting as an opportunity to regularly review, document and optimize the social and ecological consequences and interactions of our economic activities,” said Heinemann CEO Max Heinemann, who represents the fifth generation of owners. “We are aware of our influence and our responsibility as a company, and therefore also of our role-model function.” In the reporting period from August 2020 to August 2021 some of the achievements/actions were as follows:   Max Heinemann commented: “We derive our focus topics from the areas where we have the strongest impact and thus the strongest leverage with our business model. To implement them, we will cooperate with all partners in our value chain.” As such the company will be working towards wider goals by 2030 including the generation of more than half of sales through sustainable products and with responsible suppliers; being carbon-neutral primarily through reduced energy consumption; and implementing waste reduction, circular economy, and recycling measures in all parts of the value chain. The upshot is that the company has defined a clear path forward on sustainability that will impact its partners. An example is the Tony’s chocolate brand opening at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport where Heinemann had a key role. In taking this lead, brands and suppliers will need to adapt their practices to keep pace with the retailer. Expect, therefore, to see more ethical and/or sustainable promotions like the one in Oslo popping up across European airports in the first instance, and then further afield.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinrozario/2021/09/08/oreo-owner-mondelez-plays-sustainability-card-with-heinemann-in-norway/,Oreo Owner Mondelez Plays Sustainability Card With Heinemann In Norway
"Children's beach toys - buckets, spade and shovel on sand on a sunny day “If you find yourself in a hole - stop digging” say the experts.  “But, what if you can’t?” say the retailers.  “Hmmm – what’s next?” say the economists. Well, to be honest, if retail couldn’t rely on China right now, our consumer led economy would be in a whole lot of trouble. Unfortunately, Vietnam has become hamstrung by COVID - just as Holiday shipping has arrived. Consumer goods could become scarce this season, and prices are sure to rise. At the same time, inbound product from Asia is also impaired by a determined U.S. Government - targeting China at our ports of entry, and pushing new laws to interfere with commerce.  Pundits say that two-thirds of our USA GDP is related to consumer spending, but what if our retail shelves were barren in Q4 and beyond? What if the selling prices inflate through the roof? Are we pushing too hard against China? COVID’s Delta variant - plus an assortment of self inflicted trade wounds - have altered the importing of consumer goods. Last year China lowered export prices to offset former President Trump’s tariffs, and they also lowered prices to take market share from other production countries who were locked down with COVID. When the U.S. economy bounced back earlier this year, China raised prices - realizing that Trumpian tariffs were having little effect on demand and seeing their raw material costs rising; plus (to top it off) the Chinese Yuan (RMB) appreciated about 7% against the dollar.  Initially, former President Trump started his China trade war to manually alter the trade deficit and to slow down imports, but incoming President Biden decided to keep the tariffs in place, while U.S. Customs started to hold some China goods at the border. In addition to these serious issues, Congress neglected to renew the GSP program which significantly raised import costs (on goods that were not from China), while they were also getting ready to legislate even more stringent laws against China (related to the alleged forced labor in Xinjiang). During quarterly financial calls, analysts are pressing business leaders about their product diversification programs (away from China), but many companies have found it difficult to reach their own goals, especially with the GSP program not yet renewed. Some companies did relocate significant production to Vietnam (often considered a suburb of China), but with Vietnam’s COVID starting to spiral out of reasonable control, that has become a significant bump in the road headed into 2022. China has about 76% of their population vaccinated, but Vietnam is only at about 12% and this is bad for Vietnam and bad for the USA retail business. Those who left China for Vietnam (or for other assembly countries) are now in a significant bind. Using apparel sourcing as an example, USA retail fashion is 97% imported and 3% domestic. However, looking just at the import portion - China and Vietnam control the manufacturing base. Their combined share of the USA market (in SME) for the last three years has been:   With Vietnam now impaired and China running at capacity, there are few choices for fashion’s savvy sourcing teams - other than to raise prices and reduce delivery. At the end of the day, expect some trickle-down negative effect that will hit squarely on lofty retail projections for the Holiday selling season. To put this story in perspective; while discovery and re-assortment are ramping up in Asia, a little boy was sitting on the other side of the world attempting to dig a deep hole in the sand at Amagansett beach. With the summer ending, and the onshore winds kicking up, strollers stopped to ask if he needed help with his dig. In a defiant voice, the little boy proudly said that his mom told him that if he dug deep enough - he would reach China, and that was exactly what he intended to do. Funny, how we can pause for a moment to reflect on thoughts that remain the same over time, or others that can change in a heartbeat. It wasn’t so long ago when our parents told us about digging a hole to China. We dug in the beach, until we gave up or grew up, and that historical perspective begs for an answer - because if everyone always wanted to get to China, why is our government working so hard to turn us away? We understand that China wants Taiwan back, and everyone is concerned about navigational rights in the South China Sea. There is also the issue of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang - but these are political issues and why are they suddenly inter-connected with the business of commerce? Can’t political issues be settled at the negotiating table and commercial issues settled at the World Trade Organization? Apparently, our government decided that commerce and politics are now operationally connected. End of story. Economists were annoyed when President Trump went after China - in his failed attempt to level the playing field on trade deficits. Historians note that we actually hurt ourselves more than we hurt China, and consumer prices (as predicted), have risen to new levels - reflecting concerns of sustained inflation. Our government continues to go after China for alleged forced labor in XUAR region and everyone agrees that forced labor should never be permitted in any supply chain. However, China has a different view, claiming that they are retraining an ethnic population within their own country and others shouldn’t involve. If China would allow more inspections of their XUAR facilities, perhaps that would blunt some of the criticism and allow the world to ascertain if there is any merit to their argument.  As far as cotton and apparel are concerned, there are groups in America that are remain highly critical of China - but they also point to our government as being somewhat disingenuous - because they say that we have our own version of modern-day slavery to contend with. The U.S. Department of Justice overseas the Federal Bureau of Prisons – which runs apparel factories in our prison system under an entity called Federal Prison Industries (a government corporation) better know as UNICOR . That involvement with the USA prisons also raises alarm bells from those concerned about forced labor. Whatever the case, the sparing between the two countries isn’t helping anyone, and needs to ratchet down before it becomes an official cold war. Retailers, for their part, need goods on their shelves to sustain the American economy. At the same time, securing products to meet today’s standards of safety and sustainability are harder and harder to find. Alternate locations to China also remain highly problematic. Myanmar had a coup, Ethiopia has issues in the Tigray region, Haiti has an earthquake, Bangladesh and Vietnam are battling COVID. The bottom line is that retail needs China as a business partner and yet, our government is pushing them away. In early June of 1930, President Hoover received a letter signed by more than 1,000 economists urging him to veto the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill that was scheduled to arrive on his desk. Unfortunately, he signed it on June 17, 1930 - just as the depression was settling in, and President Hoover (even today) is regarded as one of the worst presidents in American history. While the Smoot-Hawley tariffs did not create the depression, they are credited with exacerbating it. The idea of tariffs flourished among politicians, and the thought was to raise this tax to protect our domestic agriculture. After the bill was passed, other countries countered with tariffs of their own. America’s overall exports fell from $7 billion to $2.4 billion in three years - largely because of Smoot-Hawley. On a similar note, when President Trump announced tariffs with China, our USA exports to China fell from $130 billion to $106 billion – also in three years’ time. The fact remains that China is currently America’s number one trading partner and number three export partner. China is also the second largest GDP economy and the largest purchasing power economy in the world. Certainly, that little boy who was digging a hole to China, didn’t realize that politics would enter the picture. No reasonable economist could ever tell America to cut off it’s nose just to spite its face. They would say we need to find a better way to solve our problems. Ernest Hemmingway once said it in a different way: “The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation, the second is war. Both bring temporary prosperity; both permanent ruin.  But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.” It’s truly time to re-think the direction of our relationship with China - and we need to do this before it’s too late.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickhelfenbein/2021/09/08/retail-digs-a-hole-to-chinaconcerning-some-investors-and-economists/,Retail Digs A Hole To China - Concerning Some Investors And Economists
"Bryan Danielson appeared live after AEW All Out 2021. AEW Dynamite after All Out 2021 advertised Jon Moxley vs. Minoru Suzuki, CM Punk, Bryan Danielson, The Elite with Adam Cole and MJF appearing live.  Last week’s broadcast of AEW Dynamite garnered 1.047 million viewers.        Malakai Black remains massively over as one of the most impossible-to-boo heels on the roster.  Black is starting to feel like he should be the next world champion, but after finding Cody Rhodes’ boot under the ring, he may not get past Rhodes in his return match.  Black has run through Arn Anderson, Anderson’s son, Nightmare Factory graduate Lee Johnson and now Dustin Rhodes. Cody should be back any day now.  There was a funny moment on commentary where Tony Schiavone implied CM Punk sold all the tickets to Arthur Ashe Stadium and Taz got very hot at him. This later made sense as Taz cut off CM Punk’s promo.  CM Punk was playing the role of John Cena as he almost hosted this show by hyping up which matches are coming next.  This was a very good match between two rising stars who don’t get nearly enough national TV time.  With Punk challenging Team Taz, they’ll resume their gimmick as high-end Washington Generals, but this feud with CM Punk will be great for Hobbs and Ricky Starks.  After this match, Dan Lambert cut yet another lights-out promo as it seems he’ll never run out of them.  MJF tripled down on being a vile heel, antagonizing everything around him breathing, including Wardlow.  MJF used everything from cheap heat, to abortion jokes to mocking Brian Pillman Jr.’s mother’s drug problem.  Brian Pillman Jr. has so much potential as a top babyface.  Ruby Soho and Jamie Hayter struggled to get on the same page throughout this match, which wasn’t their best.  Ruby Soho sold her neck fantastically following this match after being attacked by Britt Baker and co.  Cincinnati followed suit by singing along to Ruby Soho’s theme music.  Despite him not competing in this match, there was a loud “Colt Cabana” chant during this match.  After this match, The Dark Order engaged in an all-out brawl, hopefully just in time for Hangman Adam Page to return.  Today, I learned Tay Conti is not officially a member of the Dark Order.  Adam Cole began his promo by threatening Tony Schiavone over his friendship with Britt Baker.  Bryan Danielson implied that he should be able to cut his way to the front of the line like he could in WWE, and these so-called AEW fans cheered him for it. Due to the show running long, Minoru Suzuki’s theme had to be cut short and there was no “Kaze ni nare.”  Fans were chanting “This is awesome!” before Minoru Suzuki and Jon Moxley even touched and this bloody brawl delivered.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/08/aew-dynamite-results-winners-news-and-notes-on-september-8-2021/,"AEW Dynamite Results: Winners, News And Notes On September 8, 2021"

"Maura Tierney and Jeff Daniels in 'American Rust' on Showtime.  When the opportunity to portray compromised police chief Del Harris in American Rust first presented itself to Jeff Daniels, he knew he had to take the role. In fact, he’d had his eye on it for years.  The upcoming nine-episode Showtime drama series, which premieres September 12, is based on Philipp Meyer’s debut novel of the same name and Daniels has long been a fan of the book. The story revolves around those in a close-knit community in an economically devastated Rust Belt town in Pennsylvania where poverty and hardship are a way of life.  Del is fighting his own demons while also trying to protect the woman he loves (played by The Affair’s Maura Tierney) when her son is suspected of murder.  In a recent interview the Emmy winner and Tony nominee described why he had to take on this role. “I hadn’t played this guy before but I know him very well.” Jeff Daniels as Del Harris in 'American Rust' on Showtime.  Daniels, who comes from a working-class background, knows what it’s like to work long hours in harsh conditions. ""I used to work at my father's lumber company. I know these guys and American Rust is full of them. They're kicked to the bottom or can see the bottom from where they are. There's this feeling that they're somehow less and this show shines a light on that. There's a goodness and decency in these people who are often dismissed and left behind and we examine this. This show is about good people making very bad choices while trying to survive.""  He’s as well-known for his superbly acted dramatic roles in hits such as The Comey Rule, Newsroom, Godless and The Looming Tower as he is for his comedic chops in Dumb and Dumber.  ""I look for things that challenge me,” he explains. “I like to take on characters that are complicated because that's what makes it interesting."" For comparison, he brings up the classic Aaron Sorkin series Newsroom and his portrayal of Will McAvoy. ""Newsroom was like an attack dog! I wanted to work with Aaron very badly and I got it. There was this risk of failure at the time with this unknown thing that I was trying to pull off and that type of adrenaline is exciting.”   Portraying this complicated chief of police, he adds, gave him this same feeling. ""He's a complex man and I was able to play all parts of him. He’s a broken-hearted man who is trying to come off opioids and detox on his own, which doesn't go very well. Del, like all the characters in this story, is being pushed and pulled in different directions simultaneously.”  Sometimes, he adds, he isn’t sure how he’ll do a role once he’s taken it on. “This is when I say yes. I look for roles that I want to do as much as Newsroom and this was that. I wanted to play this guy. I was intrigued by him. It was the same with Godless. I had the same feeling with Frank Griffin where I just wanted to get in his head.""   Daniels executive produces alongside Dan Futterman (The Looming Tower, Capote, Foxcatcher) who serves as executive producer, writer and showrunner. Rounding out the cast are Bill Camp (The Queen’s Gambit), David Alvarez (West Side Story), Alex Neustaedter (Colony), Julia Mayorga (It Is Decidedly So), Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural) and Rob Yang (The Resident). The series is executive produced by Futterman, Daniels, Michael De Luca (Escape From Dannemora), Adam Rapp (The Looming Tower), Paul Martino (Inside Game), Katie O’Connell Marsh (Narcos, Hannibal) for Boat Rocker Studios, and Elisa Ellis.

"Weeks after United Airlines unveiled a Covid-19 vaccine requirement for all U.S.-based staff, the airline said Wednesday any workers who are exempted from the vaccines for religious or medical reasons will need to go on temporary leave starting next month. A United Airlines Boeing 737 passenger jet takes off at San Antonio International Airport in Texas. United will place employees with religious exemptions to the vaccines on unpaid personal leave Oct. 2, according to company memos provided to Forbes by United. Staff with medical exemptions will face medical leave (a company spokesperson told Forbes some staff will still get paid while on medical leave, but compensation policies vary based on collective bargaining agreements between United and labor unions). The airline said it won’t allow unvaccinated staff to return to flight attendant jobs and other customer-facing roles until “the pandemic meaningfully recedes,” but technicians and other operational staff who rarely interact with customers can return to in-person work after the company devises new testing and safety precautions. United did not disclose its vaccination rate to Forbes, but the company estimated that 90% of pilots and 80% of flight attendants were inoculated when it first rolled out its mandate last month, and it said in Wednesday’s memo that most staffers who were still unvaccinated when the requirement was announced are now vaccinated. “Given the large number of people who work at and travel through our operation daily, we need to do everything we can to ensure their safety,” United said in its memo. “As we said when we introduced our vaccination policy, everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated.” In early August, United directed its entire U.S. workforce — which numbers about 67,000 — to get vaccinated against the coronavirus: “The facts are crystal clear: Everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated,” company executives wrote. United’s requirement was set to kick in by late October or within five weeks of the Food and Drug Administration fully approving a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning staff will need to get vaccinated by the end of this month. A growing litany of other U.S. companies have coped with spiking Covid-19 cases and plateauing vaccination rates by requiring some staff to get vaccinated, including Google, Disney, CVS Health and Morgan Stanley. The list includes the nation’s largest employer: Civilian staffers for the federal government will need to either get vaccinated or face regular testing, President Joe Biden said in July, and the Pentagon is mandating vaccines for members of the military. Other airlines have varying policies. Hawaiian Airlines is mandating vaccines for staff, Frontier Airlines is requiring unvaccinated workers to submit test results, and Delta Airlines introduced a vaccine-or-test rule “while community case rates are high” two weeks ago, but some carriers — including American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Delta — aren’t mandating vaccines outright, CNN and CNBC reported last month. Meanwhile, Delta will hike unvaccinated employees’ health insurance costs by $200 per month starting in November, a policy it said would “address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company,” and American will reportedly stop offering pandemic leave to unvaccinated staff.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/08/united-airlines-staff-who-get-religious-exemption-from-covid-vaccine-mandate-will-need-to-take-unpaid-leave/,United Airlines Staff Who Get Religious Exemption From Covid Vaccine Mandate Will Need To Take Unpaid Leave

(Photo by Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) It seems like every day, BTS find a new reason to celebrate, as they hit some new high, reach a historic milestone on a chart somewhere in the world or prove their immense popularity in one more fashion, with today (September 8) being no different. The South Korean superstars see one of their most successful music videos finally hit a major mark, as fans continue to watch the upload non-stop, despite the fact that it has been out for years and they have delivered dozens of new songs since then. BTS’s “Fake Love” music video has just reached one billion plays on YouTube, which remains a milestone that only the most beloved clips can approach. There are now more than 250 music-related visuals that have made it to that lofty sum, but when considering there are millions upon millions of clips on the platform, so it’s still only a tiny fraction that have accrued at least one billion clicks. “Fake Love” is BTS’s fifth music video to reach one billion plays on YouTube. It joins “Boy With Luv” with Halsey, “DNA,” “Dynamite” and “Mic Drop” with Steve Aoki, all of which passed that figure previously. BTS made history in 2018 when they released “Fake Love,” as the song became their first top 10 smash on the Hot 100. The tune served as the first single from their third album Love Yourself: Tear, which became their debut No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Since then, the track has remained a fan favorite, and clearly their millions of followers haven’t stopped watching in the more than three years since the visual arrived. BTS are already one of the most successful acts on YouTube, and every day they become bigger and bigger on the world’s most-visited video hosting site. The band’s official channel, BANGTANTV, has thus far accrued more than 57 million subscribers, making it the third-most subscribed musician page on the site (behind Justin Bieber and Blackpink). Their clips on that channel have racked up a whopping 12.5 billion views, and that’s to say nothing of their actual music videos. Those treatments are hosted on their label’s page, Hybe Labels, which is now up to more than 61 million subscribers and more than 19 billion plays, though the channel features many artists aside from BTS.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/btss-billions-the-korean-band-now-claims-five-music-videos-with-one-billion-views-on-youtube/,BTS’s Billions: The Korean Band Now Claims Five Music Videos With One Billion Views On YouTube

(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for Dick Clark Productions ) On this week’s edition of the Billboard Global 200, Billboard’s semi-namesake ranking of the most popular songs in the world, The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber rule once again with their collaborative smash “Stay” while Ed Sheeran holds steady in the runner-up space with “Bad Habits.” Back inside the top 10 at No. 3 is “Butter,” which was originally just a BTS smash, but which is now credited to both the band and rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who lent her talents to a remix of the tune. “Butter” has now lived on the Billboard Global 200 for 15 weeks, and it appears to still just be getting started, as it’s returned to the highest tier on the tally. With another turn on the list, the summer-ready smash becomes one of the fifth-longest-charting songs among releases by South Korean musicians, and the cut is now on the same level as another sturdy win from one of the biggest and most successful girl groups in the Asian nation. With 15 weeks spent on the Billboard Global 200 apiece, “Butter” is now on the same level as Twice’s ""I Can't Stop Me,” the longest-running and highest-charting single from the South Korean all-female vocal troupe. Last time around, BTS’s cut was tied with two Blackpink smashes, “Lovesick Girls” and “Ice Cream” with Selena Gomez, both of which racked up 14 turns on the list before disappearing. “Butter” still has a long way to go before it matches the all-time record for the longest-charting song in Billboard Global 200 history by a South Korean musical act, and chances are it may never be able to catch up. BTS’s “Dynamite” is the top smash by any artist from that part of the world, as the tune has appeared somewhere on the tally every time the list has been published, and this frame it celebrates its first full year (52 weeks) on the ranking. Just one turn behind “Dynamite” comes Pinkfong’s “Baby Shark” with 51 weeks on the Billboard Global 200. Blackpink’s “How You Like That” found space on the tally for an impressive 33 frames, while BTS’s “Life Goes On” held on for 22 periods. “Butter” debuted atop the Billboard Global 200 chart back in June and led the charge for just two weeks. The track is one of the septet’s five No. 1s on the ranking, joining “Dynamite,” ""Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)"" with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo and “Life Goes On” when it opened in first place. Two months after “Butter” arrived ahead of every other tune, BTS collected their fifth leader with “Permission to Dance.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/bts-tie-twice-on-billboards-global-chart-for-the-fifth-longest-running-hit-among-korean-artists/,BTS Tie Twice On Billboard’s Global Chart For The Fifth-Longest-Running Hit Among Korean Artists

While many stores were closed in Q2 last year during the pandemic, sales increased 28% on a two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Company-operated store revenue increased 9% and e-commerce revenue increased 66% on a two-year CAGR basis. Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon, shared that the company is on track to exceed revenue targets made for 2023 by the end of this year, a full two years ahead of plan. McDonald said, “We achieved these results based on our performance before, during and emerging from the global COVID-19 pandemic. The company will likely achieve the goal to double its men’s business by the end of this year and remain on track to quadruple the international business by 2023.” The company will update its five-year growth plan next year. The focus of the company has been on an initiative called Power of Three which includes product innovation, omni guest experience and market expansion. Key elements from these initiatives include Air Support Bras and expanded product assortments in high impact training. The women’s business increased 26% and men’s revenue increased 31% on a two-year CAGR basis. Both company-operated stores and digital revenue have been strong and the company opened 11 new stores, ending Q2 with a total of 534 stores. McDonald stated, “​​We launched exciting new products, experienced strength across channels and geographies, and announced new partnerships that will allow us to become a leader in product sustainability.” Lululemon announced last month a partnership with leading sustainable materials innovator Genomatic which will bring renewably-sourced, bio-based materials into lululemon’s products. The two companies will work together to create a lower-impact, plant-based nylon to replace conventional nylon which typically requires a great deal of energy to produce, leading to excessive greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.  McDonald discussed the goal for lululemon to have 100% of products made from sustainable materials by 2030 as part of its Impact Strategy launched last October. The company is currently participating in the Mylo consortium focused on making materials with renewable ingredients found in nature such as the root of mushrooms. Products with Mylo will be introduced as part of the lululemon product assortment next year. The company discussed some supply chain disruptions including factories in Vietnam being closed due to COVID related issues. Lululemon secures about 30% of its finished goods from Vietnam. The company is pivoting to shipping goods on airplanes to expedite delivery based on the reduction and delay in production but this will add expense to gross margin. While inventory holdings were up 17%, with the trajectory of sales being up 61% the company would expect inventory to be higher to meet consumer demand but the supply chain issues impacted its ability to secure more inventory. McDonald said, “Lululemon’s vertically integrated model operating at higher gross margins levels have allowed the business to navigate and mitigate disruptions in the supply chain.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/09/08/lululemon-sales-surge-despite-supply-chain-issues/,Lululemon Sales Surge Despite Supply Chain Issues
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan authorized Covid-19 booster shots Wednesday for people 65 years or older living in places like assisted living facilities and nursing homes, making it the first state to expand booster shots to the general population outside of those who are immunocompromised, even though federal officials have not yet issued public guidance on booster shots.  ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND - APRIL 17: Maryland Governor Larry Hogan talks to reporters during a news ... [+] briefing about the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic in front of the Maryland State House April 17, 2020 in Annapolis, Maryland. Maryland Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon announced that all state public schools will remain closed until May 15. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Those 65 and older living in group care settings, residential drug treatment centers, and developmentally disabled group homes will be eligible to receive a booster shot in the state. Hogan said in a press conference pharmacies and other providers across the state can administer Covid-19 booster shots without a prescription or doctor’s order. He also said the state is prepared to move forward with booster shots for the wider population outside of those immunocompromised and over the age of 65 once they receive federal guidance. The announcement to start administering boosters to those outside of the immunocompromised group ignores current federal directives as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have not yet given approval for the shots. . The FDA and CDC did not immediately respond to Forbes request for comment, but Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday he expects at least one booster shot, Pfizer, could be approved by September 20, with Moderna’s approval potentially coming shortly after. “For several weeks now, states have had to operate without clear guidance from the federal government regarding these booster shots,” said Governor Hogan. “The limited guidance we have received has been confusing and contradictory, and it is still unclear when and how more people will become eligible. But all of the evidence makes it abundantly clear that we cannot afford to delay taking decisive action to protect our most vulnerable citizens.” The Biden administration had announced plans last month to widely distribute booster shots on September 20, indicating that it would be available to those fully vaccinated. However, while Pfizer booster shots are on track to meet that deadline, Moderna’s booster shots did not include strong enough data and is behind on the approval process, which led top health officials to ask the White House to scale back its plan to offer Covid-19 booster shots last week, according to the New York Times. The CDC said at the time, only some people who received the Pfizer vaccine would be eligible for a booster shot. The different reports drew criticism from Hogan this week, who said that his administration was getting “mixed messages” from the White House when it came to boosters. The World Health Organization is also calling to halt distribution of booster shots until more at-risk people around the world receive their initial Covid-19 vaccine shots.  859,000. That’s approximately how many seniors aged 65 and older in Maryland are fully vaccinated against coronavirus, amounting to 89.5%, according to Hogan. That is also the amount of people who would be eligible to receive a third booster shot. Moderna Will Likely Miss Booster Deadline—Pfizer Only Shot Expected For Sept.

"GameStop reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2021. (Photo by JIM WATSON / AFP) ... [+] (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Investors and retail watchers who were hoping the first GameStop earnings call with a new management team in place would provide a wealth of information about the company’s turnaround strategy didn’t get their wish Wednesday.  GameStop is still holding its playing cards close to its chest. The first conference call presided over by new CEO Matt Furlong lasted only six and a half minutes and contained very little beyond what was included in the earnings press release.  Furlong did, however, make two general statements about the company’s objectives. “We now have unified leadership fully focused on two long term goals - delighting customers and delivering value for stockholders,” Furlong said.  And, he added, “we are focused on positioning GameStop to scale while obsessing over competitive pricing, expansive selection and fast shipping.” Furlong didn’t take questions from analysts, and the company didn’t offer any future guidance.  For the second quarter, as it has for recent quarters, GameStop is letting the numbers speak for themselves, and those numbers, while much improved from last year, still show that executives need to have some brilliant moves up their sleeves in order to achieve the goals outlined by Furlong. GameStop posted a wider-than-expected loss for the quarter, but beat Wall Street forecasts for sales.  It reported net sales of $1.183 billion for the quarter ending August 1, up 25.6% from $942 million in the second quarter of 2020. Net loss for the quarter was $61.6 million, or 85 cents a share, which on an adjusted basis amounted to $55 million or 76 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 67 cents a share.  GameStop cut its net loss significantly from a year ago, when it had a second quarter net loss of $111.3 million or 1.71 cents per share. For the past two years GameStop

  stock has typically taken a dive after earnings, no matter what the numbers are. The average post-earnings drop since June 2019 has been 18%, according to Bloomberg. Its stock closed at $198.80, down 20 cents, or 0.1%, before the earnings release. It began dropping further immediately after the release, but the decline accelerated after the earnings call ended, widening from a decline of just over 2%, to over 8 percent 30 minutes after the call ended. GameStop’s stock jumped from $19 at the beginning of January to over $400 at the end of the month, as retail investors drove up the price. Since then, many of those investors have remained loyal to the stock, largely due to the belief that activist investor and Chewy

  veterans.  Furlong, in the call, said that GameStop has invested in adding tech talent in all divisions. It has added two new fulfillment centers, one in York, PA, which began shipping during the quarter, and one in Reno, NV, which will go online next year.  It also has expanded its inventory and product offerings, Furlong said.  GameStop had 9% fewer stores during the quarter, due to planned reductions in the store fleet, and pandemic related closings mostly overseas, a number that makes the net sales increase more impressive.  Location analytics firm Placer.ai reported this week that it saw steady growth in traffic at GameStop stores in August. Visits during the first three weeks in August grew by 3.3%. 2.6%, and 3.6% compared to 2019 levels, according to Placer.ai. While back-to-school season may be driving some of that traffic, “there is also real reason for optimism for a wider turnaround for a brand that certainly needed it,” Placer.ai reported.  Furlong called net sales “a primary metric by which stockholders should assess the company’s execution.”  The stock run-up this year allowed GameStop to put itself in a much better position by cashing in shares to retire debt. That means GameStop executives still have some time before they have to show more of their strategy cards.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2021/09/08/gamestop-is-still-keeping-us-guessing-about-its-ultimate-game-plan/,GameStop Is Still Keeping Us Guessing About Its Ultimate Game Plan
"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has no idea where he'll be playing in 2022. During “The Last Dance” — ESPN’s documentary that examined the rise and eventual dismantling of the Chicago Bulls — Michael Jordan talked about the bitterness he still felt about those Bulls being torn apart. “It’s maddening because I think we could’ve won seven (championships),” said Jordan, who led those Bulls to six NBA titles in eight years. “I really believe that.” The Green Bay Packers are set to begin their own “Last Dance”, with quarterback Aaron Rodgers quite possibly beginning his final year with the team. And while Rodgers is miles behind Jordan in championships (six to one), he’d love nothing more than to exit on a high like the Bulls’ star did back in June, 1998. “There is a lot of unknowns,” Rodgers said Wednesday. “I’ve talked about it at various times throughout camp. People who still have their contracts and situations down the line. So the right perspective is needed, I think, from all of us.  “But I think we don’t feel pressure. I’m speaking personally and I can’t speak for everybody. But the feel that I get with the energy in the locker room is not pressure, it’s focus. I think it’s the right perspective and the right type of focus.” Rodgers’ issues with Green Bay’s front office have been well documented. Five hours before the NFL Draft on April 29, word leaked that Rodgers didn't ever want to play for Green Bay again. The Packers selected quarterback Jordan Love in the first round in 2020 to be their quarterback of the future, and Rodgers was furious that the team never communicated their plans with him. Pro Football Talk reported, “(Rodgers) doesn't like anyone in the front office for a variety of reasons.” The Athletic reported that Rodgers referred to Packers’ general manager Brian Gutekunst as “Jerry Krause” — the man who built and tore down the Chicago Bulls dynasty in the 1990s — in group chats with teammates. Mike Garafolo of NFL Media also reported that Rodgers was telling prospective free agents considering Green Bay that “before you make any decisions, I’m probably not gonna be there.” Rodgers eventually folded his cards and returned to the team for the start of training camp. During a 32 ½-minute press conference on July 28, though, Rodgers said he had no clue where he’ll play in 2022. “Yeah, I really don’t know,” Rodgers said when asked about his future. “I think things in that direction haven’t really changed at all. I think I’m just going to focus on this year.” That year is here. And expectations are sky high. Green Bay returns the overwhelming majority of the group that’s gone 26-6 the last two years and reached the NFC Championship Game each of those seasons. Rodgers is coming off an MVP season. And there’s a terrific mix of veterans and young, emerging players. Wideout Davante Adams, who’s in the final year of his contract, knows this could be the end of the road for himself and Rodgers in Green Bay. In fact, both Adams and Rodgers posted an identical photo of Jordan and teammate Scottie Pippen to their Instagram accounts in late July. Knowing the “now or never” vibe that exists around the 2021 Packers, Adams said this group has something past Green Bay teams didn’t. “This is probably the hungriest team that I’ve ever been around, honestly, just because we have been so close a number of times now,” Adams said. “So I feel like everybody in the back of their mind they know how reachable it is and realistic we are to getting to that final step.” Rodgers and the Packers haven’t taken that final step since the 2010 season, when they defeated Pittsburgh, 31-25, in the 45th Super Bowl. A dynasty was predicted for that group, but instead, Green Bay has fallen short 10 straight years and gone 0-4 in NFC Championship Games in that time. Now, “The Last Dance” is upon us. Can Rodgers script the same type of ending Jordan and those Bulls once did? The football world can’t wait to find out. “We know we have a talented team, we know what the expectations are, we’re just focusing on accountability and holding each other accountable,” Rodgers said. “Because regardless of what happens with any of our situations, this group will not be together the way it is now in years down the line. So we’re going to enjoy this year for all that it has to offer, and each other, and I think that’s the right perspective to have when you get in this situation.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/08/will-the-green-bay-packers-last-dance-have-a-happy-ending/,Will The Green Bay Packers’ Last Dance Have A Happy Ending?

(Photo by Patrick McDermott/Getty Images) With a little more than two weeks before the first tee shots, the United States team is set for the 43rd Ryder Cup. U.S. Captain Steve Stricker announced six selections — Daniel Berger, Harris English, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Spieth — to the team for the biennial international showdown which returns later this month after a one-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Spieth will be making his fourth consecutive Ryder Cup appearance, the longest streak of any player player on the U.S. Roster while Finau is representing the U.S. for the second time. The remaining four of the players will be making their Ryder Cup debuts, giving Stricker five rookies overall, which he sees as something of a bonus when finalizing his roster.  “We've done some analysis of those rookies since 2008 and U.S. rookies are 40-29-17 record in Ryder Cup,” Stricker said. “So rookies fare very well in this type of format and we're excited to have these rookies."" When choosing his team, Stricker took into account the challenges provided by Whistling Straits, a 7,390-yard course nestled along the western shore of Lake Michigan that also played host to the PGA Championship in 2004, 2010 and 2015.  ""We were looking for the best players to perform here at Whistling Straits,"" Stricker said. ""These six guys that we picked fit Whistling Straits to a 'T.'” Their recent performances naturally played a role in their selection, too. All five rookies are ranked among the top 16 according to the most recent World Golf Rankings while Finau is currently 9th and Spieth 15th.  ""Definitely course fit and the way these guys have been playing,"" Stricker said. ""All six of these guys have been playing some really good golf and for a long period of time. I didn't want to just leave it to the last couple of events to make our determination on who was going to be picked. It's more about the body of work."" Notably absent from the roster is 31-year-old Patrick Reed, who has appeared in three previous Ryder Cups but is still recovering from a bout of pneumonia that left him hospitalized last month. ""That was a very difficult call,"" Stricker said. ""Kind of lost sleep over that one. He's a tremendous competitor. He brings a lot to match-play golf ... I think it was just the uncertainty really of his health and really the lack of play that went into our decision down the stretch."" The event gets underway Sept. 21. Captain: Steve Stricker Vice Captains: Fred Couples, Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson Players: Daniel Berger, Patrick Cantlay, Bryson DeChambeau, Harris English, Tony Finau, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Collin Morikawa, Xander Schauffele, Scottie Scheffler, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas.  Captain: Padraig Harrington Vice Captains: Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell Players: Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Viktor Hovlan, Paul Casey, Tommy Fleetwood Note: Automatic qualifying for the European team will not be complete until after this weekend’s BMW PGA Championship in the United Kingdom.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2021/09/08/us-captain-steve-stricker-rounds-out-ryder-cup-team-with-six-selections/,U.S. Captain Steve Stricker Rounds Out Ryder Cup Team With Six Selections

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the move during a press briefing on Wednesday, telling reporters Biden’s objective is to ensure the board members are “qualified to serve on them” and “aligned with [his] values.” The list includes former White House press secretary Sean Spicer and former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, who are on the Naval Academy’s board of visitors, and former senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who is on the Air Force Academy’s board. Vought, who Biden accused of hampering the OMB’s transition, and Spicer tweeted photos of the letters they received, with Vought stating, “No. It’s a three year term,” while Conway sent a letter to Biden telling him, “I’m not resigning, but you should.” Conway, one of Trump’s most visible political advisers during his time in the White House, said the move “seems petty and political, if not personal,” also alleging the effort to purge the typically non-political boards it is a “break from presidential norms.” The letters informed each appointee their positions would be terminated effective 6:00 p.m. Wednesday.  Psaki said during the briefing she will “let others evaluate whether… Kellyanne Conway or Sean Spicer and others were qualified or not political,” adding that Biden’s qualification requirements are “not your party registration.” In the waning days of his presidency, Trump used prestigious advisory boards and commissions as a reward for loyalty in what some experts described as abnormally political manner, giving board seats to former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao; former National Security Adviser Richard Grenell; former White House communications directors Stephanie Grisham and Hope Hicks; his former impeachment lawyer Pam Bondi; and Andrew Giuliani, the son of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The Biden administration already took steps shortly after the inauguration to dislodge some Trump appointees from more consequential boards. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin purged all the Pentagon’s advisory boards in February, dislodging Trump loyalists like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. 11. That’s the number of Trump-appointed board members the White House has asked to resign, according to CNN and the Washington Post.

(Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images for Coachella) Musical groups hailing from South Korea have been making inroads in the American music industry, the largest in the world, for many years now. Quite a few names have charted successful albums, a handful have scored real hits, but very few have seen any of their releases sell and stream well enough to earn highly coveted certifications that dictate when a piece of music has reached a special and notable threshold. Almost anytime a vocal band from that part of the world does manage to collect an honor, it’s a historic and major moment. Just a few days ago, the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) announced that Lady Gaga and Blackpink’s single “Sour Candy” had finally earned its first certification, becoming a gold record. Songs go gold in the U.S. after they have shifted at least 500,000 units between pure sales and streaming equivalents, and it is the lowest certification there is.  Blackpink, one of the most successful girl groups to emerge from South Korea, now has two gold singles to their credit, which is an impressive number for any K-pop act. Back in 2019 the four-member act’s own smash “Ddu-Du Ddu-Du” was certified gold as well. “Sour Candy” was released as a promotional single from Lady Gaga’s latest album Chromatica. The tune, which arrived just one day before the full-length it’s featured on, peaked at No. 33 on the Hot 100, giving the group their first top 40 smash in the U.S. 2020 turned out to be a huge year for Blackpink, as they went on to score two more placements in that important region, which typically defines when a song becomes a hit. Their own singles “How You Like That” and “Ice Cream” with Selena Gomez both spent time inside the top 40 as well, with the former matching the No. 33 high point of “Sour Candy.” Blackpink appears to be the only South Korean girl group to have any RIAA certifications to their name, at least thus far.

" In August, Filinvest Development president and CEO Josephine Gotianun-Yap made the gutsy call to go ahead with its listing of a REIT, into which it was injecting 17 office towers from its subsidiary Filinvest Land. At $236 million, Filinvest REIT Corp.’s IPO was one of the largest ever attempted on the Philippine stock exchange and the first for the Gotianun family in nearly a decade since its EastWest Bank went public in 2012.  Then came a red flag on Aug. 4, just eight days before the first trading day for the stock, when another large Filipino company, Del Monte Philippines, postponed its IPO due to Covid-induced market volatility.   “It never crossed my mind to stop the deal,” Gotianun-Yap said in a virtual media briefing around the time of the listing. “I really had confidence in the portfolio and it has proven to be most resilient and it survived the pandemic.” On Aug. 12, she got the deal done and the REIT listed.  It was a calculated move by Gotianun-Yap as the pandemic continues to roil global markets and Filinvest Development’s businesses, underscoring her resolve to diversify the $1.3 billion (market cap) real estate and banking company, which has roots going back six decades. Her family has come a long way from the used-car financing company Gotianun-Yap’s parents started in 1955—the same year Gotianun-Yap, 66, was born, the third of four children and the only daughter. In the 1960s, her parents ventured into their first property project in the central Philippine island of Cebu, and eventually grew that into Filinvest Development, now one of the country’s largest holding companies with interests in financial services, hospitality, utilities, property and sugar.  Mercedes Gotianun Today her mother Mercedes, 93, has a personal fortune of $1.25 billion, putting her at the No. 20 spot on the Philippines’ 50 Richest (her father Andrew died in 2016).  While her mother holds the title of chairperson emerita, Gotianun-Yap's older brother Jonathan is chairman. The two siblings share in the day-to-day running the family’s group of businesses, helped by another six of the next generation. Younger brother Michael also sits on the board. (Their brother Andrew Jr.—who died in May—was vice chairman of Filinvest Land until 2020.) In an email, Jonathan says of his sister: ""She is a strategic and innovative leader, and often comes up with solutions, suggestions or comments, which are quite out of the box and which have been instrumental in propelling Filinvest forward this last decade."" The siblings are playing the long game with Filinvest Development, and towards that end Gotianun-Yap has now built a war chest of funds approaching $700 million. In addition to the cash from the REIT listing, Gotianun-Yap was already sitting on $433 million raised from a fundraising effort started last year through international and domestic bond offerings.  Filinvest City's Northgate Cyberzone  Where will the money be deployed? Gotianun-Yap plans to invest 37 billion pesos ($740 million) over the next few years, with more than half slated for power and water utility projects. Another 16 billion pesos will be spent on office, industrial and residential developments this year, including 11 office towers across Metro Manila, Clark in Central Luzon and Cebu, she says.  “We’re significantly building our office segment,” Gotianun-Yap notes in an interview via video in late July before the REIT offering. “That’s a deliberate strategy on our part, to be more resilient.” She certainly needs resilience. The group’s hospitality, retail and residential properties have become collateral damage from what’s been happening in the broader Philippine property market due to the pandemic. Earnings at Filinvest Development have slumped, with first half profits down 42% to 4.2 billion pesos from a year ago, on top of 2020’s full year earnings down by 29%. Filinvest Development shares are down nearly 40% since the start of 2020 when the virus first emerged.  And while it’s still early days, some of the shine has come off its latest listing on the Philippine stock exchange. Filinvest REIT’s rental income fell 7% in the first half to 1.4 billion pesos from a year ago while revenue slid 13% to 2 billion pesos—though net profit got an 8% boost from a tax cut. The REIT’s share price has barely changed from its offering price of 7 pesos. “Never assume everything is going to be nice and dandy. We always have that at the back of our minds.”  The company’s move out of property and into other areas such as financial services, power and sugar didn’t fully insulate it from the wide-ranging effects of the pandemic. In the 2020 results, the five main divisions of the company had lower revenues year on year, except for banking and sugar, which eked out modest gains. Yet the declines were the steepest in property and hospitality, allowing Gotianun-Yap to claim some advantage from the diversification strategy set in place about a decade ago.  “Our 2020 performance signifies that we can be defensive during a downturn yet also well-positioned to capture growth when the economy recovers,” Gotianun-Yap and Jonathan said in their joint statement in Filinvest’s 2020 annual report. She’s confident that despite current downturns in the company’s business lines, creditors will continue to back its projects. “We’ve kept our credit record clean through the years,” she says. “We’ve always lived up to our financial commitments, whether it’s to our bondholders or to our customers or to our bankers. As a result, you can see that they’re always willing to support us.” Forbes Asia  Gotianun-Yap, who helmed Filinvest Development as CEO for the past 20 years before taking on the same role at the flagship property company, believes in being prepared, a lesson learned from her father. He led the company through decades of political turmoil that upended the economy, sent the peso crashing in the 1980s and included the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. “[The family] always makes sure that we have cash set aside in case there’s a crisis,” Gotianun-Yap says. “Never assume everything is going to be nice and dandy. We always have that at the back of our minds,” she says. Filinvest Development’s earnings had steadily tracked upward until the pandemic, with the company’s net profit reaching a record high of 12 billion pesos in 2019. Since she was born at the same time as the business, Gotianun-Yap literally grew up with it. “Dinner conversations revolved around the business,” she recalls. “Saturday mornings were spent in the office and we accompanied my parents to site inspections even as children.” After graduating from Ateneo de Manila University in 1975 with a degree in business management, she moved to the U.S. to get her M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Soon after, she joined the family business before rising to her present roles at Filinvest Development in 2000. Forbes Asia She took the helm at the listed Filinvest Land after her husband Joseph Yap—the current Philippine ambassador to Singapore—retired as president and CEO in 2012. Previously, she was president of commercial developer Filinvest Alabang, overseeing Filinvest City, the company's crown jewel development in southern Metro Manila.   Despite ongoing pandemic restrictions in the Philippines, Gotianun-Yap is confident demand for office space will continue to increase. The company’s decades-long focus on developing properties outside of urban centers should stand Filinvest in good stead. Companies are seeking to minimize employees’ exposure to Covid-19 by moving away from the crowded capital, according to a February report by property consultant JLL.  To that end, Filinvest is building a 280-hectare IT industrial park at New Clark City in Pampanga, 90km north of Manila, that will include space to cater to the booming demand for e-commerce. It’s also developing office and commercial buildings on 51 hectares of reclaimed land in Cebu City, the Philippines’ second-largest city.  She's optimistic that the residential property business—among the hardest hit by the pandemic—will return to pre-pandemic levels by next year. Revenue from the company’s residential portfolio improved 5% to 5.3 billion pesos in the first half from a year ago, reflecting resilient demand on record low interest rates and strong remittances from overseas Filipinos.  “Residential sales are starting to climb, with buyers getting used to transacting online and sellers learning how to do digital marketing,” she says. Julian Tarrobago, chief investment officer of Union Bank of the Philippines, sounded a note of caution. ""There are visible improvements in the economy but we’re not out of the woods yet,"" he says. ""It all depends on the reopening of the economy. Residential demand will probably return to pre-pandemic levels in late 2022 to early 2023, driven by demand from a young, vibrant and productive population.” To get ready, Filinvest wants to develop its massive landbank of 2,500 hectares over the next three years and is launching over 30 billion pesos worth of affordable and middle-income residential projects across the country including those in the provinces.  Filinvest Axis Tower, located in Filinvest City's Northgate Cyberzone. As with its office developments, “Filinvest is going in the right direction by developing residential projects outside of the capital,” says Lexter Azurin, deputy head of research at AB Capital Securities in Manila. “With Covid-19, more people prefer to live outside of Metro Manila. Demand for housing across the country is quite strong.”  A buoyant office sector and rising housing demand should lift earnings; Filinvest Land’s net profit is expected to rise 3% to 3.8 billion pesos this year and then jump to 4.8 billion pesos next year, according to the average estimate of nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg. But its strategy to move beyond existing businesses is where Gotianun-Yap is staking future growth—especially in sustainable fields such as utilities and renewable energy. “We are not pursuing sustainability initiatives for the sake of being green,” Gotianun-Yap says. “They have to make economic sense.”  In July, Filinvest Development’s utility division and Japanese partner Hitachi won a 25-year bulk water supply contract from Metro Cebu Water District. Under the 6.6-billion-pesos deal, the duo will build three desalination facilities that, once completed, will deliver 80 million liters of water daily across Cebu to help alleviate the city’s looming water crisis. “It never crossed my mind to stop the deal. I really had confidence in the portfolio.”  The company is investing another 13.9 billion pesos across a pipeline of renewable energy projects that include a 33-megawatt hydroelectric power plant in northern Philippines, a 20-megawatt biomass facility at its sugar mill in Mindanao and solar farms with a combined capacity of 95 megawatts. “It’s good that Filinvest is branching out from its traditional businesses,” says Azurin at AB Capital. “These projects will provide additional recurring income.” Aside from investing in businesses with long-term sustainability, Gotinaun-Yap is looking to cultivate the sustainability of the family by readying the next generation for bigger roles. Isabelle, her eldest child and only daughter, works as a special projects officer at EastWest Bank, while son Joseph Patrick is the chief technology officer of the company’s IT arm.  Francis, a son of Jonathan, is senior vice president of Filinvest Hospitality. “The third generation is being mentored to become responsible shareholders and have meaningful hands-on experience in the business,” Gotianun-Yap says.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanburgos/2021/09/08/philippines-filinvest-development-bolsters-its-portfolio-undeterred-by-business-downturns/,"Philippines’ Filinvest Development Bolsters Its Portfolio, Undeterred By Business Downturns"

The Philippines pulled out of a year-long recession in the second quarter with headline-grabbing 11.8% GDP growth—the fastest year-on-year quarterly expansion in over three decades.  The rebound contrasts dramatically with the 17% decline in the year-earlier quarter.

This story is part of Forbes’ coverage of Philippines’ Richest 2021. See the full list here. The $1 billion IPO in June of instant noodle maker Monde Nissin—the country’s biggest listing to date—gave a major boost to the wealth of its controlling shareholders and added three newcomers to the ranks. The Philippine food giant was cofounded 42 years ago by its president Betty Ang with her late father-in-law Hidajat Darmono, whose family also owns Indonesian biscuit maker Khong Guan. Ang, 66, saw her fortune swell to $1.4 billion, which she shares with her husband Hoediono Kweefanus (Monde Nissin’s vice chairman and Darmono’s second son). The IPO propelled Ang’s brother-in-law Hartono Kweefanus into the three-comma club for the first time. Kweefanus, 71, who chairs Monde Nissin, debuts with a $1.9 billion fortune, which he shares with two other siblings.(Darmono’s sons adopted a different surname from their father.) (From left) Hartono Kweefanus, Betty Ang and Henry Soesanto. Another relative to reap a bounty is Monde Nissin’s CEO Henry Soesanto, who’s married to Darmono’s daughter Monica. Their combined stake is now worth $795 million. Soesanto moved from Indonesia more than 40 years ago to manage the company’s first biscuit factory in the Philippines. Brothers Keng Sun and Peter Mar, grandsons of Mar Chew, founder of biscuit maker M.Y. San, make their debut with a $410 million fortune shared with their family. The Mars acquired shares in Monde Nissin after they sold M.Y. San (which is now called Monde M.Y. San) to the noodle maker in two tranches—60% in 2001 and the remaining in January, ahead of the IPO.  Forbes Asia Monde Nissin plans to use half of the IPO proceeds to expand its alternative meat brand Quorn in the U.S., after purchasing the British company in 2015 for £550 million ($760 million) in what was the company’s biggest-ever acquisition. Monde Nissin’s shares are up 24% since the listing.  While revenue flatlined, the company’s net profit plunged 96% year-on-year to 204 million pesos in the first half of this year, due to exceptional charges from the redemption of convertible bonds and the rising cost of raw materials such as palm oil and wheat.  First Metro Securities analyst Estella Dhel Villamiel is optimistic earnings will recover this year. “High commodity prices are transitory and should be mitigated by price increases as well as efficiency programs in place,” she says by email.  Ang and Darmono launched Monde Nissin, then a small biscuit factory in Laguna, south of Manila, with 4 million pesos in 1979, expanding to instant noodles a decade later. After slugging it out with rivals such as Nestle’s Maggi and Universal Robina’s Nissin Ramen for over three decades, Monde Nissin’s Lucky Me! brand has carved out a 70% share of the Philippine instant noodle market, according to Nielsen data.

"WATCH Katya Soldak’s conversation with Max Pokrovsky, the leader of Russian rock band Nogu Svelo! (To hear the full interview with musician Max Pokrovsky  – or to view other conversations with entrepreneurs, cultural figures and business people who experienced the transition from socialism to capitalism in Europe’s socialist bloc in the 1990s – follow my most recent podcast series, From Socialism to Capitalism.) When one thinks about what it takes to become a star in music toeing the line, adhering to a strict set of conservative rules and conforming to the guidelines of government and authority figures aren’t the first paths to success that leap to mind. But in the Soviet Union, that’s pretty much what you had to do to reach wider audiences with your music. Paradoxically enough, in modern Russia – after a brief period of freedom in the 90s – the need to support the party line (the current regime of Vladimir Putin) has become a necessity again. Otherwise, concerts can be cancelled and performances banned on the basis of various pretexts.  “We are not happy with what’s going on in Russia, with the political situation for five, or ten, or even more years—which we are talking about very, very loudly now,” says Max Pokrovsky, leader of the popular Russian rock band Nogu Svelo!. He and his band have experienced this phenomenon firsthand. For his open support of Alexei Navalny – a Russian opposition leader who was targeted by the Kremlin, poisoned and then imprisoned – Pokrovsky was the victim of retaliation from the powers that be. A series of concerts in Siberia, planned for this past spring, were cancelled by order of “the government.” Nogu Svelo!, a band that can fill concert halls and arenas throughout the Russian-speaking world, found itself blackballed from playing in its own country of origin. Pokrovsky has been based in New York for the past few years. Seeing his concerts canceled reminds us of Soviet rule from years past. In the USSR, all music needed the Soviet communist party’s stamp of approval. Disco, rock-n-roll, and jazz were forbidden fruit. While the entire world was listening to these genres, Soviet TV and radio played either patriotic songs, or soviet pop songs from a genre called “Estrada,” which was heavily censored. Even in the 1980s, as the USSR lurched steadily toward its eventual disintegration in the 1991, music and lyrics still needed to be approved, and it was illegal to videotape rock concerts, which the party thought might allow the music to spread the virus of freedom. Government officials would even stop concerts if they wanted to, or shut off power to venues that played music deemed dangerous to the masses. To get access to foreign music, people lucky enough to travel to other countries made illegal copies of records or tapes they’d smuggled back home with them, then made them available to others. To get around the red tape during the last decades of Soviet rule, musicians played “kvartirniks” or “house concerts.” At these underground, acoustic concerts performed in private apartments, people would pay cash to enjoy music, allowing the musicians to make a few rubles. The Kremlin saw kvartirniks as a form of entrepreneurial activity, which was a threat to the government-controlled music industry, so these secret shows were made illegal and sometimes raided by Soviet militia. In the 1980s, Pokrovsky and his band were accepted into an official rock club created by the Soviet government to try to control unauthorized concerts. They’d been obliged to audition, and their lyrics were analyzed and approved by KGB agents.  But when the Soviet Union fell apart in the early 1990s, government control of music collapsed with it and Pokrovsky and Nogu Svelo! reached a wider audience, particularly with their 1993 song, “Haru Mamburu” —  a wild, out-of-this-world example of gibberish set to music, which resonated with a young audience in the former Soviet bloc. “The society was ready to hear such a song—there was no certainty in our society,” Pokrovsky remembers. “These were crazy times for crazy people. We would’ve never succeeded if we appeared three years before or three years after our time.” The subsequent years saw political control – and politics in general – slip out of Russian pop and rock music, and artists had almost total freedom to express themselves however they wished. But recently that has changed and political and nationalistic ideology has begun to wiggle its way back into the entertainment industry. Pokrovsky, though dismayed, refuses to give in to the constraints of governments, and Nogu Svelo! are celebrating 33 years in the business with the release of a new album and subsequent live performances. “I’m still a musician”, says Pokrovsky. “I’m still pursuing some dreams here in the States.” Max Pokrovsky, leader of Russian rock band Nogu Svelo!

"Long-time Yankee captain Derek Jeter thanked friends, family, and fans at his Baseball Hall of Fame ... [+] Induction Wednesday. (Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Derek Jeter finally got his day in Cooperstown Wednesday.  The long-time shortstop and captain of the New York Yankees was one of four new members inducted by the Baseball Hall of Fame – after a protracted, twice-delayed wait caused by COVID-19.  Jeter, who played a record 20 years for the Yankees, was one vote short of unanimous election when his name was announced in January 2020. But his induction, scheduled for last summer, was cancelled twice – with the original July dates finally moved to September.  That put a damper on attendance, which had been expected to challenge the 2007 record of 87,000 who came to see Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken, Jr.  Though nowhere near the 100,000 crowd state and local police originally anticipated, the enthusiasm of those who did show was obvious from the start.  The crowd outside Clark Sports Center, about a mile from the Hall of Fame itself, was packed with people of all ages wearing navy blue T-shirts bearing pinstripes and Jeter’s No. 2. Supporters of fellow inductees Ted Simmons, Larry Walker, and long-time union chief Marvin Miller were there too, but their combined numbers paled in comparison to Jeter’s minions.  Many of them drove up for the day from New York, about four hours from Cooperstown by car.  Larry Walker, the first Canadian position player to reach the Hall of Fame, is also the first to ... [+] represent the Colorado Rockies. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) Unlike Jeter, a first-ballot pick, Simmons was selected in his 10th and final year on the ballot considered by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Both Simmons and Miller were picked by a veterans committee, outscoring five MVPs whose names also shared that ballot (Steve Garvey, Dave Parker, Dale Murphy, Thurman Munson, and Don Mattingly). In both elections, winning candidates needed at least 75 per cent of the vote.  Miller didn’t do that in seven previous tries and did not live to see his induction. He died at age 95 in 2012.  The program, telecast live on MLB Network, included a memorial tribute to the 10 Hall of Famers who died since the last induction in 2019, and introductions of 31 incumbent members.  Former Yankees Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage, Mike Mussina, and Mariano Rivera, inducted in 2019 after the only unanimous election in Hall of Fame history, got the loudest cheers — hardly surprising in an audience packed with Yankee supporters. Joe Torre, the manager who brought Jeter to the major leagues, also got a loud ovation.  But the day clearly belonged to Jeter, the ninth Hall of Famer to spend his entire career with the Yankees. A shortstop who started at age 20 and ended at age 40, Jeter won five World Series rings while wearing pinstripes. He had more hits (3,465) than anyone else who played for the team.  A former first-round amateur draft pick, Jeter got an $800,000 bonus when he signed in 1992 but earned millions during his 20-year tenure in the Bronx. He is now the chief operating officer of the Miami Marlins. New Hall of Famer Derek Jeter got more hits than any other player in the history of the Yankees. ... [+] (Photo by Nick Laham/Getty Images)  “What can I say in 15 minutes that will cover my entire career?” Jeter said as raindrops started to fall.  “Let me start by congratulating the three other inductees. “The great thing about baseball in its history. And we’ve lost too many Hall of Famers over the last 20 months.”  Jeter said he vividly remembered watching his dad play shortstop for his corporate team. “He showed me how to play, how to win,” said the long-time Yankee star. “My dad taught me to be patient, to think before I speak. And my mom taught me that was anything was attainable as long as I worked harder than anyone else.  “Both of you convinced me I could achieve anything and that I can prove the doubters wrong. “I wanted to prove I belonged. I had one goal in my career: to win more than anyone else. We did that.”  Jeter told the crowd that Jackson, who played for the Yankees, used to stop by his locker in the Yankee clubhouse. ‘What do you have for me, Reggie?’ Jeter remembered. The slugger would get on me and say, ‘You’re not a Hall of Famer yet.’ So, Reggie, can I get on you now?”  Jackson was seated on the dias behind Jeter with 31 other incumbent Hall of Famers who came to Cooperstown for the unusual September induction.  Among the many famous faces in the VIP section of the crowd included basketball great Michael Jordan and former Yankees CC Sabathia, Jorge Posada, Tino Martinez, and Bernie Williams, who played the National Anthem on his guitar to start the day’s ceremonies.  “I have a message to the players,” said Jeter, the last of four speakers at the ceremonies. “This is a game that requires dedication, sacrifice, and focus,” said Jeter, “and there’s no individual greater than the game.”  The induction of the Class of 2020 swells the roster of the Hall of Fame to 333. No one was chosen for the Class of 2021 by the baseball writers and the vote of the veterans committees, scheduled for last December, were postponed for a year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2021/09/08/after-long-wait-derek-jeter-wows-crowd-at-hall-of-fame-induction/,"After Long Wait, Derek Jeter Wows Crowd At Hall Of Fame Induction"
"CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 01: Zach LaVine #8 of the Chicago Bulls readies to pass against the Denver ... [+] Nuggets at the United Center on March 01, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) Going into the 2021 summer, it was clear the Chicago Bulls were in dire need of making changes to better equip All-Star Zach LaVine with a supporting cast he could trust. Yet, despite acquiring two elite playmakers in Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan, not to mention adding depth to a rotation that sorely needed it, the Bulls are still met with a fairly high level of skepticism. As such, the Bulls are coming into 2021/2022 on a mission to prove the logic behind their decisions made since the start of August. However, let's get some housekeeping items out of the way first. The Bulls want to be competitive, make no mistake about it. They wouldn't have spent over $160 million on two players just to end up with 35 wins and watching the playoffs from home. However, the decisions made this summer were more so about changing the perception around the franchise, which remains one of the most recognizable sports brands in the world, than it was about winning an NBA championship in 2022. Team President Artūras Karnišovas and General Manager Marc Eversley, affectionately known as ""AKME"", took a sledgehammer to the roster of last season, starting at the March 25th NBA Trade Deadline, where they acquired All-Star center Nikola Vučević to pair with LaVine, and spent the better part of August upgrading the roster in every nook and cranny. LaVine, who made his All-Star debut last season, is now joined by another All-Star in Vučević and a former All-Star in DeRozan, which is star power the former regime of John Paxson and Gar Forman failed to gather, despite plenty of opportunities. This sent a signal to NBA players that the Bulls are once again serious about returning to the days of competitiveness. While it's always fair to question any team that hasn’t made the playoffs in four years, context does matter. The Bulls of recent years were playing fringe NBA players such as Denzel Valentine, Chandler Hutchison, Cristiano Felicio and Ryan Arcidiacono as heavily featured rotational players, while hoping for upside players such as Wendell Carter Jr and Lauri Markkanen to take major leaps in development. While Carter Jr did look considerably better after getting traded to the Orlando Magic in the Vučević trade, he nevertheless isn't on the same level as Vučević quite yet, and likely will take a few years to get there. Meanwhile, Valentine, Felicio and Arcidiacono are currently not in the league, and Hutchison couldn't muster more than a two-way contract with the Suns. Chicago's depth chart, which now features Troy Brown Jr, Alex Caruso, Tony Bradley, Derrick Jones Jr, Alize Johnson, Stanley Johnson and long-time Bull Coby White, is one that oozes proper NBA talent, unlike bench variations of the past. (Note that White started the vast majority of last season and due to upgrades got pushed to the bench.) This leads us to the starting line-up where Ball is now occupying the point guard position without the Bulls needing to sacrifice White. Instead, they traded Tomas Satoransky, a rotation player who is best suited to come off the bench, in the Ball trade. At the wing spot, the Bulls spent big on DeRozan, and while the contractual value was significant, so is the upgrade. Chicago started rookie Patrick Williams at the slot last season, and is now moving the second-year man up a position to make room for DeRozan. Losing his spot in the starting line-up, and on the team, was Thaddeus Young who got traded to the Spurs in the DeRozan trade. While Young had a career-year for the Bulls last year, DeRozan's scoring, ball-handling, passing and positional flexibility offers an offensive injection that Young could never have provided the team. In a nutshell, the Bulls upgraded both their starting unit and their depth this summer, and by a not insignificant margin. One buzz word that has filled the Chicago Bulls discourse after their summer transactions has been ""fit"". Concerns linger about Chicago's new roster construction, and whether or not LaVine and DeRozan can play alongside one another. Conceptually, the pairing makes a lot of sense. LaVine, who last season averaged 27.4 points and hit 3.4 three-pointer per game at 41.9%, is a shot-maker of such quality that he will immediately allow DeRozan the space to operate with the ball in his hands. The numbers also seem to back this up. LaVine hit a whopping 48.6% of his nightly 2.5 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts, and was in the 97th percentile as a cutter, according to stats from NBA.com. That was without the presence of a true playmaker. LaVine's off-ball game is practically tailored for ball-handling facilitators, meaning he should get plenty of looks generated by both DeRozan and Ball, not to mention Vučević who is one of the best passers in the NBA at his position. So maybe the problem is with Vučević, who needs post-ups during the course of a game? Not likely. Vučević ranked fourth in the league in points per game off of post-ups (4.5) and led the league in passes out of post-ups at a whopping 5.7 per game that led to an also league-leading 1.1 assists per game via post-ups.  Vučević simply doesn't force the issue down there and his passing chops from the low block forces defenders to make tough decisions. If they defend him with single coverage, there are strong odds that Vučević will get a solid look for a score. If they send a double-team after him, they're essentially asking the league's highest volume post-up passer to find open players, while literally being flanked by one of the best cutters in the game. Worth noting is that Vučević is also fairly dangerous as a pick-and-pop option. The 7-footer canned 176 three-pointers last season at a 40% clip, meaning the Bulls can play plenty of four-out basketball, with DeRozan functioning as the lone non-shooter from three-point range. As for Ball's role on the team, he'll do what he does best. Run the plays hard in transition, getting his teammates the ball in stride and scoring mostly opportunistically in transition or as a spot-up shooter in half-court settings. In short, the Bulls now have weapons they only dreamed of having a year ago. Three players on the roster, LaVine, DeRozan and Vučević, have all averaged 23 or more points in a year, which offers substantial offensive upside. They have bench scoring in White and can mix and match the minutes so two high-volume scorers are on the court at all times. For the Bulls to become a poor offensive team, a lot of things have to go wrong at the same time. Defense is an area where the Bulls could end up struggling. The aforementioned trio of LaVine, DeRozan and Vučević aren't exactly known for great defensive impact, and given that all three are projected to play over 30 minutes per game, it does stand to reason there will be periods where the Bulls give up a lot of points. However, all is not lost on that end of the floor. The addition of Alex Caruso, who is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, will help provide some help for the second unit, and he can be inserted into line-ups that feature most of the starters. Ball, who stands 6'6 and moves well laterally, is coming in with a defensive reputation that admittedly is a bit ahead of where he actually is. That said, his size alone will cause problems for opposing offenses, and given that he's just 23, there’s no reason to expect him to be a finished product on that end of the floor. Then there is a wild card in form of Patrick Williams, who last year guarded some of the best forwards in the league, including LeBron James, and is looking to take a major leap on that end of the floor in his second season. With Troy Brown Jr earning himself minutes in Chicago's rotation last year due to defense, and the Bulls signing Stanley Johnson and Alize Johnson from the Toronto Raptors and Brooklyn Nets respectively, the team does have some bench defense that should help keep them mostly respectable. Is it enough for the Bulls to become an elite defensive team? Most likely not, but that needn't be a major issue given how great offensive teams have significant upside. The Atlanta Hawks, ranked 21st defensively last season, made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, primarily due to elite offensive execution. That’s not to say the Bulls will go that far, but it underlines how elite offenses can reach a higher level, and it further underlines how the Bulls, using a recipe of elite offense and middle-tier defense, can produce a sustained level of success throughout the course of this season. Overall, with a roster so drastically changed from one season to the other, it's understandable that there is an underlining ""we'll believe it when we see it"" element to this team. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Bulls are expected to land the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Regardless of projections and expectations, what should be an undeniable fact is that the Bulls upgraded the talent level of their roster considerably.  Going from giving a vast amount of fringe NBA players rotation minutes to having enough established players to go a legitimate 10 deep in the regular season is objectively a good thing. They may have sacrificed a chunk of their future in doing so, but that's the price of doing business. For the Bulls, now is the time to put it all together and test out what they have.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/mortenjensen/2021/09/08/how-the-chicago-bulls-can-prove-doubters-wrong-this-season/,How The Chicago Bulls Can Prove Doubters Wrong This Season
"Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has agreed to purchase a controlling stake in the Four Seasons hotel ... [+] chain through his investment firm, Cascade.  Bill Gates will purchase a majority stake in the Four Seasons hotel chain for $2.21 billion, the company announced Wednesday. Cascade Investment LLC, which manages the Microsoft cofounder’s massive fortune, agreed to buy half of Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s stake in the hotel chain. The all-cash deal pushes Gates’ ownership from 47.5% to 71.25% and values the Four Seasons at $10 billion in enterprise value. The deal is expected to close in January 2022. The purchase is a bet by Gates in part on the rebound of high-end business travel to big cities, which has suffered a blow during the pandemic. At least two Four Seasons hotels —including the one in midtown Manhattan— are currently closed; the midtown Manhattan location, which is owned by Beanie Baby’s billionaire founder Ty Warner, is “undergoing substantial infrastructure and maintenance work,” according to a note on its website. However, one industry insider told Forbes that luxury hotels such as the Four Seasons lose money unless they operate at very high occupancy rates.  In a statement, the hotel operator said the deal “marks a pivotal point in the evolution of Four Seasons” and affirms Cascade’s commitment to provide the Four Seasons “with resources to accelerate growth and expand its strategic goals.” Through his investment vehicle Kingdom Holding Co., Prince Alwaleed will hold onto his remaining 23.75% stake. Forbes long counted the Saudi Prince as a billionaire — and one of the richest people in the world, but removed him from the Forbes billionaires list after November 2017, when Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman kept Alwaleed and other princes and business leaders captive in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and reportedly extracted billions of dollars from them.   Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons Founder and Chairman, will also retain his 5% stake through Triples Holdings Limited, the company said. Bill Gates is currently ranked by Forbes as the fifth richest person in the world, worth an estimated $132.8 billion fortune. In addition to its Four Seasons investment, Cascade is the largest private owner of farmland in the U.S. Gates’ investment firm also owns stakes in car dealership AutoNation, farm equipment manufacturer John Deere and other stocks.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/09/08/bill-gates-investment-firm-buys-controlling-stake-in-four-seasons-hotels-for-22-billion/,Bill Gates’ Investment Firm Buys Controlling Stake In Four Seasons Hotels For $2.2 Billion
"Elizabeth Holmes’ defense attorney argued during the trial’s opening statements on Wednesday that the Theranos founder had no intention of defrauding investors with her blood testing company and instead had the genuine intention of revolutionizing the healthcare industry, but failed because of what he described as “human” reasons.  Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos, arrives at the federal courthouse for jury selection ... [+] in her trial, Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021, in San Jose, Calif. Holmes faces 12 felony counts alleging she engineered a massive fraud that duped a litany of rich investors with a blood-testing technology that she promised would be able to screen for hundreds of diseases with a finger prick. (AP Photo/Nic Coury) Defense attorney Lance Wade painted Holmes to the jury as a hard worker who created a genuinely “innovative” company, stressing that Theranos earned 176 patents valued at hundreds of millions of dollars and received positive feedback for its blood tests, which were cheaper than its competitors’, according to reporters from NPR and Law360 inside the courtroom.  “Elizabeth Holmes did not go to work every day intending to lie, cheat and steal,” Wade said, noting that the embattled blood testing machines that ultimately led to Theranos’ downfall were just a slice of the company’s offerings as it also developed assays, hardware and software “from scratch.”  Wade challenged the prosecution’s portrayal that Theranos failed because of fraud, instead describing its downfall as the consequence of well-intentioned “mistakes” like poor operations in the company’s labs.  He then lay the foundations to pass blame for these mistakes, suggesting it was Theranos’ laboratory directors who were responsible for making sure blood tests were accurate and reliable.  As was anticipated, Holmes’ defense attorney signaled he may point a finger at Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who is also Holmes’ ex-boyfriend, describing her reliance on him as her primary advisor as “one of her mistakes.”  Wade also denied that Holmes deceived investors by exaggerating her company’s capabilities, saying he will present evidence that the investors in this case were “incredibly sophisticated and knew the risks” and were actually pushing to invest in Theranos.  The reality of the case is “far more human and real, and oftentimes, I hate to say it, technical and complicated and boring” than what the federal government has suggested, Wade said.  Wade’s portrayal of Holmes’ leadership of Theranos deeply contrasts with that put forward earlier in the day by the federal government. U.S. Attorney Robert Leach described Holmes as “well aware” of the shortcomings of her company’s blood testing machines and stressed that she went to great lengths to cover them up. Leach listed off examples of Holmes lying to investors, including through a forged report from Pfizer, and painted the “fraudulent scheme” as the result of various early financial struggles faced by Theranos.  “Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” Leach said.  Holmes faces a total of 12 charges—two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 10 counts of wire fraud—for allegedly engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to deceive investors, doctors and patients from 2010 to 2016 alongside Balwani, with whom she was romantically involved. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and hit with a $250,000 fine, in addition to restitution, for each count. Holmes and Balwani have both pleaded not guilty and are standing trial separately (Balwani’s trial is set to begin January 2022).  The trial—which is taking place at a federal courthouse in San Jose—is expected to last between three and four months, with a potential witness list featuring some of America’s most powerful politicians and businesspeople. Among those who could be called to the stand by the prosecution are former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was a Theranos board member, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, an investor. Holmes’ lawyers submitted a list of dozens of possible defense witnesses late Tuesday which included former employees, Food and Drug Administration officials and powerful board members like former CDC Director William Foege and former Senate Majority Leader William Frist. Holmes was also on the list as she may choose to testify.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/elizabeth-holmes-lawyer-says-she-made-mistakes-but-failure-is-not-a-crime/,"Elizabeth Holmes’ Lawyer Says She Made ‘Mistakes,’ But ‘Failure Is Not A Crime’"
"A frequent conversation piece among the libertarians and conservatives I lunch with concerns the “worst president in our lifetimes.” One elder routinely answers LBJ for his expansion of the war in Vietnam combined with the welfare state expansion he presided over domestically. Others cite Barack Obama, but my answer every single time is George W. Bush.  To those who say Obama I always respond with an expressed desire to stage a public debate about the merits of Obama vs. Bush based on my confident belief that Obama’s presidency doesn’t come close to Bush’s on the error front. Think about it.  With Bush there was his signing of McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform not because he believed in it, but because he erroneously presumed the Supreme Court would bail him out. There was “No Child Left Behind” for schools, as though the federal government should have a role in education, and then there was the expansion of the federal government’s role in the provision of drugs for the elderly despite Bush’s professed belief in limited government.  Responding to the failures of Enron and Worldcom within six months of each other, failures that didn’t spook the markets much at all, Bush zestily signed into law Sarbanes-Oxley (legislation that most certainly did spook the markets), thus criminalizing failure in an economy that had long derived its dynamism from – you guessed it – a lack of barriers to the decline of corporations no longer meeting the needs of shareholders. Bush gave us Harriet Miers on the supposition that someone who needed to “bone up” on Griswold v. Connecticut was actually a wise jurist.  Even though government spending is the ultimate tax on growth (this is not a comment on deficits, which both sides needlessly waste time on when the other Party is in power), Bush never vetoed spending bills, he reversed the Reagan-Clinton emphasis on a strong, stable dollar that had been such a major driver of economic vitality in the ‘80s and ‘90s, plus when banks and investment banks began to go belly-up in 2008 (arguably symptoms of the Bush Treasury’s confusion about dollar-price stability), the rhetorically “free market” Bush claimed the markets weren’t working on the way to bailouts that logically caused the “financial crisis,” as opposed to staving off market mayhem.  All this leaves out Bush’s decision to bring “democracy,” something the Founders logically were rather skeptical of, to the Middle East. The two wars Bush was certain about haunt us to this day as the developments of recent weeks indicate. The view here is that Bush has no peer when it comes to failed presidents, which is a useful jumping off point when it comes to reviewing Peter Osnos’s very engrossing new memoir, An Especially Good View: Watching History Happen. The title is apt for Osnos’s book in consideration of his time at the Washington Post (he was a correspondent in Vietnam, and bureau chief in both Moscow and London), not to mention his work as a publisher where he edited and brought to market books by people with names like Carter, Clinton, Obama, Trump, Reagan (Nancy), Noonan (Peggy), and many, many others. Up front, Osnos is a man of the Left, which most readers have probably already deduced, but he’s not completely left wing. Please read on.  Ok, so why the comment on Bush? It’s a way of prefacing frustration with Osnos’s assertion late in what will be referred to going forward as A View that history “will regard Barack Obama as an outstanding president.” That it didn’t ring true isn’t a partisan comment. Indeed, while the view of many younger types on the Right that Obama is “the worst” in their lifetimes doesn’t stand up to basic history, neither does Osnos’s association of “outstanding” with #44.  Really, what does Obama have to show for his two terms? Some will point to passage of the mis-named Affordable Care Act, but if not for John Roberts (a George W. Bush Supreme Court pick, naturally….) bailing out the ACA in the most convoluted of ways, his signature legislation is long forgotten. He “saved us from a 2nd Great Depression”? Please. The bailouts of financial institutions, faux stimulus measures of the government spending variety, and the propping up of GM et al largely took place under Bush, and by their very nature delayed what would have been a much bigger recovery.  Arguably the best thing for Obama’s presidency was that after running as a healer and a centrist in 2008, he tacked left once in the White House on the way to the Democrats’ loss of the House in 2010, which in many ways ended the legislative portion of Obama’s presidency. By 2014, the Senate was in GOP hands too. By 2016 the GOP controlled the White House. This is notable in consideration of a long ago quip from lefty historian Richard Reeves that Bill Clinton’s presidency was Ronald Reagan’s third term. But when given the chance to vote for Obama’s third term through the election of Hillary Clinton, the electorate went with an underfunded, and rather controversial figure in Donald Trump.  About the 45th president, Osnos knew him well. He quarterbacked The Art of the Deal. Osnos is plainly remorseful about Trump’s political rise, but doesn’t apologize for his role in Trump’s first two books. In his words, “I was trained in journalism, and Trump was a terrific story.” Of greater importance, Osnos makes the point that “Trump doesn’t spend money if he doesn’t have to.” Osnos wrote the latter to put to bed any rumors that Trump bought himself a monstrous seller in The Art of the Deal, but it’s something that speaks louder about 2016. An outspent amateur in Trump beat the individual who was supposed to carry on Obama’s presidency. This is written by someone who, probably like Osnos himself, thinks Trump’s stance on immigration was unfortunate, and yes, very un-Republican. This comes from someone who thinks Trump’s stance on China (for an excellent book on China largely free of the economic fallacy embraced by both sides, read Osnos’s son Evan’s spectacular Age of Ambition) was similarly backwards, and anti the working classes whom Trump seemed to inspire. It’s all a long way of asking if Osnos really believes Obama was “outstanding” despite the electorate’s verdict? The speculation here is that Osnos was charmed more by the engaging, charming and charismatic person in Obama than the former president’s achievements. About Obama’s presidency, the guess here is that Osnos could be convinced otherwise about its greatness? Maybe the above assertion is a reach, but maybe not. Osnos once again isn’t completely left wing, lefty, or “liberal” now that American lefties have stolen the adjective from true liberals. Writing about his undergraduate alma mater in Brandeis, Osnos recalls how it “struggled” in the 2000s, “as so many universities did, with the illiberal contradictions of political correctness.” The latter implies an understanding of how over-the-top ridiculous the modern Left can at times be. For those wondering what Osnos was specifically referring to at Brandeis, he notes with disdain that “the university accepted the papers of Lenny Bruce, a crude, lewd, and very funny comedian of the 1960s, but it was unable to proceed with a play about Bruce” because “students objected.”  More broadly, Osnos saw Moscow up close. To be more clear, he saw the Moscow of the 1970s up close. Osnos saw how state control of resources quite simply didn’t work. Moscow anecdotes from A View include taking shoes to a cobbler for resoling only for them to be returned “with nails in them through the bottoms,” of taking a suit to the cleaners only for it to be “folded all wrong and without buttons,” of how his wife Susan cut his hair “and took care of her own.” The latter is on its own quite an admission from the author in consideration of how the always well-dressed Osnos (nicknamed “Peter Prep” at Cheshire Academy) was known to be the best-dressed at the Washington Post.  Osnos is clear that the Soviet economy he saw was in all-too-many-ways fake, or in his words “So much of what the Soviets claimed for their economic achievements were what was widely known as pokazuka (for show), the Potemkin villages of facades that covered up widespread conditions from third world poor to shoddy first world style.” Cato Institute co-founder Ed Crane observed much the same when he visited the Soviet Union in 1981. He scoffed at the CIA’s laughable estimates of the Soviet economy’s size because, like Osnos, he could see that there was little “economy” to speak of. Neither of Osnos’s children were born in Moscow (the first at Susan Osnos’s family’s compound on Lake Michigan, the second in London), and as he ultimately concludes, “There were limits” to “our desire to immerse ourselves in Russian life.” All that plus Osnos is a huge fan of Natan Sharansky (“the bravest person I’ve ever known”), published the former Soviet dissident’s memoirs, and this is notable in consideration of libertarians I know who think the libertarian Cato Institute should award Sharansky with its Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty. The lefty in Osnos would seemingly agree….?  Yet frustration would follow encouraging passages. In writing about the end of the Cold War, Osnos points to three Europeans (including Pope Paul) who brought on its end, but does so without mentioning Margaret Thatcher, or much more glaringly, Ronald Reagan. The omission subtracted from a book that was once again very engrossing, and realistically, very difficult to put down. Still, how does any big-time thinker leave out Reagan when contemplating the fall of the Soviet Union? This isn’t to minimize the Pope’s role, but does Osnos really believe the Pope, Lech Walesa, Sharansky and others would have been nearly as bold absent Reagan courageously stating at the House of Commons in 1982 that “freedom and democracy will leave Marxism and Leninism on the ash heap of history”? Or Reagan telling Mikhail Gorbachev to his face that “We win. You Lose”? Reagan’s role in the Cold War was ignored in the book, but Osnos twice unearths Clark Clifford’s line uttered at Katherine Graham’s house about Reagan being “an amiable dunce.” Osnos plainly isn’t partisan in all ways, A View wouldn’t be nearly as readable if he were, but it’s at least arguable that a very excellent book was occasionally brought lower by the partisanship that, in the author’s defense, is within all of us.  Where Osnos’s quietude about Reagan’s merits becomes more interesting is when he writes of Nancy Reagan. He clearly enjoyed working with her, and unlike many famous authors, he writes that “I never recall her showing impatience with us.” He also writes highly of the speechwriter most associated with Reagan in Peggy Noonan. They say capitalism brings out compassionate acts from those who are internally scrooge-like, and just the same, it would seem that a desire to prosper results in strange bedfellows. Osnos is a Democrat, obviously, but as a publisher and editor he’s cheered on more than a few from the GOP, or conservative side.  Thinking a little bit more about what Osnos saw in Moscow, why isn’t he libertarian today? If he saw up close just how backwards near total government control from the Commanding Heights was, why would he think what fails in total works in limited fashion? Osnos cites Americorps more than once as a triumph of the Clinton years, your reviewer has never heard of Americorps, but what allegedly heroic government creations exceed the genius of those created in the for-profit sector? It’s probably naïve, but those who saw the horrors of state control the most closely (add Hedrick Smith and Fox Butterfield to this list) should be most skeptical about the role of government today…. Away from partisanship or a lack of it, the book ultimately hums along because the author is a great storyteller with very interesting things to say about very interesting people. I’d never heard of Jason Epstein, a senior personage at Random House, but wish I’d met him. I’ve met his wife, Judith Miller, in of all places the green room at Fox. The endlessly urbane Epstein apparently once told a complaining Mario Cuomo (his wife couldn’t find his book in San Francisco bookstores) that “Governor, no author since Homer has ever found his book in a bookstore.”  As for the atmosphere of publishing in the 1980s, the young people were in pursuit of “evening fun, cocaine, booze.” Love or hate all three, you want to see what Osnos saw.  Alan Dershowitz had a “nasty belligerence” to him, while Tip O’Neill, under pressure to deliver the gossip in his own memoir, told his editor that “JFK would screw a skunk.” Bill Clinton was a “superb politician” and “political thinker,” but also a “jerk.” Kareem Abdul-Jabbar couldn’t be bothered to smile at his son, Evan. Oh well, there’s a reason he’s never moved far in basketball post-NBA despite being a remarkable player. It’s hard to find someone who can say they were charmed by him.  Osnos also wrote at length about the economics of publishing, which will be of particular interest to those who’ve been published, or who want to be. Most interesting is when he writes of the economics of a “six-figure deal” that everyone wants. Osnos is pretty clear that for most authors lucky enough to reach the designation, the victory is hollow. Agents take their 15 percent, followed by taxes, followed by essentially working for less than the minimum wage. The view here is that the best economics in publishing are the 50/50 splits that right-of-center publishers increasingly offer people like yours truly.  Osnos also offers lots of interesting anecdotes about how primitive technology used to be. Among other things, Marilyn Monroe for a time lived in the building his parents raised him and his brother in in New York City, but when they crossed paths they didn’t have a camera (this being the 1950s) to snap her. Osnos’s group house at Brandeis didn’t have a TV such that JFK’s assassination wasn’t as real to them as it would have been to later generations. Phone calls were so expensive in the ‘70s that Osnos “would advise the foreign desk days in advance that I was planning one” from Moscow to Washington, D.C. On his first day at Random House in 1984, there was a typewriter waiting for him at his desk…. This is good information for younger readers on its face to show the evolution of technology, but also raises contradictions. As Osnos brings A View to a close, he writes of “fault line[s] in “our culture” that allegedly include “inequality.” This read as a throwaway line. Osnos can’t believe this, can he? The primitive nature of technology was made less so by – yes – the unequal. His son Evan knows China very well, which means Osnos pere must know how tragically awful life was like in China before the mass production of market goods by the unequal. Inequality as a pejorative is beneath both ideologies.  Osnos hits Trump hard here and there, which he probably felt he had to given his audience. Ok, it’s understandable, we’ve all got flocks to feed, but there’s a veiled attempt to blame him for the coronavirus? Oh, come on. The consumer of news that Osnos is must be aware of Ron Klain’s assertion that the Obama administration was woefully unprepared for H1N1, and that if the virus had been a real killer, 50 to 60 million Americans would have died. To be clear, the latter is not a dig at Obama. It’s instead a dig at the notion that the politically skilled should have virus strategies. Such a view insults the Constitution, and also reason.  So while Trump has Osnos a bit downcast, he ends his great book on a happy note. Indeed, left out of this review (Tunku Varadarajan already covered it in his typically excellent account of A View) is where Osnos came from, of his amazingly resilient parents and brave older brother escaping untold Nazi horrors in Poland ahead of reaching the United States. Osnos was born in India as they made their way to the U.S., a journey that ended with prosperity of the Beresford (look it up) variety in Manhattan. What a story. Osnos knows it. As he puts it in the book’s penultimate sentence, “If the human race, for all it has been through over the millennia, were not resilient, we certainly would not have gotten this far.” Amen.  How could anyone, least of all Osnos, be at all pessimistic about Trump, Joe Biden or anyone else in consideration of his late brother’s, or his parents’ remarkable triumphs against massively more imposing odds (Jozef and Marta Osnos started over in Manhattan at the respective ages of 41 and 38) in a much crueler world? Our problems are so small today (regardless of ideology) relative to the way that the world was when Osnos was born. Which is where I’ll leave it. Though we don’t share the same political views, I’m even more optimistic about the present and future precisely because people like Peter Osnos live in the United States.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2021/09/08/book-review-peter-osnoss-occasionally-frustrating-but-wildly-engrossing-an-especially-good-view/,"Book Review: Peter Osnos’s Occasionally Frustrating, But Wildly Engrossing ‘An Especially Good View’"

[+] 22, J-Hope, Suga, V, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, RM of BTS perform onstage for the 2020 American Music Awards on November 22, 2020 in South Korea. (Photo by Big Hit Entertainment/AMA2020/Getty Images via Getty Images) BTS are in charge of the Hot 100 yet again as their seasonal smash, the newly-crowned Song of the Summer, finds its way back to No. 1 on the all-encompassing singles chart. The tune improves from No. 7 to the summit after the band re-released the former champion with new lyrics by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. The title also holds as the bestselling in the U.S. this frame, as many fans purchased a copy of the latest edition of the cut, as well as the original and other remixes released by BTS. Billboard combines every version of a song with the same title into one entity for charting purposes, and this week all the different takes on “Butter” have added up into one massive sales success for the group. “Butter” sold 143,000 copies in the past tracking week, which is far and away enough to keep it at No. 1 on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales chart. The tune has now held in that position for months, but this latest frame is special. Having already sold more than one million copies, “Butter” earns the second-largest sales week of 2021 this time around, and it outpaces every other title by an enormous margin. This week’s second-bestselling song, Walker Hayes’ “Fancy Like,” sold a very respectable 30,000 copies, which is impressive in today’s all-streaming music economy. While the country musician should be proud of his showing, BTS’s “Butter” does outsell the catchy tune more than four and a half times over. “Butter” was so popular in the past tracking frame, it actually managed to outsell the rest of the tracks that appear inside the top 10 on this week’s Digital Song Sales chart combined. In fact, when the sales figures of the next nine bestselling tunes are added up together, BTS’s current win still outsells that lump sum by more than 46,000 copies—a margin larger than any other title managed to move this frame. The rest of the top 10 on this week’s Digital Song Sales chart includes hit singles like The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s “Stay” (No. 3, 13,500 copies sold), Ed Sheeran’s “Bad Habits” (No. 4, 12,000), Nelly and Florida Georgia Line’s “Lil Bit” (No. 10, 6,000) and even BTS’s other single, “Permission to Dance” (No. 7, 6,500), which debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 several weeks ago, interrupting the winning streak “Butter” was enjoying at the time. “Butter” nearly outsold the rest of the tracks inside the top 20 on the Digital Song Sales chart combined, but doesn’t quite hit that mark. BTS’s “Butter” has now led the Digital Song Sales chart for 14 nonconsecutive weeks, and it could easily add to that total in the coming frames. The tune is already the fourth-longest-running leader of all time on the purchase-only tally, and it may soon advance on that ranking.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/btss-butter-outsold-the-rest-of-the-top-10-bestselling-songs-in-america-this-week-combined/,BTS’s ‘Butter’ Outsold The Rest Of The Top 10 Bestselling Songs In America This Week Combined
"A Florida judge ruled Wednesday the state’s ban on school mask mandates cannot remain in effect while litigation against it plays out—the second time he’s blocked the policy—one in a string of court rulings nationwide striking down state policies that restrict school districts from imposing mask mandates, at least temporarily. Students wearing face masks arrive on the first day of classes at Baldwin Park Elementary School in ... [+] Orlando, Florida, on August 10.  Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper issued his ruling Wednesday allowing schools to enact mask mandates while the lawsuit over whether the state's ban is legal plays out in appeals court. Arkansas was the first state to have its ban on mask mandates struck down in early August, after parents brought a lawsuit against it and even Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he now regrets enacting the ban on mask mandates in schools. Oklahoma’s ban on school mask mandates was temporarily suspended in early September until another hearing can take place, though the judge said schools must let parents opt their children out of the mask orders if they so choose. Tennessee’s executive order against school mask mandates, which required schools to let parents opt out of them, was temporarily struck down in federal court Friday as a judge ruled the policy violated students’ rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Texas voluntarily paused its school mask mandate ban in mid-August while litigation against the state policy plays out, after several court rulings struck down the policy as it applied to specific districts. School mask mandate bans still remain in effect in Montana, Iowa, South Carolina, Utah and Arizona, where the government is enforcing its ban despite it not officially taking effect until September 29. In contrast to the rulings striking down the mask mandate bans, the South Carolina Supreme Court has upheld that state’s policy and struck down the city of Columbia’s school mask mandate last week. That ruling narrowly applied to Columbia’s schools, however, and a second lawsuit against the policy is still pending. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said in a statement Wednesday it intends to file an emergency motion to reinstate the stay on Cooper’s ruling, which would once again ban school mask mandates if it’s successful. In addition to the states that have already issued rulings on the school mask mandate bans, lawsuits are also playing out in Iowa, Utah and Arizona that could result in those states’ policies getting either overturned or upheld. The U.S. Department of Education has opened civil rights investigations into states where bans on the mask mandates remain in effect, which could result in them facing potential punishments including prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice. Cooper’s ruling Wednesday came after the Florida judge had already previously issued a preliminary injunction against the state’s school mask mandate ban, though it was almost immediately reversed as the state appealed Cooper’s ruling and triggered an automatic stay that put the ban back in effect. Cooper then struck down that stay on Wednesday, blocking the mask mandate ban for a second time. State-level policies against school mask mandates have become a particular source of contention as a new school year starts amid the delta variant surge, which has left children ineligible for Covid-19 vaccines particularly vulnerable. In addition to the legal challenges, a slew of school districts in most of the states with mask mandate bans have revolted against the state policies by enacting mask mandates anyway, leading some states to threaten consequences against those who do so. Florida withheld funding from the first two school districts in the state that imposed mask requirements and has moved forward with punishments against other districts—at least before Cooper blocked the ban Wednesday—though that has not dissuaded districts from keeping their mandates in effect. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has also said the state will withhold federal funding from school districts that have mask mandates in place, though the Biden administration has encouraged school districts in Arizona and other states to keep their mask mandates in place. The White House has said districts can use other federal funds allocated to them to make up for any funding cuts they may face from their state governments.

"A New York federal judge sentenced Nancy Salzman — who helped lead NXIVM alongside founder Keith Raniere — to 3.5 years in prison on a racketeering charge Wednesday, the latest prison term for a high-ranking member of a purported self-help group that was as an exploitative sex cult. Nancy Salzman arrives at Brooklyn federal court on March 13, 2019. Judge Nicholas Garaufis hit Salzman with 42 months of prison time and a $150,000 fine, and she agreed to forfeit cash and other assets, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn said in a Wednesday afternoon press release. Salzman pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy in 2019, after prosecutors accused Salzman — also known as “Prefect” — of serving as NXIVM’s president, conspiring to commit identity theft and planning to surveil the group’s perceived opponents. Federal prosecutors asked Garaufis to impose a sentence “on the high end” of 33 to 41 months, stating in a memo last month that Salzman “enabled Raniere to maintain his position as the leader of a criminal enterprise and gain access to his victims.” Salzman’s attorneys asked for two years of home confinement, claiming she accepts responsibility for her actions but was exploited and controlled by Raniere. Several other high-level NXIVM members have already been sentenced. Raniere was given 120 years in prison last October for racketeering, sex trafficking and other charges. Actress Alison Mack was sentenced to three years in prison in June, Clare Bronfman, heiress to the multibillion-dollar Seagram’s fortune, was given 81 months of prison time last year, and Salzman’s daughter Lauren was sentenced to five years of probation in July, dodging prison time after she cooperated with prosecutors. Raniere founded NXIVM in the 1990s, offering expensive self-help classes and executive coaching sessions to thousands of people. A former nurse, Salzman served as Raniere’s longtime business partner after meeting him in 1997. But Raniere and his associates were later accused of recruiting women into a secret cult-like organization within NXIVM called DOS, in which members — referred to as “slaves” — were coerced into having sex with Raniere, branded with Raniere’s initials and blackmailed if they threatened to leave. Federal authorities charged and arrested Raniere in March 2018, and several months later, other NXIVM insiders — including Mack, Salzman and Bronfman — also faced charges. Forbes was among the first media outfits that raised questions about NXIVM in 2003 when it quoted Bronfman’s father — billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr. — saying, “I think it’s a cult,” after his two daughters, Sara and Clare, became involved in the group.

"Twitter announced Wednesday it would be testing out a new feature called “Communities” — which allows people to join groups based on their interests and tweet directly to them on those topics, similar to how Facebook Groups or a Reddit subreddit works — the latest move by the company to grow its audience after other failed ventures like Fleets. PARIS, FRANCE - FEBRUARY 07: In this photo illustration the Twitter logo is displayed on the screen ... [+] of an iPhone in front of a computer screen displaying a Twitter logo on February 07, 2019 in Paris, France. Twitter today posted better than expected Wall Street results over the last three months of 2018, with net profit up 28% and revenue up 4%, but the stock is falling. After losing 5 million monthly users by the end of 2018, the social network Twitter decided to stop giving figures. In its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018, the company explains that this announcement will take effect in the second quarter of 2019. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) People who have Apple IOS devices will be able to access the feature through a tab at the bottom of the app, but Android users will have to wait, and a date hasn’t been announced yet when it will be available to them. Only a few Twitter Communities, on topics like dogs, weather, sneakers, skin care and astrology, are available at launch, but the company said it expects more will be created every week. Each Twitter Community will have moderators that are able to add people to the group, and anyone within the group will be able to tweet directly to other people in the Community instead of tweeting to their followers. Tweets within the Community feature are not private and anyone outside a Community will be able to view tweets in the group. Those who are interested in creating their own Community will be able to fill out an interest form on the company’s website, and Twitter said it would “build and update” the Community feature with the public’s feedback.  “There’s always been a broad, weird and wonderful range of conversations on Twitter, but we haven’t done enough to help connect people who are into the same things. And now, that’s changing.” Twitter staff project manager David Regan wrote Wednesday.  Twitter initially teased the release of the Community feature in February, along with Super Follows, which launched last week and allows Twitter users to charge people to gain access to additional content. Twitter said at the time that their goal is to expand to 315 million monetizable daily active users and reach $7.5 billion annual revenue by the end of 2023, according to CNBC. So far, the company said it is on track with adding users, with the company reporting in its latest earnings call a growth in the number of monetizable daily active users by 11%, following the launch of Super Follows. However, the platform has overall struggled to grow its user base over the past few years, even though it has seen occasional upticks in traffic. During the first quarter of this year, Twitter reported 199 million monetizable daily active users, just shy of  expectations of 200 million. This resulted in an 11% downturn in the company’s stock value.  Twitter has also stumbled on releasing new features to attract more users. It launched Fleets in November, a mirror to the popular Instagram and Snapchat stories, but ended up removing the feature eight months after launch, saying that it ultimately was not popular among users. Toxic and abusive tweets have also been a constant problem on the platform, leading some users like social media personality Chrissy Teigen to leave temporarily, and pushing Twitter to release new tools to give users control over who mentions them.

"Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas), two ringleaders of a protest in which House Republicans refused to comply with the House’s mask mandate, have each been fined for going maskless on the House floor, an ethics panel said Wednesday. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 24: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) (R) talks to U.S. Rep. Chip Roy ... [+] (R-TX) outside the House Chambers at the U.S. Capitol on August 24, 2021 in Washington, DC. The House passed the $3.5 trillion budget framework and is expected to take up the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act later tonight. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Greene and Roy were both fined by the House Sergeant-at-Arms for going maskless in the House chamber on August 2 and did not file appeals, the House Ethics Committee said in a pair of statements on Wednesday. House Republicans have railed against Capitol Physician Brian Monahan’s decision in late July to reimpose the mandate, which had been fully lifted the previous month, with dozens eschewing masks on the House floor in late July and early August. Greene previously received a $500 fine in May for violating the mask mandate a second time, which was upheld on appeal by the Ethics Committee, meaning she will be hit with a $2,500 fine for her third offense. Roy, who received a first-offense warning in May, is set to face a $500 fine, telling Forbes he didn’t appeal because “filing an appeal to tyrannical overlords is a futile gesture,” adding that it could leave him “without standing to sue, should the mood arise.” Forbes has reached out to Greene’s office for comment. Greene and Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) have filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to try to knock down the mask fines, arguing that the fact they are taken out of members’ paychecks is a violation of Constitution’s 27th Amendment, which says a law changing lawmakers’ pay cannot take effect until after an election.  Norman, who told Forbes in July he didn’t believe it was necessary for him to wear a mask because he was vaccinated and compared the mandate to requiring members to “dye our hair and wear blue socks,” tested positive for coronavirus a week later.  “Right now you’ve got individuals going out here having to take financial hits and some, you know, they have to figure that out. This is the tyranny of the fine,” Roy told Forbes in August after several Republicans backed down from their refusal to mask up on the floor amid the threat of fines.

"Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Himesh Patel, Cate Blanchett, Tyler Perry and Timothée Chalemet in Adam McKay's 'Don't Look Up' After a first trailer for their unofficial “tentpole/blockbuster” offering for late 2021 (Red Notice), Netflix just dropped a trailer for their unofficial Oscar mega-movie. The big hook for Don’t Look Up is, of course, the bonkers-sized cast. Not only does it star Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence , it has a cast that includes Meryl Streep, Johah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Cate Blanchett, Himesh Patel, Ron Perlman, Michael Chiklis, Kid Cudi and Ariana Grande.  Adam McKay directs and co-writes (along with longtime journalist/political wonk David Sirota) this comedy concerning the end of the world and the Earthlings who don’t seem to care. The plot concerns two low-level astrophysicists who stumble upon a planet-killing comet racing toward Earth and must embark on a worldwide media campaign to convince an indifferent or disbelieving public to plan accordingly.  The climate change metaphor probably won’t be subtle, but I think humanity (or at least those with the levers of power) proved a long time ago that subtly doesn’t work. Sure, this could end up just preaching to the converted, as is likely the fate of any politically-specific work in our fragmented, “art for any and all viewpoints” pop culture, but that won’t matter if enough casual Netflix subscribers watch (almost certainly) and if the film is good enough to appeal to awards season voters.  As for the trailer, it’s a remarkably efficient tease. Running just 69 second, the film implicitly announces “Netflix has Leo now too!,” with DiCaprio (still the last remaining butts-in-seats movie star) breathing heavily and acting panicked at being “here.” It then launches into a visual roll call of the all-star ensemble, with teases of halfway decent production values and just enough of the core plot (“there’s a comet heading to Earth but nobody cares”) to make the sell.  In terms of getting the job done, this is a perfect teaser and we probably don’t even need another plot-spoiling trailer. The film will play theatrically starting December 10, which is the same day as Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story. That is a little ironic as Spielberg tried to get major theater chains to play streaming Oscar contenders, comments that were widely misinterpreted as the filmmaker having a bias against streaming platforms. It’ll debut on Netflix on December 24.  I can’t imagine it not being one of Netflix’s biggest (in terms of global household viewership) original movies ever by default. I’d say “I hope it’s better than Vice,” but the Annapurna-released Dick Cheney biopic did snag eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, so...

"Orange Glou Founder Doreen Winkler What makes orange wines great and why do they have their own store? Sommelier Doreen Winkler has the answers to the first question and is the answer to the second. After moving to the United States from her native Germany, and working at Michelin-starred restaurants Aska and Aldea, Winkler discovered her love for orange wines and began her own Orange Glou wine subscription club. The club's success has now led to the opening of her own Orange Glou Wine Store in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I spoke with Winker about the latest addition to her orange wine empire. How did you discover orange wines? I was working with traditional wines until 2012-13 when I dabbled in natural wines and never wanted to go back. I got to work with Chef Fredrik Berselius at Aska and he was the person to tell me he wanted the wine list to be 100% natural. Pairing the food there was challenging but when you got it right you felt amazing.  From working with only natural wines, I then fell in love with orange wines. And for years that's all I wanted to drink in my time off. It's all I wanted to do more research on. After Aska I started consulting. I worked with Sel Rrose and we put 25 orange wines on the list, and three by the glass, and people were very enthusiastic. And then I had an idea — it would be crazy for someone to start an orange wine subscription. So I did it. I started Orange Glou in 2019.  What is orange wine? The way I explain it: they are wines made from white grapes that are kept on the skins during fermentation. From this method there are so many colors that happen — every grape is different. How does the skin contact change the wine? I would say it's white wine on steroids. A lot more flavors. Different textures. They may be light but with grippy tannins, or velvety or even silky. Everything is possible. I just had a Sauvignon Blanc with flavors of Meyer lemon, sea salt and mushroom. It's extreme in a good way. And so many exciting things are happening, including new techniques like taking a Gruner Veltliner and macerating it on Riesling skins.  What made you decide to go from a wine club to opening a store? I realized how much I loved this project with the wine club and the store was the perfect way to continue and make it bigger. I knew what I wanted to do and when I looked at the space I knew I wanted it to be there.  What can people expect at the store? Right now we have over 50 wines and we're going to 75. We'll have 100 eventually. We have Pét-Nat orange bubbles, and the sections go from lighter-bodied to medium to full-bodied so it's easy for anyone to manage. The wines are from all over the world. We have lots from the Czech Republic, Georgia, all over Europe, New Zealand and Australia and the United States.  How should someone select their first bottle? Sign up for the club! It offers all kinds of wines across the spectrum. And we always have a sparkling. We provide information on the wines, which is important if you want to learn more. At the store we also do tastings every Friday from 5-7PM, and brunch wines on Sunday from 1-3PM. We also ship to 44 states.  Orange wines are made by many small producers. Does the store have a rotating stock? These wines are hard to source and it's about appreciating that. Sometimes I only get six bottles, sometimes twelve. Sometimes people want to order a case and I have to tell them that all I have is one case. A lot of people have seen that every week some things are gone, but there is something else to try. And I like that, because there's so many good things to showcase. To me that's exciting to always have something new to drink.  Are orange wines more expensive? We start at $19 and go up to $99 - and if that $19 wasn't good then it wouldn't be in the store. We have a very good selection with a lot of thought behind it.  How has the reception been to the store? I see more positivity. When we launched there were some negative comments on Instagram, one even posting my picture and calling me crazy. But people are very interested. Overall the response has been great. I have regulars coming in after only being open a month and a half. Neighbors have also come by and shown their support.  What do you see in the future for orange wine? There's more and more being made. I see a lot of things happening around the world. I'm excited about the Czech Republic. And low-alcohol wines. There are definitely some winemakers only trying to make money from the trend, but then they fail with quality. It's for me to decide if they are good enough to get into the store.  Orange Glou Wine Store is located at 264 Broome Street in New York, and the Orange Wine Club offers 3 and 6-bottle subscriptions as well one-time boxes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammorganstern/2021/09/08/orange-wines-take-the-spotlight-at-new-yorks-newest-wine-store-orange-glou/,Orange Wines Take The Spotlight At New York’s Newest Wine Store: Orange Glou
"American Airlines pilots at controls in cockpit  Restive American 
  
  AAL 
  Airlines pilots, unhappy with the carrier’s occasional summer operations breakdowns, are planning airport demonstrations in Dallas and Miami and, in Philadelphia, are calling for management resignations. On Tuesday, the Philadelphia domicile of the Allied Pilots Association approved a resolution advocating that “the upper management team who control the American Airlines operation be replaced with a more competent group.” Also Tuesday, the union’s board authorized informational picketing in Miami and Dallas, saying “management has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to run a reliable airline.” The Miami demonstration is scheduled for October 19 with subsequent events in Dallas and possibly Charlotte. Paul DiOrio, chairman of the Philadelphia pilot domicile, said Wednesday, “Our resolution is based on airline operations. This summer was bad for both our paying passengers and our pilots and it wasn't the first time. They've had over seven years to get this right (since the 2013 American/US Airways merger) and the pilots have had enough with this team’s inability to get the operation to function as it should. ""There comes a point at any job when you’re not performing and it may be time for a change” DiOrio said.  American’s summer operating performance has been mixed. APA spokesman Dennis Tajer called it “brand damaging. “They were good when there were clear summer skies, but when there was any adversity due to weather, they couldn’t connect enough pilots to the airplanes,” Tajer said. American cancelled hundreds of flights over Father’s Day weekend. Subsequently, during an early August recovery from bad weather in Dallas, “More than 60,000 passengers were impacted by cancellations, with nearly 75% of the cancelled flights attributed to management’s failure to connect pilots to airplanes,” according to the board’s message to pilots. APA represents about 14,000 pilots. The Philadelphia domicile represents about 900 pilots. The APA board has 20 members including two from Philadelphia. The board will decide at its October meeting whether to back the Philadelphia resolution. American declined to comment specifically on the pilot actions, but in a September 3rd letter to pilots, Chip Long, vice president of flight, offered thanks for “the professionalism and commitment you’ve shown this summer as we experienced the largest operational ramp-up in our company’s history.” Long said American had “a challenging stretch in June due to weather, vendor staffing and temporary pilot training challenges.” But he noted that during the third quarter, operating performance was comparable to previous years.  Long responded specifically to pilot issues, including concerns that poor scheduling led to excessive last-minute demands to fly beyond scheduled trips because reserve pilots were not immediately available. “Relative to the size of our schedule, we had more active pilots than previous summers,” Long wrote. “Our cancellations due to pilot availability were down 30%.” In a Labor Day Instagram message to employees, American CEO Doug Parker wrote, “As I think back over the past 18 months on this Labor Day, I can’t help but feel an overwhelming amount of gratitude for our incredible AA team and their union leaders who have kept American Air running and the global economy turning during an unprecedented global pandemic.” The pilots’ contract became amendable in January 2020, but talks have preceded slowly. Tajer said American keeps about 30% of its pilots on reserve, compared to an industry average of about 15%. Tajer said that “American scheduling is unreliable when weather hits” and that reserve pilots aren’t given sufficient time to prepare for flights, placing a burden on pilots who have already scheduled lines of flying. He said pilots who fly into the Charlotte hub frequently are reassigned at the last minute.  In their resolution, Philadelphia pilots noted, that “Since 2016, American Airlines upper middle management has driven our Department of Transportation operational reliability (on-time /cancellation rate), passenger complaint rate and lost bags rate to the bottom or a near bottom ranking among our competitors.”  They noted that in 2017, the APA board passed a resolution saying it had lost confidence in Parker and his management team, and that American operations have worsened since then.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2021/09/08/american-airlines-pilots-decry-poor-summer-operations-as-philly-pilots-call-for-new-management/,American Airlines Pilots Decry Poor Summer Operations As Philly Pilots Call For New Management
"Joe Biden proclaimed to the nation that “I was not going to extend this forever war,” referring to the tw0-decade campaign in Afghanistan. To some, the episode brought less apparent benefit to the nation as opposed to the defense, consulting and speaking-circuit class. The opposing army is now implausibly regarded as partners in the evacuation of Americans. Yet even now it may not be prudent to believe the overseas adventures have actually ended given sticky presidential authorizations to use force.  WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 14: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and U.S. President Joe Biden ... [+] speak briefly to reporters as they arrive at the U.S. Capitol for a Senate Democratic luncheon July 14, 2021 in Washington, DC. President Biden is on the Hill to discuss with Senate Democrats the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package they have reached overnight that would expand Medicare benefits, boost federal safety net programs and combat climate change. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) But futile trillion-dollar military and nation-building campaigns, and even the old-school “Wars” on Drugs and Crime, just scratch the surface. The real “Forever War” story is the bouquet of domestic ones that Biden and congressional allies are waging in 2021 that will mean unprecedented spending on and regulation of American’s daily lives, in perpetuity.  Biden’s American Rescue Plan already passed in March. If fulfilled during September’s hectic legislative calendar, a trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure package, plus some iteration of Biden’s American Jobs Plan, American Families Plan and “build back better” $3.5 trillion amalgamation will represent the fulfillment of a grand domestic “Forever War” declaration, an achievement that its proponents chillingly call a “generational transformation.” This fusion of long-sought progressive pet programs will sideline the remnants of limited government and engage autopilot on spending and regulation in pursuit of big infrastructure, big mass transit, big climate, big renewable energy, big “homeland security,” big cybersecurity, big health care, and most prominently, big-time healthy-adult dependency on government not just during crisis but boom times.  Domestic Forever Wars can perhaps best be defined as spending and creation of federal power centers where there's no intention to actually solve a crisis or a problem, but to enrich the bureaucratic and contractor class and create vast amounts of make-work. Victory will never be declared. The most prominent motivator today is the establishment of able-bodied adult dependency on government and all the spending, social regulation and surveillance that the endless pursuit of an unattainable ""equity"" this and related pursuits will entail.  Indeed the Biden legislative “triad” and sloganeering seem to epitomize the pursuit of a custodial administrative state and social regulatory interventions. These are reinforced in executive orders such as those on minimum wage increases for contractors; nondiscrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation (including the creation of a White House Gender Policy Council); racial equity and support for underserved communities; diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the federal workforce; and refugee resettlement and ""Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration.""  Virtually every part of the federal bureaucracy now has an iron in the “build back better” fire. The Environmental Protection Agency just this month issued an astonishing, paternalistic press release on the “disproportionate impacts of climate change” and how ""the most severe harms” “fall disproportionately upon underserved communities."" This is hard to take for somebody whose Dad grew up in a house with no toilet, tub, shower or running water apart from a single sink in what could loosely be called a kitchen. Yet the EPA proclamation happened within a week of over 200 medical journals calling climate change the “greatest threat to global public health,” a claim dutifully and uncritically reported by the likes of the New York Times and NPR.  So the political class can count on media support of domestic Forever Wars, whether in never-ending pursuit of lowering the temperature or keeping us all equal. Emblematic of the times is that all this this new “spendulus” is demanded even in the face of the rumblings of inflation, and even as recovery — economically and health-wise — is arguably already well underway if government can keep its hands to itself.  Naturally, intra- and inter-party squabbles are underway over the way to fuse the bipartisan infrastructure package and Biden’s $3.5 trillion amalgam given a looming government funding deadline and need to raise the overall debt ceiling, a default on which will cause big problems in October. Senate finance committee chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) called what is seen as Biden’s signature package a “heavier lift” than the earlier American Rescue Plan. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) is allegedly insisting upon holding the price tag of Biden’s agenda down to as little as $1 trillion, but this is theater as far as big-picture progressivism is concerned. Even if Manchin taps the brakes, the foundations of these new domestic Forever Wars will be solidly anchored if Republicans fail to derail the whole works. While Manchin will be a media distraction and Beltway sensation as such things go, it makes no substantive difference if progressives only get half the dollars in 2021 but 100% of Biden’s ""human infrastructure"" concrete is metaphorically and philosophically poured.  This is the environment within which Republicans contemplate compromise with Democrats on so-called infrastructure, in a nation already $28 trillion in the hole. They’d best beware; Democrats’ imperative now is to get Republican fingerprints on the debt limit increase, despite McConnell's pledge letter with 45 other Republicans warning they wouldn’t play ball and help with the increase where Democrats insist upon their spending agenda. A showdown is being engineered, but Democrats can combine their $3.5 trillion package with the debt ceiling increase without a single Republican vote in September 2021 using the same reconciliation processe mechanics to avoid a supermajority requirement that they used to pass the American Rescue Plan back in March. They can do it alone, but the Treasury Secretary’s is likely to have their back on blaming Republicans anyway.  Whatever happens during the showdown, Democrats likely suspect that, just as the old promises to repeal Obamacare won’t actually happen, they'll be able to count on Republican support of the newfangled and open-ended spending plans after a couple election cycles. It’s already largely forgotten that the gargantuan Biden spending proposal appears in the wake of House and Senate debates over a misguided bipartisan “Endless Frontier Act” on alleged science and tech investment that will amount to endless regulation instead. While there was some solid philosophical pushback on the Biden budget resolution package this summer from Sen. Mike Lee, Sen. Rick Scott and Sen. Ron Johnson — calling it the “mother of all inflation bombs” — more typical of the caucus is Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s fretting that Biden’s taxing and spending would “shortchange” the woke military that McConnell himself should be shortchanging.  The torrent of legislation in 2020 and 2021 represents the kind of interventions dubbed “super-statutes,” whose scale results in societal and cultural changes. While regulatory in the extreme, much of the Covid- and Biden-era intervention and distortions on top of the spending and wealth transfers, will escape the cost-benefit analysis ostensibly applied to the regulatory state. The regulatory costs of blurring government and business roles in society are incalculable.  Indeed there’s plenty debate over trickle-down economics, but not enough over downpour spending and regulation. In this year marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy and the launch of the forever war just terminated, it’s also been 20 years since the federal books were balanced. There’s no hint of that happening again anytime soon, nor is there even interest apparent in taking obvious steps like “withdrawing troops,” so to speak, from the domestic grant programs now topping $700 billion annually and leaving the dollars in the states, and shrinking the federal enterprise that way. Be that as it may, the economic recovery imperative that makes even the likes of Manchin nervous imply that now is an appropriate time to reckon with Washington’s regulatory tentacles with a growth by deregulation alternative to domestic Forever War spending.  It’s a tall order, but, on the other hand, regulation is the “other national debt” and addressing it can contribute to easing today’s fiscal problems as well as, to borrow a phrase, build back better without the destruction inflicted by futile domestic social regulatory war footings. A major recent implementation of that notion, now obliterated, was former president Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back regulation to ease pandemic coping and recovery.  It’s still not too late for Republicans to scrap the bipartisan infrastructure error that remains a pillar of the misguided September spending agenda and replace it with deregulation such as breaking down of the regulatory silos between infrastructure sectors artificially sustained by bureaucratic agencies, privatization of government programs, abolition of antitrust, and other liberalization to maximize the private sector’s freedom to build new infrastructure wealth and jobs. Everything happening in 2021 creates new strings and regulations instead.  Capping federal spending is important, but so too is capping private regulatory compliance spending. Granted, cutting rather than growing regulation is just as much a non-starter as spending restraint under Biden. Nonetheless somewhere there needs to emerge stirrings of a movement, not for domestic Forever Wars benefiting the Washington “generals,” but one that enables Americans to help themselves and their families to flourish independently of Washington in daily livees, and to provide for their own secure retirements and health care and to pass down intergenerational wealth instead of intergenerational federal debt. Among those still carrying the torch is the aforementioned Sen. Rick Scott (R-Florida) with his ""Unnecessary Agency Regulations Reduction Act to “reduce burdensome government regulations and more efficiently dispose of outdated, duplicative or unnecessary agency regulations.” This bill would have OMB compile an inventory of major regulations planned, take into account the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) assessment of unnecessary duplication, and engage Congress in the task eliminating multiple executive branch regulations simultaneously via joint resolution.    While insistence on a balanced budget in exchange for debt limit concessions is also a dead letter, steps in that direction need to be part of the discourse. In the current debate, it is worth recalling an idea proposed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and then-Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) back in 2017 dubbed the Reducing Excessive Government Act (or REG Act). A regulatory bill that uniquely addressed debt limit increase concerns, the proposal would have made debt ceiling increases contingent upon proportional cuts in regulatory costs. The REG Act stipulated that for any debt limit increase or suspension, the ""direct cost of Federal regulation"" must be cut by at least 15 percent over the subsequent ten year period. According to a one-pager at the time, for example, if ""Congress raises the debt limit by $1 trillion, the REG Act would require a reduction in regulatory costs of $150 billion."" The REG Act would have instructed the aforementioned GAO to report on which rules cost the economy over $100 million annually. Congress would take that information into account in consideration of a package of cuts that would be privileged and voted on via an expedited process. Importantly, if the rule cuts don't pass, a ""snapback"" would tamp down the debt limit increase, freezing things, thereby forcing the issue of regulatory cuts.  Moves like the REG Act are vital, but only for when and if a return to normalcy occurs. Doing it now, not that it matters since the bill never passed, would be out of the question since it would enable rather than halt the grand domestic forever war schemes underway, putting greasy Republican fingerprints all over an unprecedented underlying escalation of government’s scope. Separately, Sen. Lee already had for years sponsored the most prominent ""regulatory budgeting"" proposal to limit agency compliance costs affecting the private sector. So the makings for sanity are out there when their time comes.  I noted how Biden's legislative triad, the infrastructure package, and build back better are all blurring together. The same may occur with the overseas and domestic planks of Forever Wars. When all is said and done, the Pentagon hasn't lost anything leaving Afghanistan because it agrees with the rest of the progressive cohort that climate action is of paramount importance and has declared climate change a national security priority.  If the progressives won’t stop not wasting crises, as the cliche demands, they need to be forced to. It took decades to pull out of an overseas Forever War. This year will show whether we can avoid declaring destructive new domestic ones.

"Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, and Mapuana Makia star in ""Doogie Kamealoha, M.D."" Another teenage wonder doc has arrived.   In the ‘90s, it was Doogie Howser, M.D. and now it’s Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.   The original series is about a teenage genius who’s participating in a demanding medical residency. Neil Patrick Harris starred in the title role.  This new version, set in Hawaii and featuring an indigenous family, stars Peyton Elizabeth Lee as the new Doogie, (real name: Lahela). The new Doogie is taking the same path as the original; thrust into an adult world as she pursues her medical education while still a teenager.  The creative team includes showrunner Kourtney Kang, as well executive producer Melvin Mar, executive producer Dayna Bochco, executive producer and director Jake Kasdan, and executive producer and director Jesse Bochco.  Mar, talking about the origin of the series, says, “Towards the end of [working on] Fresh Off the Boat, I was talking to [the studio] about another show we can do that featured an Asian American lead. Off of this, the studio put Mar in touch with the Bochco family, whose late patriarch, Steven Bochco, was the creator and showrunner for Doogie Howser, M.D. Bochco’s widow and producing partner, Dayna Bochco, gave Mar the okay to move forward. Then he called up Kang and the two pitched their update to the Bochcos who agreed to collaborate on the new version.  Kang, who says that she grew up watching the show and was a huge fan, said the very important first question was, “How do we call her Doogie?” Explaining how the team worked this out, she says, “I had the idea of ‘what if this reboot takes place in our world, where Doogie Howser is a beloved show from the '90s and it's apparently is a thing that happens sometimes to young doctors - they get nicknamed Doogie.’” They also thought it would be fun for Lahela to have this nickname that she doesn’t really understand because it’s from a time when she wasn’t even born yet.   “It just seemed like a fun way to approach it,” says Kang.    Lee admits that when she first got the audition for the series she wasn’t familiar with the original series, but she says that her parents were excited because they loved the show. It was then that she sat down and started watching the ‘90s version.  Actor Neil Patrick Harris poses for a portrait on the set of "" Doogie Howser, M.D"" in circa 1989. ... [+] (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) Kang had wanted to connect Lee’s Doogie with Neil Patrick Harris’ Doogie in the first season, but due to the pandemic it just couldn’t happen. Now she’s hopeful that it will take place during season two.  Lee says that it’s interesting for her to play Lahela because she’s complex and has many layers. She leaned on Kang to craft her portrayal because, “this show really is a reflection of her life and her experience growing up, so it was very important for me to know her story and be able to keep the spirit of her journey alive.” In the role, Lee has to rattle off complicated medical terms believably, which is an extremely important element of the series, she says. “That was one of the biggest challenges for me, because in order to buy into the show, you really have to buy into this idea of a teenage doctor. So, it wasn't just about memorizing these medical monologues but about knowing what I was saying and what all these words meant so that it felt very truthful.” Along those same lines, Dayna Bochco admits that she was a tad worried about putting together a reboot of any of her husband’s series, because, ‘he was such a special artist,’ but she loved the idea of working with Mar, Kang and Kasdan.  “They're so talented,” she says, adding, “It was like, ‘oh, Steven would love these people.’ So, we felt very confident going forward because they were always so respectful of what he had done and also respectful of the ideas behind the concept [of] the child prodigy, the kid that doesn't fit in either world. They got that all day long.” Jesse Bochco adds that his father was not one to really want a reboot, but that, “Peyton blew our faces off, and in literally the last days of my dad's life ‑‑ he said, ‘You've got to do [this]. He said, ‘You have something here so go do it.’ And it really focused me in a different way [to do this].” Lee is clear that you don’t have to have watched the original series to appreciate and understand the new version. “But, if you have seen the original, there are all of these little Easter eggs and all of these little times where we pay homage to the original [to] keep the spirit of the [that] alive.” A few of the nods to the ‘90s version of the series include the theme music, which is basically the same riff but with a Hawaiian twist, and each episode ends with the main character journaling about lessons learned as the original Doogie did. Lee says that most important thing she brings to Doogie Kamealoha, M.D. is her ‘youthful excitement about the series, because, “This is my dream and getting to live it is all I’ve ever hoped for.” ‘Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.’  streams on Disney+ weekly every Wednesday.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/anneeaston/2021/09/08/90s-series-doogie-howser-md-gets-a-female-lead-and-a-hawaiian-twist-in-new-series/,"‘90s Series ‘Doogie Howser, M.D.’ Gets A Female Lead And A Hawaiian Twist In New Series"
"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was “well aware” that her company’s blood testing machines couldn’t perform as advertised but continued to go to great lengths to deceive investors and the public, modifying third-party devices and even producing a doctored report from Pfizer, a federal prosecutor said in the opening statements of her fraud trial on Wednesday.  Elizabeth Holmes walks into the federal courthouse for her trial in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, ... [+] Sept. 8, 2021. Holmes is accused of duping elite financial backers, customers and patients into believing that her startup was about to revolutionize medicine. If convicted by a jury in San Jose, California, she could be sentenced to 20 years in prison. (AP Photo/Nic Coury) U.S. Attorney Robert Leach traced the case back to 2009, when he says Holmes was becoming desperate as companies like Pfizer began declining partnerships with Theranos and she was running out of funding, according to reporters from NPR and Law360 inside the courtroom.  “Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” Leach said, explaining that she went on to sell the idea of Theranos’ miniature blood testing devices to Safeway and Walgreens though the FDA was “nowhere near” approving them and Theranos was instead relying on machines made by a competitor.  In addition to exaggerating the capabilities of Theranos’ proprietary technology, Holmes grossly misrepresented the company’s revenue, a contract it had with the U.S. military and shepherded through “false and misleading” articles in the media, Leach said.  The prosecutor also stated Holmes ordered her subordinates to modify third-party machines “to deceive Walgreens and Safeway” and once handed investors a forged report from Pfizer claiming Theranos’ devices had “superior performance.”  The false claims were driven by Theranos’ repeated financial struggles, Leach said, noting that the company was burning through $1 million to $2 million per week in 2013 with just $15 million left in cash.  Leach said the prosecution will call up ex-Theranos employees who saw problems with the blood tests, as well as multiple patients who were given incorrect test results, including a man who was falsely led to believe he had prostate cancer and women with incorrect results about pregnancies.  “Elizabeth Holmes was well aware of these problems,” Leach said, adding that the “false and misleading statements were enormously successful.” “The defendant’s fraudulent scheme made her a billionaire. The scheme brought her fame, it bought her honor and it brought her adoration.”  Holmes’ defense team is set to present their opening statements later on Wednesday.  Holmes faces a total of 12 charges—two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 10 counts of wire fraud—for allegedly engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to deceive investors, doctors and patients from 2010 to 2016 alongside Theranos’ former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with whom she was romantically involved. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and hit with a $250,000 fine, in addition to restitution, for each count. Holmes and Balwani have both pleaded not guilty and are standing trial separately (Balwani’s trial is set to begin January 2022).  The trial, which is taking place at a federal court house in San Jose, is expected to last between three and four months, with a potential witness list featuring some of America’s most powerful politicians and businesspeople. Among those who could be called to the stand by the prosecution are former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was a Theranos board member, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, an investor. Holmes’ lawyers submitted a list of dozens of possible defense witnesses late Tuesday which included former employees, Food and Drug Administration officials and powerful board members like former CDC Director William Foege and former Senate Majority Leader William Frist. Holmes was also on the list as she may choose to testify.  “Board Members, Billionaires And A Journalist: Here’s Who Elizabeth Holmes’ Lawyers Could Call To Testify” (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/elizabeth-holmes-was-well-aware-of-theranos-problems-but-went-to-great-lengths-to-deceive-investors-prosecution-says/,"Elizabeth Holmes Was ‘Well Aware’ Of Theranos Problems But Went To Great Lengths To Deceive Investors, Prosecution Says"
"Emma Raducanu, of Great Britain, serves to Belinda Bencic, of Switzerland, during the quarterfinals ... [+] of the US Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Sept. 8, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) The teenagers keep winning at the U.S. Open. One day after Leylah Annie Fernandez, who turned 19 on Monday, stormed into the semifinals, 18-year-old Emma Raducanu followed her into the final four. Raducanu became the first qualifier — man or woman — to reach the semifinals with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Olympic gold medalist Belinda Bencic. She has now won eight straight matches without dropping a set — including three in qualifying — and will face No. 17 Maria Sakkari of Greece — who dominated No. 4 Karolina Pliskova, 6-4, 6-4 — in Thursday’s semifinals. Fernandez faces No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in the other semifinal Thursday night. The semifinalists will earn $675,000, the runner-up $1,250,000 and the winner $2.5 million. “Of course, playing Belinda, she’s such a great opponent and she’s in unbelievable form and her ball speed definitely caught me off guard,” Raducanu, born in Toronto to a Romanian father and a Chinese mother, told ESPN’s Rennae Stubbs on court. “She hits the ball so hard so I had to try and adjust and adapt and it was a really tough match for me. “I’m just so, so happy to have come through and thank you so much for all of your support today.” After falling behind 1-3, Raducanu began to dominate from the baseline and earned a break back as Bencic became unnerved. The Brit won five straight games to take the first set. She finished with six aces and 23 winners against 12 unforced errors. She then earned another break in the second set to become the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1983 to reach the semifinals and the fifth woman to make the semifinals in her debut. “I’m just trying to focus on what I can control, my serve, landing first serves and Belinda is an incredibly tough opponent so she was going to fight all the way until the end,” Raducanu said. “I’m just really pleased to have come through.” She said she took some inspiration from Fernandez, one of two Canadians in the semifinals along with Felix Auger-Aliassime. “To have so many young players that are doing so well just show how strong the next generation is, and Leyla is doing incredibly well,” she said. “She’s really nice, she was passing out cupcakes for her 19th birthday [Tuesday]. “Everyone’s on their own trajectory so I’m just here taking care of what I can control and it’s my own journey at the end of the day.” Emma Raducanu, of Great Britain, returns a shot to Belinda Bencic, of Switzerland, during the ...

"LOS ANGELES, CA - AUGUST 15: Indiana Fever Emma Cannon during the Indiana Fever versus the Los ... [+] Angeles Sparks WNBA game on August 15, 2021, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA. (Photo by Jevone Moore/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) The Indiana Fever have inked assertive forward Emma Cannon to a rest-of-season contract, the team announced on Monday. Cannon, a 32-year old power forward, has been with the Fever since the Olympic break concluded in mid-August. She signed a 7-day contract that began once the break ended, and she signed two additional 7-day deals with Indiana in the span between then and Monday. WNBA players aren’t permitted to sign more than three 7-day contracts with one team in a season, so once Cannon’s third week-long deal expired on Sunday, the team signed her to a rest-of-season deal promptly. Indiana was able to do so without releasing a player thanks to the hardship exception—since multiple players are presently injured for the Fever (Danielle Robinson, Bernadett Hatar, and Chelsey Perry have all missed multiple games), they were able to bring in Cannon without a corresponding move. “We’re all excited for her,” head coach Marianne Stanley said of Cannon getting a deal for the rest of the season. “Emma has added a lot to our team. Love her energy, love her effort.” Cannon has finally found a home in Indiana after bouncing around the WNBA in recent seasons. She spent the 2017 campaign with the Phoenix Mercury, her first season in the league after going undrafted in 2011, and then joined the Las Vegas Aces in the WNBA bubble for a few games in 2020. In the ongoing season, she spent time with both the Aces and the Connecticut Sun for short stints before landing in Indiana, where she has achieved the biggest role in her career thus far. Between the number of injuries the Fever have dealt with recently and her seamless fit within the team’s culture, Cannon quickly became a useful piece for the team in the Circle City. Multiple players who often get minutes at the power forward and center positions, including Jantel Lavender, Jessica Breland, Hatar, and Perry, have missed time since the Olympic break, so Stanley has called Cannon’s number often. The newest Fever player has responded well to her expanded role. She played nearly 20 minutes in her debut with the team and provided solid play during a close loss in Los Angeles. Just two games later, Cannon played for 30 minutes in Dallas, a game in which the Fever only had seven available players. Indiana won the game, and Cannon was a huge reason why — she contributed 16 points on 7/9 shooting as well as five rebounds in the win. Her impact was immediately felt by her new team. “I thought Emma did a really nice job at the defensive end in particular. She’s an undersized post player, but she plays bigger than she is,” Stanley said after Cannon’s debut. She had five points and four rebounds against the Sparks, and the Fever outscored Los Angeles by three points with Cannon on the court. “She made some critical defensive plays that really helped us. I was pretty pleased for her first time.” Cannon provides much of her value on the defensive end of the court. She’s tenacious and smart on the less glamorous end of the floor, and she fights hard on the glass. It’s rare to see the Florida Southern College product get bullied out of position or bumped away from a rebound. The numbers display this well. Over the course of the season, the Fever have a 108.7 defensive rating when Cannon is not in the game. With Cannon on the court, though, that number falls to 100.0. The veteran forward has made the Fever 8.7 points per 100 possessions better defensively, which has substantially improved the team’s fortunes in recent games. Phoenix Mercury center Kia Vaughn (1) drives against Indiana Fever forward Emma Cannon, left, in the ... [+] second half of a WNBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Monday, Sept. 6, 2021. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) “Emma is somebody who can be relied upon to play hard every time, to play hard at both ends. And to just do what she does well and not try to invent things she’s not capable of doing,” Stanley noted. “She’s a good rebounder, she’s a good defender, she works hard, and she plays hard. And she’s team oriented, all of those things are things that we value.” Off the court, part of what made Cannon so successful is that she fit in with her Fever teammates quickly. Many of members of the roster have raved about her and how she blends within the already-established team culture; anyone who plays hard every second they are on the court will become well-liked quickly. Something else that helped Cannon was familiarity. In 2017 in Phoenix as well as 2020 in Las Vegas, Cannon was teammates with current Fever point guard Danielle Robinson. Additionally, Cannon and reserve guard Lindsay Allen were teammates with the Aces last season. Those two helped the 32-year old fit with her new squad.   “I feel super comfortable,” Cannon said of being with the Fever after a win in Dallas. “They welcomed me with open arms.” Allen has enjoyed being reunited with her former teammate. The two have done well in their time on the floor together — Allen has assisted Cannon on made baskets as much or more than any other teammate this season, and the Fever have shot 51.7% with the duo on the court.  “With Emma, she’s such a vet. She just kind of fills in wherever you need her to,” Allen detailed earlier this week. “She fits in well. She just plays hard and with a lot of heart, and that’s kind of all you want in a teammate.” Cannon’s contract only spans the rest of the ongoing season. But Stanley values the team’s culture and continuing to build upon the already-in-place values. Because Cannon clicks with her teammates and has fans within the franchise, it’s plausible that the Fever would want to bring her back next season, or at least bring her into training camp to fight for a roster spot. But it’s too early to think about that. The Fever are still focusing on this season and making a late surge, and Cannon can help with that. She gels extremely well with the team on and off the court, so she should have no problems helping Indiana claim some victories in their last five games. Cannon’s defense and demeanor have helped the Indiana Fever in her three weeks with the team thus far, and now that she’s signed for the rest of the season, those skills will continue to help the team down the stretch.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyeast/2021/09/08/defense-rebounding-and-playing-with-heart-why-the-indiana-fever-signed-emma-cannon-to-rest-of-season-deal/,"Defense, Rebounding And Heart: Why The Indiana Fever Signed Emma Cannon To Rest-Of-Season Deal"
"'Matrix Resurrection' poster This first poster for Lana Wachowski's The Matrix: Resurrections is a fine example of minimalist artwork. It banks on franchise iconography over star power. The Keanu Reeves/Carrie Anne-Moss/Yahya Abdul-Mateen II-starring film is listed as opening on 12-22-21 (a palindrome!). The text (""The Choice Is Yours"") and image placement have some pretty overt implications.  I'm guessing it's not a coincidence that the red pill (which showed Neo the truth about the real world) is implicitly positioned as ""see it in theaters."" In contrast, the blue pill (which allowed Thomas Anderson to forget and ignore that his world was a computer simulation) is positioned as ""also on HBO Max."" The choice is clear: multiplexes are ""the real world,"" while streaming is ""a comforting false illusion."" This isn't about the moral and philosophical debates about the current ""streaming versus theaters amid a pandemic"" conversation. I'm hoping that even the Delta variant will have subsided by Christmas. However, it would undoubtedly behoove Warner Bros., Village Roadshow and friends if more folks showed up to see The Matrix: Resurrections in theaters instead of watching it at home on HBO Max.  This is an expensive, big-scale, IMAX-friendly action fantasy. It was green-lit and produced as an ""only in theaters"" release with the then-standard global theatrical roll-out and 90-day window. Moreover, we've thus far seen mixed (at best) evidence that folks who otherwise would have gone to a cinema are opting for HBO Max *instead of* theaters.  Godzilla Vs. Kong earned best-case-scenario box office ($100 million domestic and $460 million worldwide on a $165 million budget). It also notched a strong-for-HBO Max 5.1 million households over the first 17 days. Yet In the Heights, Reminiscence, Those Who Wish Me Dead and The Little Things didn't break SVOD streaming viewership records even as they died badly in theaters.  Quality notwithstanding, most of the films that bombed in theaters (The Suicide Squad and Space Jam: A New Legacy both cost way too much even for pre-Covid times) didn't exactly earn sky-high initial HBO Max viewings either. Mortal Kombat (still the HBO Max champ with 5.5 million households in 17 days) may be the exception. Still, a solid $23 million debut but a frontloaded $42 million finish and a weak $83 million worldwide cume on a $55 million budget do not a sequel make in normal circumstances.  The Conjuring 3 (while still a hit with $197 million on a $39 million budget) took a slight domestic hit ($64 million domestic) even while ""only"" nabbing under two million households on opening weekend. And Judas and the Last Messiah still became the A-level Oscar contender it was initially positioned as, with Daniel Kaluuya winning Best Supporting Actor for the Best Picture-nominated WB release.  That's not to say the ""in theaters and on HBO Max"" plan is all doom-n-gloom. AT&T swore at the time that it was just a 2021 strategy as the pandemic continued to rage. HBO Max provided a cushion of for less-predictable theatrical results. WB's steady supply of high-end theatrical product was a factor in theaters' ability to weather the storm, while HBO Max’s success or failure wasn’t entirely resting on the hybrid release of theatrical movies. I'd argue the overperformances on opening weekend (relatively speaking) of Tom & Jerry, Godzilla Vs. Kong and Mortal Kombat gave other studios the confidence actually to schedule a summer movie season. Moreover, quality notwithstanding, most of WB's 2021 slate were theatrical coin tosses or likely bombs. Wonder Woman 1984 (released last Christmas) was the only surefire smash sacrificed to the streaming gods.  Even pre-Covid, folks don't show up for movies like Those Who Want Me Dead or Reminiscence anymore. They love to talk about wanting more original, diverse, star-driven, non-franchise and/or adult-skewing theatrical offerings. They are then nowhere to be found when the likes of The Goldfinch, The Good Liar, The Way Back, The Little Things, The Kitchen, Richard Jewell, Blinded By the Light and/or In the Heights open theatrically.  We'll see if The Many Saints of Newark or Clint Eastwood's Cry Macho buck the trend. I'll be optimistic for Will Smith's King Richard in November. However, of WB's ""questionable"" biggies (Dune, Godzilla Vs. Kong, The Suicide Squad, Space Jam: A New Legacy), I'd argue Matrix 4 had the best chance of really breaking out pre-Covid.  The Matrix is a beloved IP. Keanu Reeves is as popular as he's ever been. There's at least one generation that grew up liking The Matrix Reloaded (which earned solid reviews and grossed $742 million worldwide in summer 2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (which earned mixed-negative reviews and grossed ""just"" $427 million in late 2003) more than the conventional wisdom suggests. The wonky, audience-challenging components of the franchise may well play better as a franchise that looks and feels different from your stereotypical Marvel/DC spectacular. WB had reason to hope that Matrix 4 would play closer to (relatively speaking) The Force Awakens and Jurassic World than Terminator: Dark Fate and Independence Day: Resurgence. I expect the marketing to hammer home the notion, hopefully in a non-confrontational way, that seeing Matrix: Resurrections in theaters is the ""real"" way to see it.

Mark Milley to resign because of a “disastrous” evacuation operation. The caucus also announced that an impeachment resolution against Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been filed. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Eight lawmakers led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, asked the companies to preserve the phone and communications records of 16 unnamed individuals, who, Biggs said in a statement, are “Democrat representatives.” Biggs said the records will be used for “future investigative use” – with the letter citing unspecified “alleged infractions” – adding that he wants to force Democrats to live “under the same rules and standards they impose.”  The 14 firms that got the letters, including Twitter, Verizon and Apple, were among the 35 companies asked by the select committee to preserve similar records of Capitol riot defendants and Trump allies who participated in efforts to overturn the election. The letter from the Republicans argued that both the select committee and the companies lack the “legal authority to provide those records,” adding that, if they did comply, it would “end with Congress rifling through the private records of any American.” The lawmakers who signed the letter – Biggs and Reps. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) – are all targets of the select committee’s records request, according to CNN and NBC News. House Republicans have repeatedly threatened companies not to comply with the select committee’s request, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy warning that Republicans “will not forget” any compliance if they retake Congress in 2022. The eight Republicans, plus Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), sent a letter to the companies vowing to “pursue all legal remedies” if they comply.

"Climate positive (carbon negative) goals in Napa and Sonoma vineyards California wineries have long been leaders in environmentally friendly practices, because they recognized early on that wine grapes are one of the most susceptible crops to global warming. Indeed by 2019, 99% of Sonoma County vineyards were certified sustainable and 94% of Napa vineyards and wineries achieved certification under the Napa Green program. However, now both counties have established even more aggressive goals to reduce their carbon footprint and become climate positive – which is beyond carbon neutral, with negative emission reductions. The sustainability certifications the vineyards achieved focused on efforts to improve the environment, employee working conditions, and economics - also referred to as planet, people and profits. Certifications were provided by third-party organization such as California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, Napa Green, and Fish Friendly Farming. However with so much progress, sustainability has become a new baseline for moving forward. “Any continued actions we can take to reduce energy use in the vineyard and wineries will help to reduce our carbon footprint,” reports Anna Brittain, Executive Director for Napa Green. With this in mind, Napa Green has set a goal to work with certified growers to become carbon neutral within six years (2027), and carbon negative, or climate positive, within nine years (2030).  Sonoma County has also adopted a similar program called the Climate Adaption Certification Program. “We launched this program in 2020,” states Karissa Kruse, President of Sonoma County Winegrowers, and are working with local vineyards to administer best practices to maximize the sequestration of carbon emissions.” Some of these practices include reduced tilling of the soil, as well as planting more native shrubs around vineyards. These efforts couldn’t come sooner, because the recent UN Climate Report has confirmed that global warming of 1.5°C to 2°C will occur as soon as 2040 if the world doesn’t take actions to reduce carbon (CO2) emissions soon. The results of global warming have already been witnessed in the increase in severe weather patterns such as wildfires, floods, and extreme frost/heat events that negatively impact agriculture. According to the EPA, the most effective way to reduce CO2 is to reduce fossil fuel consumption. It is also possible to sequester CO2 in the earth by planting more trees, plants, and cover crops. Several studies have been conducted on the carbon footprint of the global wine industry, and it turns out that farming of vineyards produces very little CO2 and other greenhouse gases. One study assumed that fertilizers used in the vineyard would be a big contributor, but compared to other agriculture, vineyards use very little fertilizer. Indeed, according to Kruse, “In California, all of agriculture, including livestock operations, produces only 8% of the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.” Instead it is the transportation of wine that is the biggest culprit, as well as gas-operated tractors in the vineyard and energy use in the winery. According to a 2021 Italian wine study, the main contributors of greenhouse gas emissions for wine are: the glass bottle (29%), electricity in the winery (14%), transport and distribution of wine to the consumer (13%), heat used in the winery (9%) and fossil fuels used in vineyard (8%). Because of this, efforts in the vineyard are focusing on reducing the number of passes a tractor must make through the vines, as well as adopting regenerative farming practices that include less tilling of the soil. This will not only reduce fossil fuels used in the vineyard, but the cover crop will allow vineyards to sequester carbon. In this way, vineyards represent “low hanging fruit” to become carbon negative, or climate positive. Efforts to reduce energy usage in the winery are also underway, but will take more time. “Doing a full-scale carbon footprint inventory for a winery is very complicated,” states Brittan, “but we have some wineries who are also working on this. They are focusing on reducing bottle weight and other packaging modification, as well as installing solar, tracking waste, and implementing other energy and water saving mechanisms.” Individual wineries in Napa and Sonoma are also taking other actions towards becoming climate positive. Joe Nielsen, Director of Winemaking at Ram’s Gate Winery in Sonoma County has decided to convert their vineyards from certified sustainable to organic. “We decided to bring in sheep to eat the weeds in the vineyard to reduce the number of times the tractor has to pass through the vines to spray herbicides ,” he said. “We are also investigating the use of electronic tractors, rather than gas powered ones.” At Quintessa Winery in Napa Valley, they have just become certified in both Organic and Biodynamic vineyard operations. “We have been certified sustainable for many years,” reports Rebekah Wineburg, Quintessa Winemaker. “But this year we completed the formal 3-year certification process with CCOF and Demeter. We also have a philosophy to maintain as many of the native oaks and shrubs as possible to sequester carbon.”  Other wineries are making positive efforts to reduce water usage and the energy associated with pumping it into the vineyards and winery operations. Hope Goldie, Winemaker at Darioush in Napa Valley states, “We are reducing leaf removal in the vineyards and using micro emitters below the canopy to spray as minimal amount of water as possible, but still help the vines stay healthy and survive the drought.” At Chandon California, they are also reducing water by converting all of their landscaping to drought tolerant plants. “For the next two years we are embarking on a significant renovation to our grounds and the winery to reduce our water and energy usage,” states Pauline Lhote, Winemaking Director at Chandon. ""Chandon has also been working to reduce the weight of our bottles, which is one of the biggest contributors to wine’s carbon footprint. So far we have managed to reduce it by 25%, which means less weight in transportation to customers and therefore less use of fossil fuels.” Two of the largest wineries in Napa and Sonoma have set aggressive goals to become climate positive. Jackson Family Wines, owners of Kendall-Jackson, Cardinale, La Crema and many other brands has just set a goal to cut their carbon footprint in half by 2030 and become climate positive by 2050. Treasury Wine Estates, owner of Beringer, Chateau St. Jean and many other brands has set a corporate goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. Other Napa/Sonoma vineyards and wineries that have made progress towards climate positive goals include Benziger, Dutton Ranch, Spottswoode, Larkmead, Cakebread, Raymond, Chimney Rock, and Protector Cellars, amongst others.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizthach/2021/09/08/how-napa-and-sonoma-vineyards-are-going-beyond-sustainability-to-embrace-climate-positive-goals/,How Napa And Sonoma Vineyards Are Going Beyond Sustainability To Embrace Climate-Positive Goals
" Leon Black, the billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management, on Wednesday denied allegations from an ex-girlfriend who claims the private-equity tycoon once flew her against her will to Florida to “satisfy the sex needs” of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.  Leon Black, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management. In a document filed Wednesday in New York state court, lawyers representing Black denied the claims made by former Russian model Guzel Ganieva in a defamation and sexual violence lawsuit she leveled against Black earlier this year.  Black’s legal team stated that Ganieva’s claim that Black flew her to Florida in October 2008 to have sex with Epstein was “demonstrably false … from start to finish.”  The lawyers said they have records showing Black and Ganieva did not fly to Palm Beach as Ganieva alleged, as well as a recording of a conversation in which Ganieva denies ever meeting Epstein.  Ganieva, meanwhile, claimed in a filing early last month that Black hijacked lunch plans in Manhattan to fly her to meet Epstein, who she says Black described as his “best friend.”  Black threatened to plant drugs on the ex-model if she told anyone about the trip and then appeared to want her to have sex with both him and Epstein at the now-deceased financier’s Palm Beach home, Ganieva claimed.  “The problem for Ms. Ganieva is that the entire Epstein storyline is made up ... and there is overwhelming documentary proof that she has lied once again and that she has been caught red-handed once again,” Black’s attorney Danya Perry said in a statement sent to Forbes. “Mr. Black intends to hold responsible all those involved in this fraudulent scheme for the damage they have caused Mr. Black and his family.” “Black’s billions and his powerful connections will not prevent the truth from coming out,” Ganieva’s attorney Jeanne Christensen said in a statement. “We are confident that a jury of Ms. Ganieva’s peers will hold Black accountable for Black’s horrific conduct as alleged in our complaint by Ms. Ganieva.” Ganieva filed a lawsuit in June accusing Black, 69, of coercing her into signing a nondisclosure agreement to stay silent about years of “sexual violence,” including rape, and using his money and power to exert control over her after the two met while Ganieva, now 38 years old, was in her eary 20s. But Black—in a 52-page counterclaim filed July 19—deemed Ganieva’s claims a “work of fiction,” saying though he had an affair with the model from 2008 to 2015 while he was still married, it was a consensual relationship that she spun into an “extortion scheme.” Black’s lawyers said in the court filing he gave Ganieva millions of dollars in gifts during their relationship, including a pricey Upper East Side apartment, a Steinway piano and her tuition paid at Columbia University, all of which made him an “easy target” for extortion.  Days after Ganieva went public with her claims in March, Black unexpectedly resigned as chairman of Apollo and handed over the CEO reins months earlier than previously planned, in a management shift precipitated by scrutiny over his connection to Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on human trafficking charges. Black also announced he would not run for reelection as the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art. An investigation by Apollo’s board of directors revealed earlier this year that Black paid Epstein $158 million in fees and services, loaned him over $30 million and made a $10 million donation to Epstein’s charity before the two cut off their relationship in 2018 over a “fee dispute.” While the probe by law firm Dechert found “no evidence Mr. Black was involved in any way with Mr. Epstein’s criminal activities at the time,” the vast sums of money forwarded to Epstein for what Black described as “professional services to my family partnership and related family entities” drew scrutiny over how Black may have supported Epstein’s accused criminal behavior. Black has claimed he had no knowledge of the sexual trafficking of minors Epstein was allegedly engaged in.  “Leon Black Claims 'Extortion’ By Russian Model: The Latest Scandal Plaguing The Epstein-Linked Billionaire, Explained” (Forbes)  “Apollo Billionaire Leon Black Tried To Make Russian Model Have Sex With Jeffrey Epstein, Court Filing Claims” (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/billionaire-leon-black-denies-trafficking-ex-girlfriend-to-jeffrey-epstein/,Billionaire Leon Black Denies Trafficking Ex-Girlfriend To Jeffrey Epstein
"Cosmic Camp space shuttle Parents are on notice that toys will be in short supply this year due to snags in the supply chain. “There is going to be a major shortage of toy products this year,” MGA Entertainment CEO Isaac Larian told CNN Business. “The demand is going to be there. What is not going to be there is the product to fill the demand.”  It’s got toy retailers on edge, afraid they’ll leave many parents and kids disappointed this year. However, Camp, described as a “family experience store,” believes this could be its best holiday season ever.  That’s because Camp’s business model doesn’t rely just on selling more toys. It puts creating kid-friendly experiences first – called “programming” in Camp parlance. Purchasing one or many toys is the collectible, take-home memento of the fun times spent there.  “Camp is more than a retail store,” explains Tiffany Markofsky, Camp’s co-founder and chief communications officer. “We combine play product and programming for a totally unique family experience.” The genesis of the Camp concept was co-founder and CEO Ben Kaufman’s childhood memories of shopping for a much coveted toy. What lived on long after he outgrew the toy was the excitement of going shopping for it.  “The toy matters for the moment, but as time goes on, what’s remembered is going to the toy store. We designed Camp to put back that excitement by creating memorable moments for kids and their parents,” Markofsky says. “The Camp experience is the thing. It is the gift.” Each of the six Camp stores is divided into two areas. Families enter the street-side Canteen that serves as a general store for toys, gifts and refreshments. Then behind the Canteen is a pivoting wall, called the “Magic Door,” where the experiences happen, staged and performed by staffers called “Counselors.”  “It’s kind of like a speakeasy for kids and behind the door our counselors engage with kids and their families by performing music, a magic show or dance and organize crafts and projects,” Markofsky explains. Some of the narrative retail themes are Travel Camp, Cooking Camp, Toy Lab Camp and Base Camp.  “We combine play and product throughout the experience. It’s more about discover than simply displaying products on shelves,” she continues.  Each store offers a different behind-the-door programming experience with themes moving onto another store after its local run. Typically programming changes up quarterly throughout the year.  While the chain’s expansion concept is not described as a hub-and-spoke model, it looks like one, since five of its stores are in the New York City area. That gives parents there an opportunity to enjoy totally different experiences in multiple visits each season. The company’s statistics of repeat visits prove it works.  “Since our inception, we’ve always believed that we were going to be a national retailer. Our model is predicated on the idea that we would have multiple locations,” Markofsky explains. Right now it has one store in Dallas and is soon to open one in Los Angeles, suggesting its next hubs. Another distinctive in its model is brands can sponsor activities and activations in its locations. A diversity of brands have been drawn to this unique opportunity to connect with families, including Mastercard, Walmart, Kroger, Scotts Miracle-Gro and Ally Bank. For a retailer that puts so much store on in-person experiences, the Covid shutdowns put it back on its heels. The company had to go virtual fast and thanks to Kaufman’s previous experience as chief marketing officer at BuzzFeed, the company was ready.  “As a company, we do things quickly. We are constantly experimenting and working to meet the needs of families which changed so quickly during the pandemic,” Markofsky says. “We were there, offering parents one-hour a day of free programming for their kids. It was really interactive and our sponsors stayed with us as we shifted experiences online. Kids were glued to their screens.” Camp also innovated its online shopping experience to make it kid-friendly and kid-safe. Parents purchase virtual tokens that the child can redeem with an easy-to-remember code when they go shopping online. Called Present Shop, kids share their age and interests and the shop serves appropriate options to buy. Once stores began to open up, that presented another challenge: how to keep families safe in enclosed spaces that before the pandemic attracted crowds. They began to experiment with ticketed time-slots where parents could either register in advance for free admittance or paid for tickets to go behind the Magic Door with the price redeemable for take-home gifts.  This paid ticket model was tested first for the recently opened Paw Patrol experience in its Dallas store, sponsored by Spin Master. Markofsky reports attendance reached 15,000 in the first month it has been opened. Taking even a bigger leap into ticketed entrance is the latest exhibition at its NYC Fifth Avenue store called Cosmic Camp. Guests are invited to “go into space.”  Entering the Cosmic Camp experience It offers families an intergalactic adventure of games and exploration where each family member gets a connected “communicator” for their wrists to keep track of their scores in the games. Some of the activities include tossing meteorites into black holes, control space rovers, jumping through a field of lava and commanding a space station.  Unlike other installations, Cosmic Camp is a pure-play experience and no toys are displayed behind the door, though plenty of space-themed toys are available out front in the canteen.     “Cosmic Camp is more like an escape room where family can earn points together,” Markofsky explains. “We wanted to give families that are trying to get back to normal something fun to do that wasn’t based on retail. And we made it to be fun for all ages, from youngsters, tweens, teens and adults,” she continues, noting that other installations like Paw Patrol skew toward a younger crowd. Just opened this past weekend, Cosmic Camp has drawn the crowds. “It’s been early days so far, but what's great is that we are seeing that the two ticketed experiences are not limiting traffic numbers,” she reports. In closing, Markofsky reports that company revenues increased three-fold in the past year despite the pandemic closures and she is confident that growth will continue at its heady pace, especially as it plans to add two more stores in the Northeast in the coming months, with more potential stores on the drawing board. “We’re creating an environment for families to come, share and enjoy. Its very much about creating memorable moments for families,” she says. As for what Camp is planning for this holiday shopping season, Markofsky says it is still too early to say. But what ever it is, it will be big and an experience that families will want to celebrate together. Buying toys will simply be the icing on the cake, of which they have plenty already in stock.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/09/08/family-friendly-camp-has-the-answer-to-this-years-toy-supply-shortage-give-an-experience/,Family-Friendly Camp Has The Answer To This Year’s Toy Supply Shortage: Give An Experience
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday pledged to keep the U.S. Capitol “intact” as lawmakers and law enforcement prepare for a rally later this month to demand the release of Capitol riot defendants, which has raised concerns about a repeat of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 08: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks during her weekly ... [+] news conference at the U.S. Capitol on September 8, 2021 in Washington, DC. Pelosi spoke on a range of issues, including the debt ceiling and climate change. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Asked during a press conference about preparations being taken ahead of the rally, planned for September 18 on the West Lawn of the Capitol complex, Pelosi declined to offer specifics but said, “We intend to have the integrity of the Capitol be intact.” Pelosi also confirmed law enforcement will brief Congress on the rally – first the House Administration Committee and then members of congressional leadership – adding that she’ll make future announcements about the event. A Capitol Police spokesperson told Forbes they are “working with our local, state, and federal partners” to prepare for the rally, after chief Tom Manger said in a statement the department is “closely monitoring” September 18. The D.C. Metropolitan Police will have an “increased presence around the city where demonstrations will be taking place,” spokesperson Brianna Burch told Forbes, adding that they are prepared to close streets. The rally has Congress on edge coming eight months after January 6, but some have professed defiance: House staffer Mark Greenbaum told Forbes he has “strong confidence” in the Capitol Police to keep the Capitol safe, stating of the rally-goers, “These losers will not deter me one iota from working here.” The rally’s organizer, former Trump campaign aide Matt Braynard, has claimed a “perfect safety record” across a dozen rallies held to support those charged in the Capitol riot, and urged attendees at the Capitol rally to be “respectful and kind” to law enforcement. Braynard told Forbes his group has been working with the law enforcement and are “fully cooperative with their rules,” adding that they have a “private, diplomatic security team” coordinating with the Capitol Police and volunteers to keep the event “safe and productive.” Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-Fla.), who have both been vocal advocates of Capitol riot defendants, are not attending the rally, their spokespeople told Forbes. Hundreds of Trump supporters, emboldened by former President Donald Trump’s baseless election fraud claims, stormed the Capitol on January 6 in an effort to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s 2020 Electoral College victory. The violence led to Trump’s second impeachment and spawned a wide-reaching House select committee investigation. Despite Braynard’s calls for non-violence, law enforcement reportedly still fears the event could escalate into a repeat of the Capitol attack. An intelligence evaluation from the Capitol Police said it is “not unreasonable to plan for violent altercations” given the views of the rally-goers, according to Roll Call. “Now these people are coming back to praise the people who are out to kill. Out to kill members of Congress, successfully causing the deaths… of our law enforcement,” Pelosi said of the rally, telling reporters, “Understand how strongly we think about this.” 1,000. That’s the approximate number of assaults on federal officers that were captured on body camera footage of the January 6 attack, federal prosecutors said in a court filing last week. Nearly 600 individuals have been charged for the riot. Defending those being prosecuted for theCapitol riot has become a popular cause for  some Republicans in Congress, with Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and other members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus rallying outside the Department of Justice in July to protest their treatment. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) landed in hot water earlier this month for calling them “political hostages” and vowing to “bust them out.” There have been discussions about reinstalling the security fence around that Capitol complex that was erected in the wake of January 6 and taken down in July, according to WUSA9 and the Associated Press, which reported that members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are planning to attend. Asked Wednesday whether the fence will be put back up, Pelosi said, “Not necessarily.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/08/pelosi-vows-to-protect-capitol-as-congress-braces-for-justice-for-j6-rally/,Pelosi Vows To Protect Capitol As Congress Braces For ‘Justice For J6’ Rally
"Florida schools will be able to order staff and students to wear face masks while litigation against the state’s ban on school mask mandates plays out, a judge ruled Wednesday, halting the state’s efforts to punish schools that have enacted mask orders after the ban went back into effect when the state appealed a ruling striking it down. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida.  Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper ruled in favor of the Florida parents who brought the lawsuit against the state, who asked the court to strike down a stay that kept the school mask mandate ban in effect. Cooper had previously issued a permanent injunction against Florida’s school mask mandate ban, which prohibits districts from imposing mandates unless they let parents opt their children out of them, saying state officials had overstepped their authority by issuing the ban and that it did not comply with state law. The state then appealed that ruling, however, which triggered an automatic stay that temporarily blocked the ruling as the litigation played out—and let the state move forward with plans to withhold funding from Florida districts that have imposed mask mandates. The parents that brought the lawsuit said that stay should be struck down because of the “irreparable harm” if the ban stays in effect, given its potential impact on Covid-19 transmission in schools, but the state claimed that argument was “unhelpful and irresponsible” and that the ban should remain in effect. Cooper said during a hearing Wednesday he was setting the stay aside because he did not believe there would be any harm to the state if the ban was prohibited, while unvaccinated children face a higher threat of infection from the delta variant and masking is one of the only ways they can protect themselves against it. The judge said he believed the case would succeed on appeal because the Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights—the law that the state said justified their ban—stipulates that school districts can impose policies that infringe on parents’ rights if they are “reasonable” and “narrowly tailored,” as the school mask mandates are. “This case has generated a lot of heat and a lot of light, but the bottom line is this case is about enforcing the laws the legislature passed, and...that and the pandemic situation that we are in are why I think setting aside this stay is appropriate,” Cooper said Wednesday, noting his order striking down the stay would go into effect “immediately.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said in a statement responding to the ruling that it was “no surprise” to them that Cooper “concluded that he is unlikely to be overruled on appeal” and that the state “(unsurprisingly) disagree[s].” The state intends to immediately file an emergency motion to have the stay reinstated. At least 12. That’s how many school districts in Florida have enacted strict mask mandates, including those covering the state’s biggest cities like Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa and Tallahassee. The state has already withheld funding against the first two counties to impose mask mandates equivalent to the amount of their school board members’ salaries, which they’ve said they’ll keep withholding on a monthly basis. They have also warned similar consequences will be coming for the other school districts that followed their lead, though districts have said they will keep their mandates in place despite the punishments they may face. The Florida Department of Education has moved forward with those consequences even in the wake of Cooper’s initial ruling, and FDOE director of communications Jared Ochs told Forbes last week the state would continue to withhold funding “until a court tells us we cannot.”  Florida is one of 10 states that have enacted some sort of ban on school mask mandates, though not all are presently in effect. Mask mandate bans have also been at least temporarily struck down in Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma and Texas’ ban was put on hold as litigation plays out, though the South Carolina Supreme Court has upheld that state’s prohibition and struck down a school district’s mask mandate as a result. Florida’s ban has drawn particular scrutiny given the state’s massive Covid-19 surge, which has resulted in thousands of positive cases among schoolchildren, the deaths of a number of Florida teachers and caused some schools to temporarily shut down for in-person learning entirely. The state has continued to defend its ban on school mask mandates despite its outbreak and the controversy it's caused, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he believed the state was “going to have really good grounds to appeal” Cooper’s initial ruling and that the ban will ultimately be upheld.

"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo by Jasin Boland. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.  Walt Disney and Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) earned a strong $6.85 million on Tuesday, which is a reasonable 64% drop from its sky-high $19.4 million Labor Day gross. The Tuesday figure is enough to push the Simu Liu/Awkwafina/Tony Leung/Michelle Leung actioner past the $100 million mark in just five days of domestic theatrical release, with a $101.523 million Fri-Tues cume. Black Widow actually had a slightly higher ($7.7 million) Tuesday gross, but the Scarlett Johansson flick needed an extra day to pass said milestone. Shang-Chi notched the fastest race to $100 million since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker nabbed a $177 million domestic debut in late-December 2019. Presuming the domestic/overseas split hasn’t changed to any extreme degree, Shang-Chi has earned around $170 million worldwide thus far. That already surpassing all but the biggest 2021 releases (Godzilla Vs. Kong, A Quiet Place part II, F9, Black Widow and Free Guy). It should be past Jungle Cruise ($194 million as of Sunday) and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It ($197 million) in the next day or three, with Free Guy ($239 million as of Sunday, plus whatever it’s earned in China since then) next on the list. And since Shang-Chi is only in theaters for the next several weeks, there won’t be an “Premier Access” variable mucking up post-debut legs or repeat viewings. Jungle Cruise may have cost too much, but the Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt flick will still end up right between Rampage ($103 million in 2018) and Central Intelligence ($126 million in 2016), with a multiplier already 3x its $35 million opening. Likewise, as everyone wrongly panicked over the lousy $26.5 million debut of The Suicide Squad (as if a summer filled with the likes of Suicide Squad 2, Snake Eyes and Peter Rabbit 2 was going to get everything back to pre-Covid normalcy), 20th Century’s Free Guy opened with $28 million (from a $10.4 million Friday) and legged out to $94 million-and-counting. The original, star-driven, high-concept comic fantasy isn’t just an old-school “new franchise” in the making.  The Ryan Reynolds/Jodie Comer flick is doing quite well in China, with $58 million in ten days from a $23.5 million debut. That, yes, offers hope that there’s still a place for Hollywood movies (outside of safe franchises like the MonsterVerse and The Fast Saga) to prosper in China. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is crushing any and all previous Labor Day-specific expectations, not only providing further evidence for the value of theatrical exclusivity but reminding folks that a blockbuster can open anywhere. Disney is again leading the overall domestic box office with over $619 million (counting the 20th Century output) for 2021.  For what it’s worth, Disney really did show up and do their part to “help” movie theaters right at the end of the summer. Granted, none of this is rooted in altruism and not every entertainment story is about “good” and “evil,” but Disney’s most recent four-quadrant offerings (Jungle Cruise, Free Guy and now Shang-Chi) are going to essentially run the tables between now and Venom: Let There Be Carnage on October 1 and No Time to Die on October 8. They may have let Universal (in late 2020) and Warner Bros. (in the first half of 2021) weather the storm, but they showed up, like Gandalf at the end of The Two Towers, right when everyone was starting to panic.  Of course, nobody wants a theatrical environment where it’s Disney, Disney and only Disney, so I’m still expecting you folks to show up for Sony’s Venom sequel, MGM’s James Bond flick, Universal’s Halloween sequel and (fingers-crossed) Warner Bros.’ Dune. over the next month-and-change. Of course, if you could show up to some non-franchise films (WB’s Cry Macho, Focus’ The Card Counter, Universal’s Dear Evan Hansen, etc.), that would be super, but one step at a time right? As I noted on a podcast appearance last night, in the last 1.5 years we’ve gone from “Gee, I wish folks saw more than just Disney flicks and franchise pics in theaters.” to “Thank goodness everyone showed up for the new Marvel movie!” Still, whatever misgivings I had about Disney mostly sitting on the sidelines (and messing up the Black Widow release by making the Disney+ factor the center of the narrative), they did eventually show up to at least try and save the day.

"Solar power could supply nearly half of American electricity by 2035, according to an Energy Department report released Wednesday—a goal that would require the U.S. to add unprecedented capacity to the power grid each year but one that would cost far less than doing nothing as the catastrophic effects of climate change become more apparent amid a summer of record heat waves, wildfires and storms. MGM Resorts launched a 100-megawatt array of solar panels on June 28, 2021 in Dry Lake Valley, ... [+] Nevada. Solar power generates just 3% of U.S. electricity today, according to the Solar Futures Study.  The study estimates that solar could provide 40% of all electricity by 2035. By 2050, solar and wind energy could satisfy 90% of U.S. needs. For solar to provide 40% of power, the U.S. would need to add twice as much solar capacity as last year—which was a record—until 2025, and then four times as much between 2025 and 2030. Switching to solar power will not raise electric bills before 2035, the report contends, because the costs of switching could be offset by savings resulting from new technologies that make it cheaper to produce and store energy—but those technologies have not been realized.   Increasing solar power would increase long-term power generation costs by about 25%, or an additional $562 billion through 2050, according to the study. But not adopting solar would end up costing more, according to the study. Spending to fix damage from climate change—and forgoing the public health savings from solar power improving air quality—could cost between $1.1 trillion and $1.7 trillion, they wrote. As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden said that the U.S. should generate 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2035 and that by 2050 it should have net-zero carbon emissions, which means the country would release an amount that can be naturally absorbed by the earth and stored by different technologies. Democrats’ top two legislative priorities go some way toward meeting the Energy Department’s goals while protecting against worsening climate change. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) asked his members to have the Senate version of a $3.5 trillion budget resolution passed by the House—which includes incentives and requirements for power companies to produce all their power with renewable sources like solar by 2035—ready by September 15. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised that her chamber would vote by September 27 on a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate. That bill, passed in August, would provide funding to upgrade power grids, sewer systems and other infrastructure to protect against severe weather events that have been made more frequent and more extreme by climate change, such as early September’s record rainfalls in the New York City area, which unleashed flash floods drowning dozens of people who were trapped in cars and basements.

Sila Nanotechnology, a Silicon Valley-based battery materials company backed by Daimler, said the first commercial application of its silicon-based anodes is for a new fitness tracker and that its longer-term goal is to help get lower-cost, longer-range electric cars on the road.  The Alameda, California-based company said today that its materials are being used in the WHOOP 4.0 health and fitness tracker, allowing for a smaller battery and more compact device. Sila Nano is scaling up production of its anode materials, which replace traditional graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries, and aims to be supplying them for electric vehicle battery packs by 2025, says cofounder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky. A former Tesla battery engineer, he says commercialization of the new anode technology is the biggest breakthrough for lithium-ion cells in three decades.  Cofounder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky “What this really means is that our technology is not just a good scientific breakthrough, but is actually viable, commercially scalable, and that over time can lead to accelerating the electrification of everything,” he tells Forbes. “What's really cool about this technology is that the nature of the material is the exact same between the WHOOP 4.0. And what will eventually go into a Mercedes, a BMW, or any EV. We just need to produce more of it.” Sila claims its silicon-based anode powder allows for a 20% improvement in efficiency over current lithium-ion cells and could eventually boost efficiency by 40%. Gains of that magnitude mean automakers can make electric vehicles more affordable by reducing the size of battery packs to achieve the same range or create EVs with longer range without adding weight.  Materials advances like those touted by Sila Nano may prove critical to helping hold down the cost of electric vehicles and advanced batteries. The power storage devices remain the single most expensive part of an EV and could remain expensive despite pack efficiency improvements because batteries rely on globally sourced commodity metals and materials. Tesla, for example, continues to expand sales of its electric cars and hatchbacks, yet still struggles to sell any of its models for less than $40,000. Berdichevsky, who was part of Tesla’s original battery team when it introduced the Roadster in 2008, cofounded Sila Nano more than a decade ago. The company has raised more than $900 million from investors including Coatue Management, 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Sutter Hill Ventures, along with Daimler. The company is also working with BMW and Japan’s Amperex Technology Limited, or ATL, plans to set up a North American plant that will open in 2024 and eventually produce anode materials for 100 GWh of batteries annually, enough for 1 million electric vehicles.  WHOOP 4.0 health and fitness tracker The WHOOP 4.0 is thinner and lighter than the version it replaces, and its battery can perform for five days using Sila Nano’s technology before needing to be recharged. “One of the greatest barriers to advancing the design of wearable technologies has been the weight and size of the battery technology available,” WHOOP cofounder and CTO John Capodilupo said in a statement. “With Sila, all that has changed. We’ve been able to transform WHOOP 4.0 from its previous version and load it with new features and capabilities, without battery performance compromise.” The project with WHOOP “is the biggest milestone in the company's history,” Berdichevsky says. “We're now 10 years old. And this is the realization of a huge amount of work of actually being in market.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/09/08/sila-nanos-battery-tech-may-bring-cheaper-electric-cars-but-first-a-better-fitness-tracker/,Sila Nano’s Battery Tech May Bring Cheaper Electric Cars—But First A Better Fitness Tracker
"The wealthiest Americans are evading hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes each year, the Treasury Department asserted in a report released Wednesday, using the findings to bolster the case for a proposed $80 billion investment to help the Internal Revenue Service improve tax enforcement. The nation's tax gap is expected to total about $7 trillion over the next decade. According to the Treasury's report, the top 1% of taxpayers, ranked by income, failed to pay about $163 billion in taxes last year, making up about 28% of total unpaid taxes, while the top 5% evaded about $307 billion, or nearly 53% of the overall sum. The total underpayment of about $600 billion would translate to $7 trillion in lost tax revenue over the next decade—a ""striking"" sum equal to about 3% of GDP, or all the taxes paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers, the Treasury notes. The Treasury says the wealthiest Americans account for the bulk of tax evasion because higher-income taxpayers have the financial resources to ""tap into the services of accountants and tax preparers who help shield them from bearing their true income tax liability."" It also attributes part of the tax gap to the lack of reporting requirements on ""opaque"" income sources commonly utilized by high earners, with as much as 55% of noncompliance stemming from partnerships, proprietorship and rental income. ""The United States collects less tax revenue as a percentage of [gross domestic product] than at most points in recent history, in part because owed but uncollected taxes are so significant,"" the Treasury Department's Natasha Sarin wrote in the report. ""These unpaid taxes mean policymakers must choose between rising deficits, lower spending on important priorities, or further tax increase to compensate for lost revenue—which will only be borne by compliant taxpayers.""  Greater tax enforcement. To help pay for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, President Joe Biden's Administration has proposed increasing the IRS' budget by $80 billion over the next 10 years to generate an estimated $320 billion in tax collections over the same period, but lawmakers ultimately scrapped that plan in a bipartisan compromise. It also proposed tax-reporting requirements for financial institutions to help audit ""sophisticated tax evaders."" The administration expects the audits would generate an additional $460 billion over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office last week said the Biden administration’s enforcement plans would only yield about $200 billion in additional revenue. The agency expects some taxpayers will adapt to the stepped up enforcement activities with new ways of evading detection, thereby lowering expected returns after a few years.

"A worker cleans a big melting pot at a steelworks in Salzgitter, Germany. (Photo by Morris ... [+] MacMatzen/Getty Images) One of the things about agreeing to speak on a popular radio station is that you are sure to get a tricky question or two, especially if you are talking about climate change. During a recent interview on Britain's LBC radio station, I spoke about a future where renewables were the dominant form of energy. The challenge came through from a listener that to build the solar and wind infrastructure, surely, we were going to need steel, and we can’t make steel without coal. This was a fair question and it prompted me to find out where we are with the development of zero carbon steel and  what will it take to leave coal out of the equation altogether. Steel is arguably the single most important resource when it comes to constructing our future infrastructure. The origins of steel manufacture dates back to as early as 1800 BC in Anatolia and the principles of making steel from pig iron[1] haven’t changed much over the centuries. Aside from some evolution from using coal to coking coal, today, steel production is still an energy intensive process with the vast majority of that energy coming from fossil fuels. Worldwide, steel is responsible for around 7-9% of all direct emissions from fossil fuels, and most of these come from burning of coal.  Clearly, the challenge for the steel industry is to reduce its carbon emissions. Energy constitutes between 20 and 40% of the cost of steel production, so the reality for most major producers is that ""green steel"" is simply not affordable. Fortunately, 30% of the world’s steel production use electric arc furnaces fed with recycled steel or iron smelted with natural gas and hydrogen. Recycling is obviously a priority to reduce demand for new steel, but steel is already mostly recycled, and we will need new steel. To put into context the relative carbon emissions related to the two forms of steel production, the World Steel Association states that the average blast furnace needs 800kg of coal to produce a tonne of steel while the average electric arc furnace (using mainly recycled steel) needs just 16kg of coal. Steel industry advocates are quick to point out that plenty of the steel it produces is used within the renewable energy sector and more than makes up for the carbon footprint over its lifetime. A three-megawatt wind turbine, for example, can deliver 80 times more energy over 20 years than is used in its production and maintenance materials.  On a more positive and progressive note there are pioneering companies out there bringing new ideas to market. The Swedish company HYBRIT recently began a pilot program for a ""fossil-free"" steel making plant. This ground-breaking program aims to bring fossil-free steel to the market by 2026. It plans to replace coking coal with electricity from renewable energy sources and hydrogen in a process that will produce steel and water as opposed to steel and carbon dioxide. With the rapid advancements in hydrogen energy we could see hydrogen alongside renewable energy become more widespread in creating a new way of developing carbon free steel.  One such accelerator could be the development of hydrogen hubs and how these might work here in the U.K. Such a hub would use excess renewable energy, converted into green hydrogen, and used in a localized industry loop. Green steel could be the perfect solution here in the U.K. where we constrain our wind power by up to 7% a year already and we could easily benefit from hydrogen hubs in the northeast of England, using offshore renewables and bringing back “green” steel to historic manufacturing centers, such as Teesside. All these ideas have their place, but we need to make rapid progress to turn them into mainstream technologies. Higher levels of investment into innovation from government and business will be needed to fast-track the innovations needed for this industry to produce zero carbon steel. We are already building our renewable future and green steel can’t be left behind.   [1] Pig iron is made by smelting iron ore at a temperature exceeding 1600x, and releases the iron from the ore in the form of pig iron, a brittle material containing up to 4.5% carbon. The carbon content is then reduced to produce a useful metal.

"AI driving systems are going to be making life-or-death driving decisions, and we all have a stake ... [+] in how that happens. Think about all of those moment-to-moment rapid decisions that you make while driving a car. Go ahead, do a slow-motion post-driving analysis in your mind. Think about a recent trip to the grocery store or perhaps a driving trek to a local mall. Whether you realize it or not, there were hundreds upon hundreds or likely thousands of minuscule driving decisions that you made, all part of a larger web of driving decisions in the course of a driving journey. And, notably, they all ultimately encompassed some variant of altogether life-or-death considerations.  How so? Let’s see. Imagine that you are driving along amid city streets on an otherwise ordinary day.  If you decide to take that upcoming right turn just a bit overly fast there is a heightened risk that you could inadvertently go awry. You might veer into a pedestrian that is standing out at the curb edge. You might swing wide and brush against another car that is in a nearby lane.  Bam, you smack into someone.  In case you are doubtful that these are decidedly life-or-death-related decisions, I have some somber stats to share with you.  There are about 6.7 million car crashes each year in the United States alone. Those car crashes produce approximately 2.5 million injuries and over 40,000 human fatalities. Few of us are contemplating those ominous stats when we get behind the wheel of a car. Nonetheless, they are quite illuminating numbers and worthy of giving due pause whenever undertaking a driving trip. For more coverage and my in-depth analysis of those driving usage stats, see the link here. Now that you are thinking about all of those itsy-bitsy decisions and how vital they are, let’s zoom to a more macroscopic perspective. You can envision this like using one of those zoom-in to zoom-out visualizations when looking at the planet earth from the vantage of an orbiting space station. I’m sure that you’ve seen those before. A person is standing on a city street and the camera pulls back to reveal them standing amidst a city block, which the camera zooms out further to reveal the entirety of the city. This zooming out continues. You next see an entire geographical area and then next an entire continent. Okay, so we’ll do that same kind of panoramic envisioning, but in a different context. You are one person that is driving on a city street. We zoom out and there are lots of other cars also driving on that same city street. We continue to zoom out and can see lots and lots of cars throughout the entire city, all being driven by a human at the wheel. Keep zooming out and you’ll see cars being driven throughout an entire geographical region and then throughout the entire United States. There are around 250 million registered automobiles in the United States. Of course, at any singular point in time, not all of them are necessarily underway. We do keep our cars parked and ostensibly stationary for about 95% or more of their available usage time. In any case, when we do use our cars, the aggregate number of miles traveled annually is estimated at 3.2 trillion miles (in the United States alone). A typical everyday driver probably drives around 12,000 miles per year, which varies depending upon where you live and what type of work you do. What does this driving-related zoom-in to zoom-out visioning get us? The choices that we make as drivers in the microscopic acts of driving are inevitably a virtual kind of collective conglomeration. By adding up all those seemingly minuscule acts, we can begin to potentially detect patterns of widespread behaviors. Those patterns can reveal that the day-to-day moment-to-moment driving decisions might overall be increasing our risks while driving a car or can possibly be reducing our risks, contingent on what choices are being made. Let’s use an example to go from the considered microscopic to the macroscopic. Doing so will provide handy fodder to turn this discussion from somewhat theory-based to one that is imminently practical and provides pragmatic insights for us all. You are once again at the wheel of a car and driving along in a city that has the usual hustle and bustle taking place. There are other cars around you. Pedestrians are on the sidewalks, and some are jaywalking across the busy streets. Bike riders are amidst all this chaos. The usual zoo of wild and crazy traffic endangerment exists. Just another day in paradise, as they say. Being late for getting to work, you are driving with a bit of a strident rush in mind. This does not imply that you are recklessly driving. It is just that you are driving with a certain amount of verve and zest, hoping to shave some time off your daily commute to the office. Perhaps this can be characterized as undoubtedly not driving in a lackadaisical manner. You are driving with a fervently determined goal to try and beat the clock as best you can. We can now layout a specific driving scenario. At one point during your driving trek, you are in a major artery of the city that has two lanes going in each direction, making that a total of four lanes (two lanes going southbound, plus two other lanes going northbound). You are in the northbound lanes.  For the moment, you are in the rightmost lane of those two northbound lanes. Traffic is running along smoothly but busily so. Speeds are around 45 miles per hour. In addition to the lanes of car traffic, there is a bike lane on your side of the street. The bike lane is to your right. Bike riders are actively using that bike lane. The time of day is around rush hour and thus many cars and trucks are flowing along in traffic. Plus, there are lots of bike riders occupying the bike lane. Hopefully, you’ve got a pretty good picture in your mind of the driving setting. Suddenly, you realize that a large truck, one of those massively sized moving vans has incrementally come up beside your car, doing so to your left (and ergo in the northbound left lane). The truck is blocking your view of the southbound lanes, but that’s okay since you don’t need to see the traffic that is heading in the opposite direction of your travel.  In a sense, you are now trapped in your right lane. To your left is this big lurking truck. There is traffic directly ahead of you in your right lane. There is traffic behind you in your right lane. You have your own little pocket, as it were, sitting tightly squeezed between all those other interlopers.  And there is the bike lane to be considered too. Please keep in mind that you are flowing along at around 45 miles per hour. Your vehicle is in motion. All the other cars and the truck next to you are also in motion. Turns out that there are bike riders in the bike lane, and they too are in motion. Here’s what comes next. The moving van is veering somewhat in its lane. The driver of the truck is having a hard time keeping the lengthy and slightly erratic vehicle entirely and solely in its own lane. This is a largely unwieldy truck and the roadway is not the best. The lanes are slightly askew and the roadway surface is rather rough.  Meanwhile, some of the bike riders decide they are being held back by some slower bike riders ahead of them.  As such, several of these urgently pressing bikers are opting to pass the slower ones. The act of passing them though is going to bunch them all up for a few split seconds, essentially completely occupying the entire width of the bike lane. Indeed, the odds are that some of the bike riders are going to slop over into the regular lane of traffic as they make their dicey and rapid movement around the slowpoke bike riders. Are you ready to make a snap-driving decision? The everyday squeeze play has become the ultra-squeeze play. You can try to stay squarely in the middle of your lane.  In that case, you are hoping that there is sufficient clearance for the swaying truck (coming somewhat toward you, from your left) and enough clearance for those bikes that are bulging out of the bike lane and into your lane of traffic (coming somewhat toward you, from your right). Or you might decide to ride toward the edge of your lane.  Which edge? Do you choose to align with the right edge or the left edge of your lane? By choosing the right edge, doing so would keep you further away from the truck, at least as much as is feasible at this juncture. That truck is an imposing figure and rather painstakingly foreboding. It is extremely bulky and heavy, for which a glancing blow from the truck into your underway car is bound to be grievously problematic, possibly even fatal. You might be wise to give the most clearance that you can to the wayward truck.  Thus, you aim your car toward the rightmost edge of your lane. This makes perfectly good sense. Whoa, don’t forget about those bike riders! The bike riders are extremely vulnerable.  The odds are that if you brushed against a bike rider, it would be really bad times for that person. In fact, by striking one of them, there is a notable chance that several of the bike riders would go down to the ground all at the same time, akin to a bowling ball striking bowling pins. Those battered bike riders would undoubtedly get hurt, and there is a chance of fatalities depending upon how things go. You are now in the proverbial situation of being between a rock and hard place. One decision entails trying to stay afield of the menacing truck. This is probably safer for you. A collision with that truck is likely to be lethal to you. But you abundantly need to decide between staying afield of those bike riders too. On a somewhat selfish basis, there is little doubt that colliding with the bike riders would probably not be especially injurious to you. Sadly, it would most likely be severely injurious if not fatal to them. Choices, choices, choices. Some might assert that it is up to fate to decide. Just stay in the middle of your lane. Whatever happens, is whatever is going to happen. Don’t be sweating it. You are rightfully able to be in your lane and by staying in the middle you will always have a clear conscience about what you did. Maybe so, maybe not. Suppose you do remain in the middle. It could be that the truck marginally veers into your lane and rams into your car. Had you been just a tad toward the right edge of your lane, the truck and your car would have never touched each other. Because you opted to doggedly be in the middle of your lane, the collision takes place. Bad news for you.  The point is that none of the options are risk-free and nor are any of them outcome-free.  Whichever choice you make, it could turn out to be the “wrong” choice in terms of having an adverse result. Driving is a game of playing the odds, though by referring to the matter as a “game” we need to realize that this is a life-or-death gambit. It is not a playful game. It is a serious contest encompassing probabilities and erstwhile chances that can turn an innocent moment into a heart-wrenching and irreversibly unfavorable one. Which choice did you make? I don’t want you to be thinking that there is a wrong choice or a right choice per se. That’s not what the scenario is trying to portend. The emphasis of this setting is that you are being called upon throughout a driving journey to make essential driving decisions. Those driving decisions are vital. You often make them in a split second. They come and go, like a river that flows endlessly.  Most of the time, those driving decisions are not especially notable. In this case, perhaps you stayed in the middle and everything turned out okay, or maybe you went to the right edge or the left edge, and everything turned out okay. I would dare say that you would not likely remember the next day that you had that precipitous decision to make.  If you tried to remember all the hundreds or thousands of driving choices in each driving trek, you’d probably go bonkers. It just isn’t a reasonable thing to do. Sure, some of the more monumental ones will probably stick with you. For example, this particular scenario could stay in your mindset for a long time, especially if it was a real squeaker and the situation flared to a point of nearly having gotten struck or nearly having struck a bike rider. Assuming that no one got hurt and there was no collision of any kind, the chances are that this instance would eventually recede in your memory banks. You might recall it from time to time, particularly if telling tall tales about some of your harrowing driving experiences. Shift gears a little bit and let’s zoom-out, akin to the zoom-out notion earlier postulated. You aren’t the only one to have ever been in a situation like this. Being pinned between the wayward truck and those boisterous bike riders is undoubtedly something that happens with some frequency. It happens each day. It happens in your city, and it happens in many other locales.  Consider that daily, zillions of drivers are making the same decision that you were just confronted with. This happens throughout the day. It happens over a period of a year, over and over again. We could end up with zillions upon zillions of those specific decisions being made.  Here is the kicker. If those drivers all made independent decisions, we would expect that presumably there might be an equal chance of staying in the middle versus going toward the right edge or the left edge. We could look at a statistical distribution and see that in the aggregate there was an equal chance of which way drivers were opting to go. On the other hand, drivers might have a propensity or specific tendency that would become apparent by examining the aggregated instance. Suppose that the numbers showed that by and large, the drivers went to the right edge. Overall they seemed to be choosing to get away from the truck, though this was simultaneously increasing the risks of hitting the bike riders. In any real-world sense of things, we do not have any practical means to ferret out this kind of decision-making in the aggregate.  We aren’t able to collect the zillions of daily driving decisions being made by each driver, and we cannot then add those up into a convenient database that would show us all of the zillions upon zillions of those itty-bitty driving decisions made by the over 225 million licensed drivers in the United States. That’s a darned shame. Wait for a second, wave a magic wand, and pretend that we could collect that humongous dataset.  This would enable all sorts of insightful analyses on driving and driver behaviors. We might discover that human drivers are more prone to making one type of decision over another and that this had heightened their risk of incurring a car crash. We could then try to educate drivers accordingly, aiming to change behavior toward being less risk-prone. We might redesign our cars or at least the driving controls, accordingly. We might alter the roadways and our infrastructure, doing so to minimize the bad choices and maximize the good choices.  That kind of data collection and analysis could make a big difference in reducing the number of annual injuries and fatalities associated with driving a car. Sorry to say though that we don’t have a magic wand, but we do have something nearly “magical” that is gradually arising, namely the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars. Let’s talk about self-driving cars. The future of cars consists of AI-based true self-driving cars. There isn’t a human driver involved in a true self-driving car. Keep in mind that true self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle. For my extensive and ongoing coverage of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and especially self-driving cars, see the link here. Here’s an intriguing question that is worth pondering: How might driving decisions at the micro-level and also at the macroscopic aggregated level be pertinent to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars? We’ll consider quite mindfully this hearty question. First, I’d like to further clarify what is meant when I refer to true self-driving cars. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.  These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.  Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.  You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. Self-Driving Cars And The Statistical Trolley Dilemma For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.  Why is this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient? Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet. With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car. Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic. Driving a car is tantamount to making ongoing life-or-death decisions, as noted earlier in this discussion.  The elaborated example of being squeezed between a large truck to your left and those bike riders to your right was a simple and yet commonly encountered instance of life-or-death driving choices. The lives involved or on the line can include the driver of the car, the passengers that might be in that car, the drivers of nearby cars, the passengers inside those nearby cars, pedestrians nearby, bike riders nearby, and so on.  Some would arguably contend that life-or-death driving decisions are extremely rare.  Their viewpoint is that maybe once in a lifetime as a driver you might come upon a situation that incorporates life-or-death choices. Otherwise, for some 99.999% of your driving experiences, you won’t presumably have any such grave matters to consider. This is an extremely offbeat way to characterize driving a multi-ton vehicle that is able to move at tremendous speeds and convey enormous physical forces. I submit that we indeed are all faced most of the time with life-or-death driving choices. It is perhaps 99.999% of the time that we, fortunately, make the correct or sufficiently apt decisions and avert getting into dire circumstances.  Despite having managed to deviate away from the grim reaper much of the time, the struggle confronting imminent life-or-death while driving, or shall we also say at least the possibility of injury-or-noninjury is a constant one and not an oddball rarity. There is a famous or some would say infamous mind-bending exercise known as the Trolley Problem that has garnered a great deal of debate and angst in the self-driving car industry and pertains to the weighty decisions involved in driving a car. See my extensive discussion about the Trolley Problem at this link here. Many pundits and vendors in the self-driving car niche are quick to claim that the Trolley Problem is irrelevant to the advent of self-driving cars. They decry the Trolly Problem as purely theoretical, impractical, and a nonsensical distractor from the realities of driverless cars. Those making such an argument are flat-out wrong. They either misunderstand how to apply the Trolley Problem to the matter of self-driving cars or they are wishful that it should not be considered applicable. Their wishful thinking at this time allows them to disregard or downplay the issues raised. This in turn can provide a basis for not seeking to encompass Trolley Problem-related solutions into their AI driving systems.  I’ve predicted that those that take a head-in-the-sand approach to this topic will find themselves and their companies on the legal hook down the road. Eventually, there are going to be gargantuan lawsuits against many of the automakers and self-driving tech firms on their paucity of Trolley Problem considerations. Only then will they apparently take seriously the Trolley Problem, though it will assuredly be the case that they will still fight against it tooth-and-nail, hoping to avoid mega-sized legal losses. As a quick primer about the Trolley Problem, it is a relatively straightforward thought experiment. Imagine that you are standing at a train track and have access to a control that will shunt a trolley onto one of two forking tracks. On one of the forked tracks is a person that is tied down to the rails and cannot getaway. On the other forked track, there are three people tied down to the rails and unable to escape (the number of people tied down varies by how the setup is envisioned, sometimes five people are mentioned rather than three, etc.).  Which direction do you decide to send the oncoming trolley? It is a devilish problem. You are either going to choose to kill one person or three people. The inclination by some is that they won’t move the switch at all, thereby avoiding having to make a choice. That’s not really a means to avoid the issue since the switch is already preset to go onto one track or the other. Your attempt to avoid being involved will nonetheless still produce death. I won’t get into all of the details herein, so see my discussion at this link here. The main point is that you are at times faced with very difficult life-or-death situations, and you need to make the most horrible of choices. In a similar way, the example of being squeezed between the large truck and the bike riders was a Trolley Problem-related consideration.  You had to choose from which was more or less unfavorable. The only notable difference per se with the Trolley Problem was that death in this real-world setting was not an absolute certainty. There was a probability of death, and also a probability associated with injuries. Some would contend that this is why the Trolley Problem is irrelevant, due to the thought experiment entailing only sure-death and not a probability of death. That is a rather feeble argument and there are many variations of the Trolley Problem, including the incorporation of probabilities rather than absolute certainties. Now that I’ve got you up-to-speed about the Trolley Problem, we can return to the aspects of the microscopic elements of driving decisions and the aggregated macroscopic perspective. As notably articulated in a research paper “The Trolley, The Bull Bar, And Why Engineers Should Care About The Ethics Of Autonomous Cars” (authored by Jean-Francois Bonnefon, Azim Shariff, and Iyad Rahwan, published in the Proceedings of the IEEE), there is a Statistical Trolley Dilemma to be considered and ought not to be unheeded: “Alas, ignoring the challenges of autonomous vehicles as explicit ethical agents will only postpone the problem. Even if every action of an autonomous car is oriented toward minimizing the absolute risk of a crash, each action will also shift relative risk from one road user to another. The cars may not be making decisions between outright sacrificing the lives of some to preserve those of others, but they will be making decisions about who is put at marginally more risk of being sacrificed.” Upon examining the use case of a driver caught between a large truck and a bike rider, along with implied reference to all sorts of akin driving situations, they saliently point out that: “These are not the dramatic, life and death decisions featured in trolley dilemmas. But once they are aggregated over millions of cars driving billions of miles, these small statistical decisions add up to life and death consequences—and prompt the same questions as the trolley dilemma did.” In a manner of speaking, I would assert that the Trolley Problem does apply to the microscopic day-to-day moment-to-moment life-or-death driving decisions that we make continually while at the steering wheel and that furthermore we need to also recognize the Statistical Trolley Dilemma on a macroscopic scale too.  This is latter aspect is assuredly the accumulation of zillions upon zillions of those day-to-day Trolley Problem instances that add up over time and constitute large-scale aggregated patterns of driving behaviors. Conclusion Trying to get human drivers to be contemplative about the Trolley Problem and ergo adjust their driving behavior is a nearly futile dreamy notion. Humans tend to be resistant to change and have a hard time adopting new driving practices.  For the semi-autonomous vehicles such as at Level 2 and Level 3, there is an opportunity to have the assisted driving features attempt to aid a human driver by incorporating Trolley Problem related solving capabilities. The automation providing driving assistance could seek to alert human drivers, possibly even overtaking the driving controls. I’ve though covered this extensively as a dicey proposition that can lead to a tug-of-war between a human driver and the assisting automation. It is going to be ugly and assuredly a can of worms. AI-based true self-driving cars are a different matter since there is no human driver at the wheel. This means that we can expect that the AI driving system will be considering Trolley Problem issues. When a car crash or collision occurs involving a self-driving car, we ought to be able to do a full analysis of what the AI driving system was doing and what decisions it made during the incident at hand.  On a large-scale basis, we could accumulate these AI driving system aspects into a centralized database that could be used to study what seems to be working well and what seems to be not quite going so well. Some have suggested that we might need to establish an ethics-oriented oversight board that entails examining the programming of AI driving systems and to what degree the Trolley Problem is being addressed (see my column coverage). Here’s a final remark to give you something significant to ponder.  If we could essentially force all self-driving cars to abide by some set of driving rules, such that in the case of being squeezed between say a large truck and a bunch of bike riders, the AI driving system would do as it has been collectively established to do, what would we want that rule to be?  That’s the kind of decision that some people would skittishly say is above their paygrade. Maybe so, but it certainly ought to not be left to chance by some semi-random choosing AI algorithm, or be in the hands of some overworked AI programmer that while in the throes of coding up the AI made a life-or-death prior decision about how the AI driving system is going to react.  Those are decidedly scary defaults. I doubt that any of us would want our lives teetering on the balance by such loosely or poorly determined and altogether careless and mindless proclivities.  I wouldn’t and neither should you.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2021/09/08/ai-self-driving-cars-and-the-looming-aggregated-statistical-trolley-dilemma/,AI Self-Driving Cars And The Looming Aggregated Statistical Trolley Dilemma
"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 12: Singer Halsey attends The 59th GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Center on ... [+] February 12, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS) For a while, it looked like Halsey was headed toward another No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The singer-songwriter announced their new full-length If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power weeks before it arrived, but just two days after it hit digital storefronts and streaming platforms, the set was forced to compete with Kanye West’s Donda. The rapper’s latest was supposed to come out weeks prior, but the hip-hop musician kept altering the tracklist and making changes to each song, delaying it many times over. This week, Donda rules the Billboard 200, keeping Halsey from the top spot, but the multi-genre musician does manage to dominate another ranking in a fashion very few could hope to come close to. All 13 songs featured on If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power debut on the latest Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, Billboard’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed tunes that can be described as either style of music. The superstar easily claims the most real estate this time around, and they manage to occupy a little more than 25% of the entire list simultaneously, a showing that is reserved for only the biggest talents in the business. Just one track from If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power manages to break into the top 10 on this week’s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, with lead single “I Am Not A Woman, I'm A God” launching at No. 6. The cut wasn’t released ahead of the album’s street date, but it has been identified as both the most popular track on the project and the first tune that will receive a promotional push. All but two of Halsey’s new charting hits appear inside the top 40 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, making them quick hits. Only “The Lighthouse” (No. 43) and “Ya'aburnee” (No. 45) fail to break into the important region, at least for now. Here is a look at where all of Halsey’s new releases rank on this week’s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. No. 6 - “I Am Not A Woman, I'm A God” No. 18 - “Lilith” No. 20 - “The Tradition” No. 23 - “Bells In Santa Fe” No. 27 - “Easier Than Lying” No. 29 - “Darling” No. 30 - “You Asked For This” No. 31 - “Honey” No. 32 - “1121” No. 35 - “Girl Is A Fun”  No. 39 - “Whispers” No. 43 - “The Lighthouse” No. 45 - “Ya'aburnee”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/halsey-conquers-billboards-rock-chart-like-few-before-ever-have/,Halsey Conquers Billboard’s Rock Chart Like Few Before Ever Have
"The World Health Organization is calling for a moratorium on the widespread distribution of Covid-19 booster shots through the end of this year, the group’s head said Wednesday, arguing wealthy countries are not doing enough to vaccinate “at risk people around the world who are yet to receive their first dose.” World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus gestures during a press ...

(Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last month called for a two-month halt on countries offering booster shots, but said at a press conference Wednesday morning he has seen “little change in the global situation since then.” More countries have started introducing booster programs and “the inequitable distribution of life-saving tools is driving a two-track pandemic,” Tedros said.  He noted that just 15% of the 1 billion vaccine doses promised by wealthy countries to be distributed to low and-middle-income nations through the United Nations-backed COVAX program have so far materialized. For that reason, the WHO is asking countries to wait until 2022 to start offering third doses to “healthy people who are fully vaccinated,” Tedros said, adding: “We don’t want any more promises ... We just want the vaccines.”  He pointed out that research so far only supports people who are immunocompromised getting an additional shot of the vaccine as the approved vaccines remain highly effective at protecting against severe disease and death.  “Third doses may be necessary for the most at-risk populations where there is evidence of waning immunity,” Tedros said. “But for now, we do not want to see widespread use of boosters for healthy people.”  80%. That’s how many of the 5 billion vaccine doses administered to date globally went to high and upper-middle-income countries, according to Tedros.  A growing number of wealthy countries, including the United States, have moved to offer vaccine top-ups despite ongoing debate over whether they are necessary. As they unveiled their plan to start rolling out a third dose in September (pending FDA and CDC approval), U.S. officials cited data showing diminishing protection against mild and moderate illness from the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines more than six months after inoculation. “We are concerned this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,” explained U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. However, other experts have argued that countries pursuing boosters are making decisions prematurely based on incomplete data. There has been research suggesting the protection against infection offered by vaccines wanes over time. However, studies indicate the vaccines remain highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization and death.  Experts have warned that unequal vaccine distribution could lead to the emergence of more dangerous variants. “More potent variants” could emerge if the virus gets “the chance to circulate in countries with low vaccine coverage,” Tedros said when calling for the two-month moratorium last month. “U.S. To Begin Offering Booster Shots While These Countries Have Barely Begun Covid Vaccinations” (Forbes)  “When Can You Get A Covid-19 Booster Shot?” (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/who-calls-for-pause-on-covid-booster-shots-until-2022/,WHO Calls For Pause On Covid Booster Shots Until 2022
"Buccaneers assistant defensive line coach Lori Locust became one of the first female coaches to win ... [+] a Super Bowl last season. Historic is a deceiving adjective. Earlier this year, Jennifer King was promoted to the Washington Football Team’s assistant running backs coach, making her the NFL’s first Black female assistant coach. She was followed by Natalia Dorantes, who took over as the WFT’s coordinator of football programs a few months later, making her the first Latina to hold that role in NFL history. Elsewhere in the league, Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant defensive line coach Lori Locust and assistant strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar became the first women to win a Super Bowl in the 2020 season. One year earlier, San Francisco’s Katie Sowers made history as the first woman to play for the Lombardi Trophy. There were eight female coaches in the NFL last season and six advanced to the playoffs. The Women’s Career in Football Forum, which is a two-day event that began in 2017 that takes place during the NFL combine, announced on August 20 that the 2021 season will feature the most female coaches in NFL history at 12.  The WCFF secured 174 opportunities for women and resulted in 21 hirings around the league. Sam Rapoport, the NFL’s senior director of diversity, equity and inclusion, announced that of the participants who have secured a position this season, 83% are women of color. Last season, women reached an all-time high of 38.2% of league office roles. So far in 2021 alone, 44 women who have previously participated in the WCFF program have landed a football operations role at the professional or collegiate level, the highest number ever for the WCFF program in a single year, according to the NFL. The numbers are significant because of their absence from history. Opportunities for women to be the first at something in the NFL are dwindling and words like “trailblazer” and “pioneer” are being shelved away. But the historic shift in the number of female coaches in the NFL is also important because of timing. Last July, the Washington Post released its first article detailing the harassment allegations of 15 former Washington Football Team employees and two female journalists from 2006 to 2019. Then in August, a new Post story detailed allegations by an additional 25 women who used to work for the organization. As history continues to repeat itself, it’s important that it also be made. Three-hundred and fifty nine days after the publication of that second Post story, the WCFF announced its findings.  The 12 female coaches in 2021 represent a much-needed source of hope during another tumultuous summer for the NFL. Last month, the league announced its findings on the Washington Football Team in which no allegation against owner Daniel Snyder was addressed, and a $10 million fine was requested. This summer, Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has been the subject of several investigations and 22 civil lawsuits as he faces allegations ranging from inappropriate conduct to sexual assault.  For these reasons, when the NFL opens its 2021 season September 9 with a game featuring the Super-Bowl-defending Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys, the sight of Lori Locust and Maral Javadifar on the sideline is powerful as women in and around the league continue to fight for their place in it. “I do look forward to the day that it’s no longer newsworthy to be a woman working in the pros or making the Super Bowl for that matter,” Javadifar said prior to Super Bowl LV. “And, you know, I hope we get to a point where all people are afforded equal opportunities to work in professional sports because there are a lot of great qualified coaches out there.” At the same media availability, Locust said that she does not focus on being the first because her primary concern is helping the team win. “It wouldn’t matter if we were second in or 273rd,” Locust said. “And I mean, like we acknowledge the fact there hasn’t been many before us, but it’s not anything that we kind of keep in the forefront of what we do on a daily basis.” Their head coach, Bruce Arians, hired the first female coaching intern in 2015 with Jen Welter in Arizona. Now there are many more. Sarah Hogan, the assistant director of coaching operations for the Atlanta Falcons. Robyn Wilkey, the executive assistant to the head coach for the Chicago Bears. The Philadelphia Eagles promoted Catherine Raîche to the vice president of football operations last season, making her the highest-ranking woman in personnel in NFL history at the time. Carolina Panthers Executive Assistant Morgan Fleming. Callie Brownson, the Chief of Staff for the Cleveland Browns. Baltimore Ravens Director of Football Operations Megan McLaughlin.

"Emily Pickrell, UH Energy Scholar TIANJIN, CHINA - APRIL 13: Aerial view of the construction site of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) ... [+] terminal operated by Beijing Gas Group Company Limited on April 13, 2021 in Tianjin, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) When it comes to energy, a geography rich with natural resources has its perks. While Japan is currently paying close to $10 per metric million British thermal units (MMBtu) for the natural gas it imports, one luxury of our country’s shale boom is the way it has created really low natural gas prices. Prices were once up to $13 per MMBtu as recently as the last decade, but since 2014, they have mostly stayed in the two-to-three dollar range.  Yet this year, domestic natural gas prices have again been climbing up, even though predictions remain that we have enough natural gas resources to last us decades.  Last month, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price hit $4.07 per MMBtu, the highest summertime rate since 2014.  And even that’s not the highest rate at the Henry Hub this year - it reached $5.35 per MMBtu in February, driven by the cold spell that month in several central states. In Texas, Houston Ship Channel spot prices shot up to $400 per MMBtu on February 16, raising financial chaos in the Texas power markets.  Yet, the persistence of these higher prices, long after the cold spell, indicates that more than just a freak storm is at play. “During this hot summer across the U.S., natural gas supplies - including stored natural gas - have been drawn down more than usual,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston. “These relatively higher prices are likely to persist through to the spring as natural gas storage facilities replenish their supplies.” Domestic natural gas comes from two types of sources. The first category consists of hydrocarbon reservoirs that are predominantly natural gas such as Haynesville shale, the Marcellus shale, and the Utica shale. But it is also an associated product of crude oil in places like the Permian Basin, meaning that a significant portion of natural gas supply is tied to the production of oil and drilling in the oilfields.  The shale revolution drove the drilling of many such wells with the associated gas produced, creating a glut of natural gas.  During the pandemic, the contraction of oil production in places like the Permian shale last year also reduced the supply of accompanying natural gas.  Despite this contraction, prices quickly fell to $1.63 per MMBtu in June 2020. It was triggered by the drop in manufacturing that had been caused by the pandemic-related disruption to supply chains.  Yet this where the reasons behind natural gas pricing gets a little more complicated. For while the pandemic had an immediate downward impact, the overall U.S. demand for natural gas has been growing. The U.S. currently produces and consumes about 31.5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btus) of natural gas, up from 24.5 quadrillion Btus in 2010.   This raises the question of how domestic supply is responding to this expected demand increase. If the Permian does not recover to prior levels of activity, and it is not expected to do so, those companies that are primarily natural gas producers in the Haynesville, Marcellus, and Utica will increase their drilling activity. Even George Mitchell’s original gas shale play in the Barnett shale will see new activity.  If oil prices remain in the $70 per barrel level, growth in oil production may resume and may increase the supply of natural gas.   What other factors are driving the recent natural gas price increases? In the short term, the polar vortex of 2021 followed by the hottest summer on record in the U.S. have driven down gas supplies in storage. The recovery from the pandemic recession is also driving domestic gas demand. Continued domestic economic growth is on the horizon as the EIA predicts that the industrial sector will increase gas demand by 35 percent by 2050, and make up more than 75 percent of its overall expected 4.6 quadrillion Btu demand growth.  Regionally, insufficient pipeline infrastructure also impacts natural gas prices. Boston, for example, pays the same price as those in Japan, because of a lack of pipelines to the Northeast, leaving it to import natural gas via liquified natural gas (LNG) tankers.   The Permian Basin in Texas has the opposite problem. The low natural gas prices combined with a lack of infrastructure in place has led to the flaring of much of its gas: 900 billion Btu over a year in 2019. At current prices, the value of this flared natural gas would be well over $1 billion.  At some point, throwing gas away because the cost of pipelines don’t justify themselves will no longer make economic sense (if it currently does). The push for more electrification as a solution to climate change will also increase demand, but in the immediate future is not considered to be significant enough to drive price increases.  This is also the case with natural gas exports: The U.S. now exports an average of 6.6 trillion Btu per day of LNG, according to the EIA. That’s a big number, but still relatively small compared to the 82.5 trillion Btu per day in 2021 that the U.S. consumes domestically.  Mexico is also buying a lot more U.S. natural gas than it did a decade ago.  It has made a big shift in the last decade towards U.S. (mostly from Texas) natural gas for its power and manufacturing needs. Mexico now imports about 65% of its natural gas from Texas - 7.6 trillion Btu per day - through the multi-billion-dollar pipelines built up. These exports to Mexico are expected to reach 9.1 trillion Btu per day by 2025.  A global growth in demand for LNG is also tapping U.S. reserves. The U.S. is now exporting more LNG than the gas it transports to Mexico and Canada via pipelines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. LNG exports are expected to reach 8.5 Btu/d in 2021 and 9.2 Btu/d in 2022, the EIA said. This global LNG market is a fairly recent phenomenon, driven by a rapidly increasing demand from China, Korea and India, all of which have transformed their economies in the last generation.    Other mature economies, including Japan and Europe, are increasing their use of LNG as a bridge fuel as they try to reduce their carbon footprint.  Yet while prices are up this year, most energy analysts expect that the huge U.S. reserves of natural gas and the technology to access it will eventually even out, keeping prices relatively stable below five dollars for a MMBTU in the years to come.  “As natural gas prices firm up, some northeast guys will increase production, and that will offset the exports sent out of the country,” Jamison Cocklin, a senior editor at Natural Gas Intelligence, said. “Natural gas prices are more balanced in that sense.” Emily Pickrell is a veteran energy reporter, with more than 12 years of experience covering everything from oil fields to industrial water policy to the latest on Mexican climate change laws.

"Oil, gas and coal extraction will need to be sharply curtailed in order to keep global warming to the 1.5C limit outlined by the Paris climate agreement, according to a new study published in Nature Tuesday, underscoring long-standing warnings and evidence of the need for drastic and immediate action to stave off the impending climate crisis.   A model indicates much more drastic reductions to fossil fuel extraction are needed to meet the ... [+] Paris agreement limit. In order to have a 50% chance of meeting the 1.5C target, nearly 60% of global oil and fossil methane gas reserves and 90% of coal reserves will need to be left in the ground, according to modeling by researchers at University College London.  Global oil and gas production would have to decrease 3% every year in order to meet the ambitious goal (coal production peaked in 2013), the researchers found, though this is not distributed evenly across producing regions. Much greater reserves of oil must be maintained in Canada (83%), Europe (72%) and Central and South America (73%), for example, and greater reserves of coal must be kept in Russia and former Soviet states (97%) and the Middle East (100%).  The U.S. is the only oil-producing region not set for an immediate and steep decline towards 2050, the model predicts, with production slated to peak in 2025 due to falling imports, more flexible means of oil production and the country’s continued use of oil in the transport sector before strong growth in low-emissions technology.    The vast majority (97%) of American coal reserves must remain in the ground, according to the model, and gas production will fall annually by 8.1% before the fossil fuel is completely phased out by the power sector in 2040.  The researchers note their work probably underestimates the scale of the changes required given uncertainties over the deployment of green technology and the need for even more carbon to remain in the ground to have a greater than 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5C warming. The findings are a marked increase from the carbon budget set by earlier research in 2015, which estimated a third of oil, almost half of gas and more than 80% of coal reserves would need to stay in the ground by 2050 to limit global warming to 2C. The University College London model indicates drastic and swift cuts to production which many regions would need to be facing now or in the very near future. The finding echoes those of the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate science authority whose work underpinned the internationally agreed upon 1.5C limit. In its most recent report, the IPCC decisively attributed global warming to human activity—1.1C of which to greenhouse gases emitted since the second half of the 19th century—and warned temperatures would likely exceed the 1.5C limit within the next 20 years unless action to reduce emissions was taken.  The downturn in oil and gas demand during the Covid-19 pandemic “provides an opportune moment for governments to shift strategy,” the researchers wrote, calling on the governments that have “historically benefited” to “take the lead” in a move towards greener energy sources. The International Energy Agency has already issued a warning that energy demand is rebounding from its pandemic lows. Impressive growth in clean energy will not be sufficient to meet this demand, the organization warned.  Unextractable fossil fuels in a 1.5 °C world (Nature) Climate Goals At Risk As Surging Energy Demand Outpaces Growth In Renewables, IEA Warns (Forbes) ‘Code Red For Humanity’: Humans Driving ‘Unprecedented’ Climate Change, U.N.

(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) France fields a powerful military with sophisticated capabilities, including advanced jets, well-trained commandos and nuclear weapons. But the French military is also fragile, lacking reserves of munitions and manpower for a sustained conflict with Russia, according to a study by a U.S. think tank.  “France currently possesses one of Western Europe’s most capable militaries, owing to the country’s commitment to maintaining as wide a range of military capabilities as possible and preserving its capacity to handle any kind of conflict, including high-intensity conventional warfare, without the necessity of allies,” according to a report by U.S. think tank RAND Corp. France has always been the odd bird of the Western alliance. A founding member of NATO in 1949, it withdrew its troops from NATO command in 1966 – only to rejoin in 2009. Mindful of its history as a great power – the armies of Louis XIV and Napoleon once dominated Europe – France since 1945 has pursued a fiercely independent foreign policy that has sometimes exasperated U.S. leaders. But facing possible conflict with Moscow over Eastern Europe and the Baltic States – and with the U.S. calling for Europe to spend more on its own defense – NATO needs all the help it can get.  France is well-positioned to help. With around 300,000 active-duty military personnel backed by the world’s seventh-largest economy, France boasts an impressive range of capabilities for a medium-sized power. Its Leclerc tanks, Rafale jet fighters and CAESAR 155-millimeter self-propelled howitzers are in the same league as advanced American or Russian equipment. France has a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and four nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear-tipped ICBMs, as well as spy satellites and cyberwarfare capabilities.  France’s problem isn’t breadth of capabilities, but depth. Not just limited numbers of weapons and munitions, but also crucial support services, such as electronic warfare, air defense and airlift capacity.  “France’s capacity to sustain a high-end, conventional conflict is limited,” RAND said. “The French military might be able to accomplish all its assigned missions at once, but it lacks depth, meaning that such demanding operations would quickly exhaust both its human and material resources.” Ironically, while France and America have had their squabbles, both find themselves caught in the same dilemma. Like the U.S. military, the French armed forces entered the post-9/11 era configured for Cold War mechanized combat. And like the U.S. military, they had to reorient themselves for counterinsurgency warfare. For years, France has been fighting Islamic militants in the former French colonies in the Sahel — or Saharan — region of Africa, including the nations of Mali, Mauritania, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso. Since Operation Barkhane began in 2014, up to 5,000 French soldiers have been deployed in Africa, as well as small numbers of troops fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

[+] (Improvised Explosive Devices) during the Burkhane Operation in northern Burkina Faso on November 12, 2019. - (Photo by MICHELE CATTANI/AFP via Getty Images) But in June 2021, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Operation Barkhane would end, though France will still maintain a military presence in the Sahel. France now has to prepare for both major-power conflict and small wars.  The result is that the French military is designed for segment median, or “middle-segment” warfare, defined as “heavy enough to survive on a conventional battlefield yet light enough to remain expeditionary—i.e., deployable to austere environments, such as Mali, in the absence of ample logistical capabilities,” RAND noted. “France has been careful to maintain the ability to do full spectrum operations, including for a conventional war in Europe,” Stephanie Pezard, a RAND researcher who co-authored the study, told me. “However, this ability has not been their main focus over the past few years, resulting recently in a new turn toward high-intensity conflict and the means necessary to wage this type of war.” U.S. leaders such as Donald Trump have long accused Europe of not spending enough on European defense, forcing American taxpayers to pick up the tab. Yet France does see itself as defending Europe – just not in Europe. “The French consider their military’s active overseas operations, especially in the Sahel but also in Iraq and Syria, as burden-sharing—a form of in-kind contribution that enhances NATO and European security even when not conducted under a NATO or European Union mandate,” RAND noted.  Nonetheless, NATO since its inception has focused on the Russian threat. And the French military would be an invaluable asset in a NATO-Russia conflict. “France could support a U.S.-led war in Eastern Europe; it has and is developing the capabilities required to take on a sophisticated peer and help meet some of the needs identified to participate in high-intensity conventional warfare,” RAND noted. But France couldn’t battle Russia for long without U.S. support. “France is able to conduct military operations across the full spectrum of conflict, but it does not have the ability to sustain the fight during a protracted conflict against a highly capable adversary, such as Russia,” said RAND. “From a U.S. perspective, this means that France could participate in a large-scale conventional war in Eastern Europe for a limited time. Several capability areas, such as electronic warfare and air defenses, might benefit from increased U.S.-French collaboration and could improve France’s ability to sustain this type of conflict.” Which leads to an even deeper question: how willing would France be to fight Russia? That depends, says Pezard. “If France becomes convinced that the security situation in Europe warrants a larger presence, then this would likely take precedence over overseas commitments — unless these overseas commitments aim at securing France’s overseas territories. Until France becomes convinced that the situation in Europe warrants more involvement on its part, it will continue to secure the next circle, such as the Mediterranean and the Sahel.” Afghan Commandos May Join The British Army The Fall Of Afghanistan Is Not The Fall Of South Vietnam",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpeck/2021/09/08/frances-military-is-a-powerfulbut-fragileally-against-russia-says-us-study/,"France’s Military Is A Powerful – But Fragile – Ally Against Russia, Says U.S. Study"

Our increasingly connected world means today’s engineers can operate from an office with a world of information at their fingertips. But direct experience is a valuable learning tool. I advise young engineers to leave their desks, speak to customers and spend time getting to know the inner workings of the engineering projects they encounter. Fieldwork is a richly rewarding experience. As a child, I was always playing with Lego building blocks. I loved putting them together to see how they fit, which explains why a career in engineering was an appropriate path for me. My father was a harbor pilot at the Port of Boston, and I shared his love of the sea. I used to spend hours building round-bottomed tugboats out of square plastic blocks, which is an engineering challenge in itself.  My upbringing on the ocean influenced my decision to study at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. While my family expected me to follow in Dad’s footsteps, I decided on a different course and chose to become a licensed power plant engineer.  Todd Emery is Vice President of Aero-derivative Programs & Operations at Mitsubishi Power Aero. Everything pointed to spending a life at sea, yet my career path was actually laid on solid ground. My first job was working as a field engineer with marine and industrial gas turbines. It was an opportunity to join a large company and work with my hands to learn about gas turbines; this proved to be a pivotal decision for the future.  I sensed back then that the path to success started with getting my fingernails dirty, so to speak, and I was excited about the prospect of doing fieldwork. But it was much later that I appreciated the true value of those early experiences operating power plants, connecting the theoretical side of engineering and design with its practical application to real-world projects.  Practical experience offers one of the highest returns on investment that you can make in your career. Everyone respects and appreciates engineers with actual field experience.  Working in the field gave me a crash course in systems problem-solving, knowing what to do when machines break down, when controls or components fail, how to interact with people and how to keep a cool head in a high-pressure environment.  These insights proved invaluable when I moved to an office-based customer service role, which involved regular collaboration with field service engineers to resolve customer issues. My knowledge and practical field experience helped us find new ways to overcome challenges on different projects, instead of relying on narrowly defined textbook solutions. It also earned respect from my colleagues, as an experience-based viewpoint is often regarded as highly credible. Today, as I work with other senior executives to make decisions that involve assessing risk levels, my field operations and maintenance experience allow me to fully understand those risks and add a distinct perspective to the decision-making process. Rarely a day goes by that I am not drawing on my early experiences. That knowledge is with you forever.   Expected to become a harbor pilot like his father, Todd Emery instead trained to be an engineer at the United States Merchant Marine Academy. When starting out, young engineers need to be patient, although this can be a difficult lesson to learn. It takes time to develop the skills and knowledge needed to do a job professionally, but practical experience offers one of the highest returns on investment that you can make in your career. Everyone respects and appreciates engineers with actual field experience. I was advised by a senior colleague to use the ‘three Hs’ approach to professional development: head, heart and hands. It’s sound advice that still holds true today. Use your head to learn all that you can and develop the mental aptitude to make the right decisions; your heart to be compassionate, understand people and demonstrate leadership competence; and your hands to gain practical experience and learn from mistakes. But you don’t have to do it alone as others will help you on your journey. Finding a mentor can help young people benefit from the experience of senior colleagues. It’s a great idea for new engineers to find someone they respect and feel comfortable asking for advice, and do it straightaway. Tapping into that experience can help support and guide your career.  It can be tough for today’s young engineers to break from office life or build networks while working remotely. Not everyone’s life situation enables them to do fieldwork, but that shouldn’t stop you getting involved. Reach out to your manager to explore fieldwork opportunities at an operating plant or construction site, and arrive ready to contribute wherever you’re needed.  A rotation in the field during construction or commissioning is a great and worthwhile opportunity for somebody who’s never experienced it.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitsubishiheavyindustries/2021/09/08/advice-for-young-engineers-learn-in-the-field-not-just-behind-a-desk/,"Advice For Young Engineers: Learn In The Field, Not Just Behind A Desk"
"Call Of Duty We’ve reached the halfway point for Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone Season 5. The big Season 5 Reloaded update goes live later today, though you should be able to download and pre-install the updates to both games already. The Season 5 midseason update brings new maps, modes, Operators and guns to both games, as well as a new special event. Here’s what’s headed to Cold War and Warzone for the second half of the season. The Season 5 Reloaded update will go live at at 9 PM PST/ 11 PM CST on September 8th which translates to midnight for the East Coast on September 9th.  Depending on your platform, the update should be around 9 to 10 GB, though on PC my update last night was closer to 40 GB. Season 5 Reloaded       The Numbers Event Two new modes come to Warzone in this update. The first is Clash, a new take on the big team 50 v 50 mode that’s basically just massive scale TDM. The second, Iron Trials ‘84, amps up the realism in Verdansk. Basically, base health is increased and health regen rates have been tinkered with. No loadout drops fall from the sky, meaning you’ll have to purchase those yourself (at increased prices).  In the Gulag, akimbo pistols and semi/fully auto shotguns are out and there’s very little tactical equipment—but if you win, you’ll drop back into the map with your Gulag loadout, which is a cool twist. Kicking off on September 21st at 10 AM PT/ 12 PM CST/ 1 PM EST, this special event is tied to the mysterious Red Doors players have found all across Verdansk. We know very little about it, but there should be some new challenges and rewards and a continuation of the narrative we’ve been following the past few seasons. Zoo We’ve already gotten several new maps as part of Season 5’s new content, free to all players. Zoo is yet another 6 v 6 map and fans may recognize it as a remaster of the classic Black Ops map from the original game. Along with the new map the classic Demolition mode is headed to Cold War. The round-based mode pits two teams against one another in an attempt to plant and defuse bombs, but unlike Search and Destroy respawns are enabled. Defusing a bomb doesn’t end the round, either—you either explode it or stop it from exploding by the end of the round. New Zombies content includes the Armada Outbreak Region and a new Black Chest Outbreak world event. The new Rampage Inducer item is also being added, allowing for maximum difficulty. Judge Dredd Two new Operators arrive in the Item Shop with the new update. The classic comic book / movie character Judge Dredd joins the ranks of action heroes in Warzone, including John McClane and Rambo. Agent Hudson (who you’ll recall from the Cold War campaign) will also be available for purchase in a bundle. That’s everything! Be sure to check out my impressions of Call Of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer. I joined a bunch of other journalists and influencers last week for a two-and-a-half hour play session and I have mixed feelings. You’ll be able to try out the multiplayer beta starting this weekend and into the next. Stay tuned for more info on that and follow me on Twitter or back me on Patreon if you’re interested in getting a code to this coming weekend’s Early Access beta. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

"PORTLAND, OREGON - DECEMBER 21: Keita Bates-Diop #31 of the Minnesota Timberwolves dribbles with the ... [+] ball in the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers during their game at Moda Center on December 21, 2019 in Portland, Oregon. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Continuing a team-shaping off-season, the San Antonio Spurs re-signed Keita Bates-Diop to a two-year contract, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The young forward was a restricted free agent, so the Spurs could have matched any offer he received. Nonetheless, they reached an agreement before that situation arose ahead of this fall’s training camp. While no other contract details were added, this new deal means Bates-Diop will not play on a two-way contract unless it’s converted. He has a chance at a role, too, acting as wing depth behind Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson, although it’s likely pending Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu’s respective statuses. Both players arrived as salary offsets in the DeMar DeRozan sign-and-trade with the Chicago Bulls, but on a drastically young roster that’s already over the 15-man roster limit, they could each be on the outside looking in before the 2021-22 season starts. The Spurs coincidentally are at 17 players, so they must shed two players before Oct. 18. Waiving Chandler Hutchison earlier this month lowered the total from 18. Bates-Diop should have every chance to make the opening night roster as a young, inexpensive player off the bench. A likely low salary guarantee could also impede his chances, given the team can waive him and eat his salary, especially if nothing is worked out to move Aminu or Young or if they opt to immerse them in the rotation. If so, another two-way deal makes sense for Bates-Diop as the roster situation currently stands. At 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, Bates-Diop fits the mold of a prototypical NBA wing defender. He has mostly fit a depth role along the way, being drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves and playing for the Denver Nuggets before joining the Spurs in 2020-21. The Ohio State product has topped out at 6.5 points and 2.9 rebounds per game in his three-year NBA career. Perhaps he’s not called upon for this due to an abundance of 3-point options, but Bates-Diop has some ability to stretch the floor for San Antonio, averaging a 30.2 percent mark from behind the arc on 1.7 attempts. It seems low, but he improved off 25 percent in his rookie season for 33 percent in 2019-20. 30 games and limited playing time on a two-way contract with the Spurs in 2020-21 limited his field goal output. Bates-Diop’s upside is stepping in at the end of the bench to provide minutes or gain a larger role as an injury replacement. Maybe he surprises and enters head coach Gregg Popovich’s rotation to open the season and is eyed as a defensive weapon, but the abundance of other young options at the staff’s disposal likely prioritizes them, and Aminu and Young potentially sticking around gives them an edge, too. The season is an arm’s length away, though, with preseason games to play and opportunities to seize. Bates-Diop will have a chance to impress before a season of growth and development in the Alamo City.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robwolkenbrod/2021/09/08/san-antonio-spurs-deepen-wing-role-with-keita-bates-diops-return/,San Antonio Spurs Deepen Wing Role With Keita Bates-Diop’s Return
"In the first days of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits in January 1938, men waiting to file ... [+] claims at the California State Employment Service office in San Francisco. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, California has paid out more than $169 billion in UI benefits.  (Return to work has been slow so far, even in the states that ended the federal Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits early. Prior employment research offers ideas on hastening work return.) When the California economy re-opened in mid-June, the expectation was that that the enormous Unemployment Insurance (UI) rolls—over 3 million Californians receiving some form of UI—would start quickly going down. Instead, the numbers did not significantly decrease in more than two months, and as of last week still totaled over 3 million.  This past weekend brought the end of federal benefits in the state, as in more than twenty other states. Roughly 2 million of the 3 million claimants in California will see their benefits end, and the remaining claimants on Regular UI will see the $300 per week federal supplement halted. The end of federal benefits will increase the number of job seekers in the state. However, the experiences of the 25 states that previously ended the federal benefits indicate that the process of getting former UI recipients into jobs will not be that quick or easy. It is timely now to consider some of the policies that have hastened return to work in the past, and the insights of the UI experts at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, the leading research center over the past half century on UI. Let’s start with a word on the current situation. Over the past few months, directors of California’s 45 Local Workforce Boards, the state’s public workforce system, have expressed surprise at the absence of job seekers. “We were expecting an increase in job seekers coming to our Job Centers starting in June, but have not seen it, even as the September 4 deadline neared” observes Blake Konczal, the longtime director of the Fresno Regional Workforce Board. He adds “At the same time, Fresno area employers, especially small businesses, have come to us saying they can’t find enough workers.”  Now that unemployment benefits have ended, Fresno and the other Local Boards will start seeing more candidates. This has occurred in the states that ended unemployment benefits, as a report last week in the Wall Street Journal found. Employers who operate in multiple states told the Journal of the increase in job applicants following the end of federal benefits. Sizzling Platter, a company operating Little Caesars, Dunkin’ Donuts and Red Robin, described an increase in job applicants of 20% in three states which they operate in and which ended the federal benefits.  However, even with the increase in job seekers, the job placement process likely will take time. Several studies have been undertaken, comparing the job gains in states that eliminated benefits with those that did not. A number of the studies, by Goldman Sachs and by the University of Wisconsin found significant job gains with the ending of benefits. Other studies by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and by Indeed.com found more modest differences. A widely cited study led by University of Massachusetts economist Arindrajit Dube found only a modest difference in employment between states ending benefits and those not ending benefits: 26% of workers receiving unemployment benefits in April were employed by July in states that ended benefits compared to 22% in states not ending benefits. Currently, all of the data are preliminary, and we’ll know much more on this issue after the next three months. This week I contacted Christopher O’Leary, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute and longtime researcher and expert on UI. How did he view return to work? What, if any, policies might hasten work return?  O’Leary started by noting the several factors limiting return to work in this recovery beyond UI benefits: ongoing health concerns, ongoing difficulty in obtaining and paying for quality child care, and reconsideration of previous occupations and tasks. Additionally, even with the high number of job openings, the job search process will take time for most workers. The matching of jobs and job seekers by skills, aptitudes and geography is not an immediate process , and the high cost of housing in areas with high labor demand has been an impediment.  One of the return to work policies that O’Leary has studied most closely is the use of financial incentives for claimants to move off UI, particularly the Reemployment Bonus field experiments. The first of these experiments was conducted in Illinois in 1984-85, followed by ones in New Jersey, 1986-87, and the states of Pennsylvania and Washington, 1988. The experiments tested several different forms of bonuses, in large randomized controlled trials run as field experiments to measure impacts.  The Illinois experiment offered a bonus of $500 (representing roughly 3 weeks of UI benefits) for returning to full time employment within 11 weeks after filing for benefits and remaining employed for 4 months. The Pennsylvania and Washington bonuses tested different levels of bonus amounts (in Washington, bonus amounts at 2, 4, and 6 times the claimant’s weekly benefit amount) and different percentages of benefit durations. The New Jersey experiment offered job search assistance, job training, and a bonus amount that declined by 10 percent for each added week of job search. In a 1993 journal article, O’Leary and Upjohn colleagues Robert Spiegelman and Kenneth Kline summarized the findings of the four pilots. The results differed among pilots, though all showed a positive cost-benefit analysis. The Illinois pilot, the first, showed positive gains, even with at the $500 amount. The Washington pilot subgroup with 6 times the weekly benefit amount showed significant gains in employment and reduction in UI payments. Despite the positive impacts, the reemployment bonus was not continued in these states or widely picked up by other states. Over the next few decades, unemployment rolls generally remained low—other than during the Great Recession. But the idea of financial incentives for return to work has resurfaced in the past six months, with states utilizing various bonus payments, ranging from $500-$2000 for UI claimants returning to work. Arizona’s bonus is among the most generous with a $2000 payment after 320 hours of work. These bonus payments were implemented as temporary fixes, but O’Leary believes it is worth experimenting with additional reemployment bonuses if the unemployment rolls remain high. Money that states have received from the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan is eligible for use as incentive payments for return to work. A bonus need not be a lump sum payment, but could be paid in two or more installments, first at time of placement and then after a period of retention. For greatest cost effectiveness, it would be targeted to those on UI most likely to exhaust benefits.  Beyond the reemployment bonus O’Leary also singles out strengthening the job search assistance provided by the Employment Service under the Wagner-Peyser Act. O’Leary notes that the field experiments indicate that when job search is undertaken effectively (providing job leads and employer contacts as well as job search skills) expanding Job Service staff can be a cost-effective use of public fund. In contrast, research evidence suggests that employer hiring incentives have been one of the least effective return to work strategies, mainly due to the low employer take-up. Following the Great Recession, O’Leary urged the rebuilding of the UI system in its role as a re-employment system, not only a benefits system. O’Leary wrote: “The federal-state UI program is now gradually rebuilding system reserves after the Great Recession. Many states were left with billions in debt from paying regular benefits, even though the federal government fully paid for benefit extensions at unprecedented levels. Some states are retreating from accepted standards of UI adequacy with the expectation that the federal government will once again intervene when a new unemployment crisis emerges. However, after welfare reform, all social policy is now employment policy. Making and maintaining connections to the workforce is the only path to self-sufficiency.” This is as still true today, as we rebuild the UI system post pandemic. In recent years, the thrust of policy discussion in California, as elsewhere, has been on universal basic income or income maintenance schemes, that de-couple income from employment. Remaking the UI system into more of a re-employment system is one step to countering this movement.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2021/09/08/the-end-of-federal-unemployment-benefits-and-the-return-to-work/,"The End Of Federal Unemployment Benefits, And The Return To Work"
"Texas’ near-total ban on abortion going into effect is mobilizing more Democrats to make abortion and other issues predominantly affecting women a top priority at the ballot box, a new Morning Consult poll finds, as abortion policy becomes a larger issue at both the state and federal level with lawmakers seeking to combat—or copy—Texas’ legislation. Pro-abortion rights activists protest outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on March 4, ... [+] 2020. The poll found the share of Democratic voters who said issues like abortion, equal pay and contraception are “their top voting concerns” for federal office increased from 5% to 10% after the Texas abortion law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), took effect. Democratic women’s prioritization of those issues went up from 6% to 14%, while among Democratic men it went up from just 2% to 4%. The share of Independents prioritizing abortion and other issues went up from 4% to 6%, including from 7% to 10% among Independent women. Republicans were largely unmoved by the Texas law—just 3% of both Republicans overall and Republican women named abortion and other issues a top concern, versus 2% for both groups before the law took effect. The poll was first conducted August 28-30 and then again from September 4-6—right before and after the law took effect and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on September 1—among 16,507 and 17,494 respondents, respectively. The top concerns for Democratic women are still the economy (25% say it’s a top voting concern) and health care (18%), Morning Consult found. In addition to their support for abortion, the Morning Consult poll also found the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling that allowed SB 8 to remain in effect had a noticeable effect on Americans’ trust in the high court. The poll found 52% of U.S. adults had “a lot” or “some” trust in the Supreme Court in the wake of their Texas ruling, which is down five percentage points from the week before. Men and Republicans have the highest degree of trust in the high court—with 58% and 61% saying they have at least some trust in it, respectively—versus 47% of women, 44% of Independents and 50% of Democrats. The conservative-leaning court ruled late Wednesday night that it was too soon to bring a legal challenge against the Texas law—but did not consider the constitutionality of the law itself—and is also set to hear a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade next term when it takes up a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. SB 8 prohibits abortions starting approximately six weeks into a pregnancy—when a “fetal heartbeat” is detected, though medical experts criticize that term as misleading—and marks the most restrictive abortion law to take effect in the U.S. since the 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade. Unlike similar state-level abortion bans that have all been struck down by the courts, SB 8 seeks to evade legal scrutiny by having private citizens enforce the ban through private lawsuits against anyone that “aids and abets” an abortion. They can also receive at least $10,000 in damages if they’re successful. The law has drawn significant criticism—including among even some Republicans—and is expected to stop approximately 85% of abortions in Texas, with the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute projecting Texans seeking abortions will now have to drive up to 20 times as far to obtain one. The Texas abortion law is already having repercussions nationwide. A growing number of officials in GOP-led states have said they plan to copy Texas’ legislation and enact their own similar abortion bans, including in Florida, Missouri, South Dakota and Arkansas, among others. At the federal level, President Joe Biden has pushed for a “whole-of-government” response to combat the Texas abortion law and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said the U.S. Department of Justice will “protect” those seeking abortions in Texas by enforcing existing federal law and increasing its law enforcement presence in Texas while exploring other potential legal options. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has also said the chamber will take up the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights into federal law, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) urged the Senate Sunday to abolish the filibuster so that the chamber can also pass that legislation.

Miami quarterback D’Eriq King, who is a co-founder of Dreamfield, previously signed the first NIL deal with the Florida Panthers. It was the first NIL deal by a major professional sports team, although several others have now signed student athletes. Corey Staniscia, Dreamfield’s director of external affairs, said the Panthers jumped on the opportunity to work with student athletes from the beginning. “The Panthers were looking to get into the NIL market right away as an early adopter. Being a great community partner is something the Panthers value, so Dreamfield began consulting the Panthers on what are standard and typical deals and how to best leverage NIL.”  Staniscia says the Panthers chose FAU because they wanted to support a hometown university as a way to show their commitment to the community. “The NHL has been promoting ‘Hockey is For Everyone’ and this was a good way to show community support for women and our local hometown university of FAU. The ‘FLA Athlete’ program will showcase the unique abilities and personalities of each FAU female athlete that participates.” Dreamfield will be the background technology and consultant on the “FLA Athlete” program for the Florida Panthers.  Female athletes who sign up to be part of the program will receive a Panthers t-shirt and be invited to attend Panthers hockey games, where they can engage with their own fanbases through social media posts.

"LolaVie founder and creator Jennifer Aniston Believe it or not, Jennifer Aniston has bad hair days—and she always has. “Honestly, my hair has always been a thorn in my side,” she says. “My mom let me do whatever I wanted to do with it. At 13 years old, my hair was long, down to my butt, and I cut it off to a Dorothy Hamill. And I've been paying for that ever since, to get it to grow. As I got older, I started to try to manage the Dorothy Hamill, which turned into a horrible situation. I've always had that issue of not having good hair days. I mean, I have tried everything from egg and mayonnaise in my hair to avocado. You name it, I've tried it. It just felt very natural to for this to be my extracurricular activity.” By “this,” Aniston is referring to the launch of her very own hair line, LolaVie. The plant-based, naturally-derived brand is all about merging science and nature, creating products that are good for your hair that go easy on the environment. The direct-to-consumer, clean line is vegan and cruelty-free, and all formulas are made without silicones, parabens, sulfates, phthalates, gluten and preservatives. LolaVie is launching with the Glossing Detangler, a multitasker that not only detangles hair, but also primes with a vegan thermal shield, boosts shine with lemon extract, smooths with a superfruit complex and vegetable ceramides, and safeguards it from damage with chia seeds. The LolaVie Glossing Detangler can be used solo or spritzed on before heat styling to protect and prime. “I'm a big hair detangler person when I come out of the shower,” Aniston says. “It was figuring out how can we get an all-in-one—a heat protector, give vitamins and nutrients and shine, and help overall bounciness and fullness.” The LolaVie Glossing Detangler Aniston looked to her own hair needs for inspiration for LolaVie. “It was more about my space than white space,” she says. “I wanted to find that product that was a multi. I really got the bug after years of mixing and adding potions and lotions to try to make my hair manageable or appear that it was healthier than it was after years of abuse.” Aniston had worked with a hair brand for years before. “I didn't have really a voice in how to create the product, so when that came to an end this naturally was the next step and it's been the most fun I've had with a side job in addition to what I get to do every day. For five years we've been in development, getting it to this point of perfection and here we are.” LolaVie is Aniston’s debut as a founder and creator, and she’s had her hands in every step along the way, from overseeing product development to marketing to creative direction, making sure that the formulas meet her expectations. “The hardest part was having it work for everybody—everybody's different and has a different routine,” Aniston says. “It was also making sure the ingredients were going to sustain health in your hair and not be short lived, like those that are packed with silicones or sulfates. When we got a new batch of samples, with different ingredients and different combinations of things, we handed [them] out to a group of friends who each have different heads of hair and got the report back from them. It was really interesting. It was a little bit of a puzzle. But I think we got to a place where it's pretty universal.” Jennifer Aniston Though Aniston is mum on the products that are coming out next, they all have one thing in common: The proprietary LolaVie Bond Technology, plus the use of bamboo essence. LolaVie Bond is made from chia seeds and repairs current damage while preventing future damage. Most beauty products are significantly made up of water, which doesn’t offer any perks. Instead, LolaVie is formulated with bamboo essence to deliver plenty of benefits, including a healthier balance between hair and scalp, while saving the planet plenty of water all around—a true win-win. That’s one example of how the brand is full circle when it comes to doing good and being good for you. “How can I feed my hair nutrients and vitamins as I do my body so that it sustains and helps for a long period of time?” Aniston says. In case you’re wondering where the name comes from, LolaVie has personal meaning to Aniston. Many of her friends call her Lola, and to Aniston, Lola symbolizes confidence, fearlessness and empowerment. There’s a bit of that in every bottle, along with what she has learned along the way on her hair journey through trial and error. Despite having one of the most famous haircuts of all time with “The Rachel,” and constantly having her strands copied and scrutinized, she deals with ups and downs like anyone else. “I don't always have perfect hair,” she says. “I kind of have figured out how to have ‘okay, I agree with you’ hair. I also don't try to do anything that's out of my comfort zone. I just stick to a good blow dry and what makes me feel good.” Now, thanks to LolaVie, we can all get a little piece of Aniston’s hair magic.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/celiashatzman/2021/09/08/jennifer-aniston-launches-her-own-hair-line-lolavie-and-talks-bad-hair-days/,"Jennifer Aniston On The Launch Of Her Own Hair Line, LolaVie, And Bad Hair Days"

[+] now, it only works with EVs that comply with the CHAdeMo protocols for vehicle-to-grid integration. Today only the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi Outlander EV are compatible with r16. Imagine tapping into an electric vehicle to generate power in the event that your connection to the local utility is disrupted by a storm. Now envision something that connects your battery-powered car with a roof-mounted solar energy system so you rely on the utility only when its rates are priced at the lowest possible price. That is what Montreal-based Dcbel intends to deliver to 250 homes in the San Francisco Bay Area in the final three months of 2021. The company plans to roll out the system in upstate New York and Texas in the next 18 months.  “The artificial intelligence learns about our way of life inside our home,” said co-founder and CEO Marc Andre Forget. “The AI knows we have dinner at 5 p.m. and that the price of electricity at that hour is more expensive.” So Dcbel’s r16 product can take energy stored in the EV and draw on it to save money during dinner time or other times when the utility’s power is priced at its peak.  “Over the next 20 years our relationship with energy will be redefined,” Forget said.  Vehicle-to-grid, or bidirectional charging, is giving electric vehicles the ability to take in and discharge electricity.  The r16 consists of a solar-power system on the roof and as well as the connection to an EV.  Right now, it only works with EVs that comply with the CHAdeMo protocols for vehicle-to-grid integration. CHAdeMo is an association formed by Tokyo Electric Power Co., Nissan, Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries, which owns Subaru.  After its creation, Toyota, Honda, Hitachi and Panasonic joined the association.  Today only the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi Outlander EV are compatible with r16, according to Forget, but other automakers are adding vehicle-to-grid capabilities to their electric vehicles, including the Kia EV6 and several Volkswagen EVs in development.  Earlier this year Dcbel raised $40 million from a group of investors, including Coatue Management, Real Ventures, WTI and Narrative Fund. Then in August, Silicon Valley Bank put in $7.5 million.  That money will fund a manufacturing plant in Quebec and other plants to be launched in 2022 in the U.S. and Europe.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2021/09/08/montreal-based-dcbel-seeks-to-connect-your-ev-solar-panels-to-the-grid/,Montreal-Based Dcbel Wants To Connect Your Electric Car And Solar Panels To The Grid
"Following a record showing in June, the number of job openings in the U.S. reached another record high in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, signaling demand for workers is still strong even as the economy struggles to add back jobs during the pandemic—a worrisome sign for the labor market's already sluggish recovery. Bartenders wearing protective masks assist customers at Blooms Tavern in New York City. There were 10.9 million open jobs at the end of July compared to a record-setting 10.1 million at the end of June, according to the Labor Department's job openings and labor turnover report released on Wednesday. Job openings were highest in industries including healthcare (up 294,000), finance and insurance (up 116,000) and food services and accomodation (up 115,000). Meanwhile, hires and total separations were little changed month to month about at 6.7 million and 5.8 million, respectively. Roughly 4 million workers, or 2.7%, quit their jobs in July, virtually unchanged from June, while the rate of firings also stayed consistent at about 1%. On Wednesday, Jim Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told the Financial Times the high number of job openings suggests the labor market could post a strong recovery despite its recent slowdown. “The jobs are there, it’s that the workers may not want to take those jobs right now,” Bullard said, adding that ""households are flush with income"" as a result of stimulus checks and historically high savings rates while pointing out the end to pandemic-era unemployment benefits should encourage people to get jobs. “If we can get the workers matched up, it certainly looks like we’ll have a very strong labor market going into next year.” The labor market posted its worst monthly showing since January last month, adding back only 235,000 jobs despite forecasts calling for nearly 1 million additions, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department. “The delta variant of Covid-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement last week, echoing other experts concerned the pandemic’s resurgence has started to curtail the economic recovery. There are still 8.4 million unemployed people in the United States, markedly higher than 4 million in February 2020.  According to Bank of America, an estimated 7.5 million Americans stopped receiving jobless benefits entirely as a result of the federal government's pandemic-era unemployment relief expiring on Monday, while another 3 million people saw their unemployment checks cut by $300 a week—marking the largest cutoff of U.S. unemployment benefits in history.

"CM Punk faces off with Darby Allin in AEW AEW Rampage fell under 700,000 viewers for the first time in its brief history, garnering 696,000 viewers for the live AEW All Out go-home show. The overall viewership was down 3.6% from last week, while Rampage’s .30 rating in the 18-49 demographic was down 11.76%. Bolstered by a WWE Universal Championship main event, Friday Night SmackDown held steady with a total viewership of 2.220 million and a No. 1 ranking in the 18-49 demographic on network TV.  Since CM Punk’s AEW debut garnered 1.129 million viewers for his memorable return to pro wrestling during the August 20 broadcast of AEW Rampage: The First Dance, AEW Rampage’s total viewership has sharply declined by 38%. After drawing a staggering 692,000 18-49 viewers during “The First Dance,” Rampage viewership has fallen a whopping 43% in the coveted 18-49 demo since Punk’s debut.  Perhaps the steep decline suggests many casual fans made it a point to watch Punk’s return to pro wrestling—a huge story seven years in the making that many thought they would never see. Upon seeing Punk’s big return inside the sold-out United Center, however, those fans either never intended to stick around past the historic moment, and/or were simply not convinced to do so.    Though AEW continues to push Rampage as an A-show on the same level of Dynamite, this will continue to be a tall task for the rising promotion. Not only does AEW Rampage face tough sledding in a Friday night timeslot, come 2022 the mostly taped show will move from TNT to TBS. Even CM Punk himself seemed to sense his own honeymoon period beginning to wane. Last week on AEW Dynamite, the top star facetiously asked his hometown crowd: “Are you guys sick of me yet?”  Though the crowd responded with a resounding “No!” the numbers tell a different story as AEW Dynamite’s viewership also declined by double-digits. Last week’s broadcast was down 10.66% from the week prior, which drew AEW’s third-biggest audience in history for Punk’s Dynamite debut on August 25.  Punk, who was advertised to do guest commentary on Rampage, wrestled his first match in seven years at AEW All Out. Thanks largely to CM Punk’s return match, All Out is trending to not only become AEW’s biggest pay-per-view of all time, but also one of the biggest non-WWE pay-per-views since the late ‘90s. But while CM Punk’s return can be qualified as a success to this point, the swift erosion of viewership is a sign that he alone will not be enough to vault AEW to the levels of mainstream pro wrestling it aspires to.  AEW continues to become redundant in stockpiling wrestlers within CM Punk’s wheelhouse. A seemingly indie-obsessed Tony Khan can’t seem to sign enough Caucasian former WWE Superstars who were big names in the indies. AEW catching wind of reports that current WWE Superstar (who was a top star in ROH) Kevin Owens will soon become a free agent is like a feline getting a whiff of catnip. But zeroing in on the prototypical internet wrestling darling comes with a limited appeal, and it may work to alienate casual fans as well as those who tuned out of the product so quickly over the past two weeks.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/08/aew-rampage-viewership-has-fallen-almost-40-since-cm-punk-debut/,AEW 18-49 Rampage Viewership Has Fallen Almost 50% Since CM Punk Debut
"(Left to right) Jon Bernthal, Shea Whigham, Jordana Spiro and John Pollono ponder retribution ... [+] alternatives in 'Small Engine Repair.' Playwright, filmmaker and actor John Pollono doesn’t bristle when it’s suggested that his play-turned-movie Small Engine Repair about three bickering blue collar friends coming together to protect the young girl they’ve raised from infancy draws parallels to Disney’s Sleeping Beauty. “I think it’s kind of cool that that was your interpretation,” the New Hampshire native says. “It may be my favorite one I’ve ever heard. I think it’s amazing that when you get specific and you’re dealing with archetypes and deep emotions, there is that larger-than-life quality.” The dark comedy in which Pollono stars, writes and directs, is based on the acclaimed play he wrote a little more than a decade ago, and premiered in Los Angeles before moving off-Broadway. The film reunites him with the play’s co-star Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead, The Punisher), who reprises his role as Terrance Swaino, alongside new-to-the-role Shea Whigham (Boardwalk Empire, True Detective), who plays Patrick “Packie” Henrahan. The three characters have known each other since they were boys growing up in working class Manchester, N.H. They know each other’s secrets and foibles, and love to bust each other’s chops, especially when trying to flirt with the opposite sex. Frank Romanowski (Pollono) runs an engine repair shop on the edge of town, where he invites his buddies, after a three-month estrangement following a bar fight, to bury the hatchet with a barbecue and whisky. Naturally, the guys show up but soon learn that Frank’s teenage daughter Crystal (Ciera Bravo) is in the hospital after OD’ing on pills. The party amps up and takes a dangerous twist when a frat-boy drug dealer Frank’s invited over rolls up. Secrets are revealed and favors are called in that test the bounds of their friendship. The film also stars Jordana Spiro (Blindspot) as Karen, Frank’s estranged ex, and Spencer House (Space Force) as Chad, the unsuspecting drug dealer. While the film explores modern masculinity, Pollono (This Is Us, Mob City) says women are as likely to glean as much—if not more—from the subject matter as male audiences are. Small Engine Repair, from Vertical Entertainment, opens in theaters Friday Sept. 10.  Angela Dawson: John, you and Jon performed your play about 10 years ago. How was it returning to these roles? John Pollono: There were definitely changes from the play, particularly the inclusion of women. To me, that’s the biggest, most profound change. The women are as crucial and as flawed and as amazing as anybody else. The themes that were present in 2011 have only become more relevant with technology and the #metoo movement.  The play was always this feminist story to me from the point-of-view of these men, tracking into these difficult conversations. Sometimes it’s not a utopic story; sometimes the story is just creating a discussion where there wasn’t one about humiliation, about masculinity, and all this stuff. We felt that now is even more of a time to do that—to create something provocative and challenging. Right now, with all the challenges we have, it seemed more relevant than ever. So, that was all crafted in there. Dawson: Jon, what was it like playing this role again that you originated 10 years ago? Jon Bernthal: What a dream. There’s a palpability and electricity to this piece of theater when we did it 10 years ago in this teeny little theater in L.A. with a 10:30 p.m. show. It was sold out every night; you couldn’t get in. You had all kinds of people coming—the theater community, cops, firefighters, people who’d never been to the theater before. There was this sense in the theater that (the story) was so dangerous, so electric. Anything could happen. It was going to unfold right in front of you, and how scary and alarming that was. It was always buoyed by this sense of authenticity and reality that the humor in the writing brought. So, the question for us was how do we bring this electricity to the screen. If this is going to go down right in front of you, how do we capture that and bring it to the screen. That was really the challenge and that’s what John achieved. As far as coming back to the role, it felt like putting on an old pair of comfortable-fitting jeans but they were so different now. You wore them different. When you bring in a genius like Shea, everything just changes—his approach, his energy, his vitality. There’s so much heart to this thing. It was a difficult process but such a fun process. You always look back and think how this is exactly the kind of movie you want to make. It’s not only something that is so personal but it’s also unbelievably provoking.  Ciara Bravo and John Pollono play daughter and father in 'Small Engine Repair.' Dawson: I kind of saw this as an alternate retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale with Crystal as the Beauty in the hospital and these three men who’ve unconventionally raised her in the absence of her estranged mother since she was a baby as her fairy protectors. They constantly bicker with each other yet are united in their love and commitment to the girl. John, what do you think of that comparison? Pollono: I love that description. We stayed hyper-specific in this. It’s not a movie trying to be a movie. This is a movie we made, I feel, for the smartest person in the room. I have three sisters, and I know they’ll understand the intent of this in a way that a lot of dudes won’t. I grew up surrounded by incredibly strong women so a lot of the archetypes, like Sleeping Beauty, for example, that’s in my DNA.  Dawson: Shea, you’re coming into this the new guy. Tell me about becoming part of this cast. What did you like about playing Packie? Whigham: There was a lot of pressure that I put on myself. The boys didn’t put it on me; I did it. They’d been doing this for years and I was stepping into this role as Packie. Nowadays, we talk about pressure being this bad thing and that no one wants to put that on you. But I think you can use it as a motivator if you know how to use it. I wanted to make these guys proud. I wanted to bring something to (the role) that they hadn’t seen before, maybe. I wanted to make Frank and Swaino feel different and act different. I didn’t want to hear anything about the play. We didn’t discuss the play. It was never like, “Oh we did it like this…” You can’t go into something like this with that kind of pressure. Every once in a while, you do (these films) and they work out better than you anticipated, and this is one of those.  Jon Bernthal said to me, “You will go into this and will not be disappointed with it, I promise you,” and he was right. It’s that good.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adawson/2021/09/08/modern-masculinity-explored-in-john-pollonos-small-engine-repair-screen-adaptation/,Modern Masculinity Explored In John Pollono’s ‘Small Engine Repair’ Screen Adaptation
"(Jurassic Park: The Game image courtesy of Ludia Inc.) Jam City is making its biggest deal to date, acquiring dino-game developer Ludia Inc. from TV production company Fremantle for $165 million, which CEO Chris DeWolfe said will expand the mobile-focused game publisher into new genres even as it prepares for further expansion in the booming game industry.  Jam City co-founder and CEO Chris DeWolfe said the deal, which has closed, help his company expand into augmented- and mixed-reality genres, as well as the hot non-fungible token business of digital collectibles.  “They have some unique technology that got us really excited,” DeWolfe said of Ludia. “We’ve known them for three or four years, and admired their games.”  Acquisition talks went on for about 10 months, in part delayed as Jam City considered going public, before raising money privately to conclude the deal, enable other acquisitions, and invest in further technology for new game experiences.  “We have dry powder for organic investments into new genres and technologies, and more M&A,” DeWolfe said. “We’re definitely leaning in there (on mixed-reality/augmented reality gaming), and also leaning more into the NFT world, which pairs well with gaming. NFTs, we’re going to be making some potential investments there.” Non-fungible tokens are digital collectibles tied to blockchain technology, and have been a red-hot sector the first part of the year in many creative industries from fine art to music to movies and games.   Montreal-based Ludia is one of Canada’s largest mobile game makers, best known for its two current games, both mobile licenses based on Comcast 
  
  CMCSA 
 -owned NBCUniversal’s biggest franchise: augmented-reality title Jurassic World Alive and “build-and-battle” simulation Jurassic World: The Game.  The company is also building games based on Disney 
  
  DIS 
  and DC franchises, and previously has made games built on Hollywood franchises How to Train Your Dragon and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Jurassic World Alive can be roughly summed up as “Pokemon Go with dinosaurs,” using mapping technology and AR functions to sprinkle digital dinos (and more recently, very large birds and mammals) and game resources across the real-world landscape for players to collect. They then can “evolve” and cross-breed their captured creatures for a range of battles against computer and human opponents.  Jurassic World: The Game is more of a simulation, though it too allows players to build up dinosaur collections to battle with others. But the other part of its gameplay involves building out a resort park similar to the titular project portrayed in the movies from Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Studios.  Fremantle, one of the world’s largest TV production companies, first bought a stake in Ludia in 2009, then acquired the whole company in 2014.  Ludia CEO Alex Thabet said in a release, “it was time for Ludia to find the right strategic partner. Jam City is the perfect home to achieve the full growth potential ahead of us.”  DeWolfe said the biggest change for both Ludia titles will be on the back end, as they’re integrated into the Jam City Live monetization and data analytics platform, which the company has been investing in for a decade. “We think that boosts all KPIs,” DeWolfe said. “Other than that, they keep doing what they're best at, building really immersive experiences.”  The acquisition will also allow more cross-promotion between the audiences of the Ludia titles and of Jam City’s existing games such as long-time hits Cookie Jam and Panda Pop, and Hollywood licenses such as Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. The deal adds about 400 Ludia employees to Jam City’s existing 800.  “We're looking for great game studios that have found the fun in the game, magic in the game, and built a loyal following, but haven't made this investment in the (back-end) technology,” DeWolfe said. “We think it can really drive EBITDA.” DeWolfe said he expects few other notable changes with Ludia, in part because Jam City structures its acquisitions to encourage creative teams to stick around for the long haul.  “The companies we acquire we're looking for those founders who want to be partners for a very long time,” DeWolfe said. “We consider the team at Ludia our partners. We’re not the typical, ‘You buy the company, find the synergies and integrate it in.’” The company also plans to do more mergers & acquisitions in coming months, DeWolfe said, using proceeds from a recently concluded $350 million raise of both investment and debt, which the company turned to after cancelling a planned public offering through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition corporation. The SPAC merger had been a “unique vehicle to quickly do the Ludia transaction and go public in the early stages of the SPAC boom, then things just slowed down, and the market got choppy,” DeWolfe said. “The best financial structure for us was raising private money. We didn't want to risk losing the (Ludia) transaction, so we moved forward very quickly. It also provides us with additional capital to create new games, leveraging into new genres and tech that interest us.”  The raise was led by major shareholder Netmarble (Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, Lineage 2: Revolution) and its publishing subsidiary Kabam, as well as “affiliates of funds managed by Fortress Investment Group,” according to a release.  The game sector, at least in the West, has seen record M&A and investment over the first half of the year, topping $25 billion, according to data compiled by the consultancy Digital Development Management. Those figures don’t include Asian companies, particularly in the huge Chinese market. Companies there have seen valuations plummet after the government announced tough new restrictions limiting how much children could play games. DeWolfe said Jam City doesn’t make games that target teen and tween audiences, nor do they have any notable exposure to the Chinese market.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2021/09/08/jam-city-buys-jurassic-game-maker-ludia-for-165-million-readies-for-more-dealmaking-in-ar-nfts/,"Jam City Buys ‘Jurassic’ Game Maker Ludia For $165 Million, Readies For More Dealmaking In AR, NFTs"
"LOS ANGELES, CA - AUGUST 30: Recording artist Kanye West accepts the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard ... [+] Award onstage during the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on August 30, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/MTV1415/FilmMagic) As his new full-length Donda debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the largest opening sales counts of 2021 in the U.S., Kanye West also invades the Hot 100 songs ranking with tunes featured on the project. 23 of the 27 tunes present on the tracklist find their way to the competitive list of the most-consumed individual tracks in America, upping his career total to a historic high. With 23 new hits to his credit, West has now sent a total of 133 songs to the Hot 100. Understandably, that is one of the most impressive sums of all time. By adding nearly two dozen new smashes to his discography at once, the rapper leaps over two collaborators and fellow hip-hop stars on the ranking of the artists who have landed the most Hot 100 smashes in history. Now up to 133 wins, West is the musician with the fifth-most Hot 100 hits of all time. Last week, he was down in seventh place, but adding more than 20 new appearances simultaneously turned out to be enough to quickly pass two others. In his ascent on the all-time ranking, West jumps over Nicki Minaj (119) and Future (124), replacing the latter act in fifth place on the all-genre ranking. Included in West’s 133 Hot 100 hits are four No. 1s and 20 top 10s. While none of the songs from Donda reach the peak position on the chart, two of the most popular tunes featured on the set do begin their run on the tally inside the highest tier. “Hurricane” launches at No. 6, while “Jail” opens at No. 10. Drake continues to lead all musicians with the most Hot 100 hits, as he is currently up to 237 smashes, though that figure is going to climb significantly next week. The Canadian rapper’s new album Certified Lover Boy is headed for the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200, and it appears that all 21 songs featured on the project will likely hit the Hot 100 as well, upping his total to more than 250 placements. Coming in behind Drake on the all-time ranking of artists with the most Hot 100 successes is the cast of the TV show Glee, who sent 207 tracks to the chart during their time together. Lil Wayne appears next with 175 placements, and Taylor Swift is in fourth place with 137 charting tunes. Both Wayne and Future will advance again next week, as they are credited on Certified Lover Boy. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/kanye-west-passes-nicki-minaj-and-future-to-score-the-fifth-most-hot-100-hits-of-all-time/,Kanye West Passes Nicki Minaj And Future To Score The Fifth-Most Hot 100 Hits Of All Time
"Shaquille O'Neal at The 2017 NBA Awards in New York City (Photo by: Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx ... [+] 2017 6/26/17) Shaquille O’Neal retired from professional basketball a decade ago, but it’s safe to guess that the four-time NBA champion and Hall of Fame player never really had any intention of retreating from public life.  Instead, he’s stayed firmly in the public eye, not only for his numerous TV commercials—Icy Hot, Epson and Nestle Crunch easily come to mind—but also as a successful businessman, investor and humanitarian.  One of O’Neal’s biggest business ventures includes a large stake in pizza chain Papa John’s, in which the two-time NBA scoring champ owns at least nine stores in the Atlanta area, as well as a very large amount of stock. Among the Laker legend’s other endeavors are doorbell camera maker Ring as well as 24 Hour Fitness, a gym/fitness center chain of which he is said to own 40 locations. Last October, I first spoke to Shaq as he was preparing to speak at the American Express Summit For Success. During that event Shaq joined tennis legend Venus Williams and others, virtually, due to the pandemic, to share experiences and vision as a business owner and entrepreneur.  But Shaq is also known for his endless community service and philanthropy. It was announced today that Shaq has teamed up with cereal maker Kellogg’s 
  
  K 
 in an effort designed to give middle schoolers nationwide much better access to sports. Kellogg’s released a statement today, saying: “Today, Tony the Tiger and Shaq are teaming up to unveil a game-changing Mission Tiger, which will impact more than 60,000 middle schoolers.” VIDEO: Shaq talks with James Corden about his big credit card mishap.  The Mission Tiger program will take place in six cities where O’Neal played professional basketball over 19 seasons, in Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando and Phoenix.  To promote Mission Tiger, Kellogg’s is releasing its first-ever Frosted Flakes with Crispy Cinnamon Basketballs cereal, with proceeds from the new morning treat going to the program’s improvements to the sports facilities and equipment for kids in various locations.  Fans can also participate in Mission Tiger by uploading their receipts to Kellogg Family Rewards. Kellogg is donating $2 per purchase to DonorsChoose with each Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes receipt uploaded. More info is available at MissionTiger.com Of course, celebration of the program and new cereal was not lost on the longtime NBA superstar.  “Seeing my face on a box of Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, my all-time favorite cereal, is a dream come true,” said O’Neal. He adds that “Me and Tony the Tiger came together help more kids by creating this new cereal.” “What’s even better is that we’ll help kids across the country gain better access to sports,” Shaq said. “Sports teach invaluable skills that will impact these kids for the rest of their lives.” Coming to a breakfast near you: Shaq poses with a signed box of his new favorite cereal.  Students at a handful of lucky schools will also get to host Shaq and Tony the Tiger as surprise guests, with the hoops legend lending a hand as a basketball skills coach. When I spoke with Shaq Tuesday, via Zoom, he elaborated. “Where ever they need to be, I’m definitely going to be. There’s still a need for precaution because we still have Covid,” Shaq said. “But I’ll be there to talk with some kids and shake some hands, because that’s what I like to do on a daily basis anyway.” Shaq points out that when he was a child who grew up playing basketball in the 1970s and early ‘80 in San Antonio, Texas, he looked up to his father was a primary role model, but both took great influence on the court from NBA greats Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, of the Los Angeles Lakers, Philadelphia 76ers legend and Julius “Dr. J.” Erving.  “The gateway to my success,” Shaq said, “was Dr. J. and Magic Johnson. I find it amazing that even though I haven’t played in 10 years, kids still know who I am.” Shaq also said he thinks that one of the reasons kids connect so well with him is that kids see a little bit of themselves in players like him and other NBA stars, such as LeBron James and Steph Curry. But he also says there is something more to his ability to connect with people, especially young people.  “You’re always asked in terms of legacy how you want to be remembered. And it’s simple. I want people to say Shaq was a nice guy. And I am a nice guy.” Big men in the NBA are ‘back’  While Johnson and Erving may have been Shaq’s main hoops heroes, the 7-foot-1 former center, who started with the Orlando Magic followed by eight season with the Lakers, acknowledges that his own style of play was every different than Johnson, a point guard and utility player, and Erving, a small forward.  He says though that from early high school onward he evolved from an outside finesse player into one more dominant under the basket. “When I first started (high school basketball) I was Dr. J. and I was Magic. I was like 6’4” or 6’5”, and then after that I was 6’9”.” But Shaq didn’t stay put in either the guard or forward slots.  “When I got even bigger I realized I had to play like a big man, but I had these guard skills. Some big guys didn’t like to play with their back to the basket, but that’s how I started to play.” Dominate inside: O'Neal slam dunks over Dikembe Mutombo (L) of the Philadelphia 76ers during game ... [+] five of the NBA Finals, June 15, 2001 (Photo credit: MARK TERRILL/AFP via Getty Images) When asked about the last two NBA championships and how big men like L.A. Lakers center Anthony Davis and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo are changing the game, Shaq said he thinks the focus of the game has drifted back toward the paint. “The ‘big man’ is back. Maybe they’re not playing ‘big man’ style basketball all the time. Which is fine,” he said. “But you've got a lot of big guys who can pop out and shoot, and still play with their back to the basket, like Giannis and (76ers start) Joel Embiid. So, yes, the big man is back.” One thing that Shaq said made him special—and that is perhaps coming back in style with teams that employ “big men” as a first line of attack—is about drive and one’s ability to dominate.  When I asked Shaq about some of the players who tried to take him off his game, namely Dennis Rodman and Dikembe Mutombo, he hints that his success was all about mindset and attitude. “My thing was always that I knew I’d (aim to) dominate every game. I knew I had a a lot of floppers out there, and sometimes I’d have to ‘go to finesse’.” He adds: “Sometimes I would get fouled a lot and have to go to the line. And, even though I wasn’t a great free throw shooter, me not being scared, I always wanted to be in that moment. I’d get one of two. But then I’d set my mind (back) on dominating, and that’s what I’d do.  ***** Read Frye’s recent interviews with Usain Bolt and Lindsey Vonn.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyfrye/2021/09/08/shaq-teams-up-with-kelloggs-to-get-kids-playing-more-sports/,Shaq Teams Up With Kellogg's To Get Kids Playing More Sports
"The Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland. When the House Armed Services Committee completed its review of President Joe Biden’s $715 billion Pentagon budget proposal in a late-night earmark marathon, the Committee boosted the overall Defense Department topline budget by about $25 billion.  But not all the proposed new money would be headed to the Department of Defense.  One surprising beneficiary is the Coast Guard, which, if all the House amendments survive, stands to get about $550 million in additional funding. This includes $175 million to improve an often-overlooked public shipyard, the “Coast Guard Yard,” which is perched on the border of Baltimore, in Maryland’s 2nd Congressional District.  For the Coast Guard Yard, the new funding proposal provides for “improvements to dock, dry dock, capital equipment improvements, or dredging necessary to facilitate access.” In other words, the money enables the Department of Homeland Security to start maintaining the Coast Guard’s 11 big and complex National Security Cutters, an incoming set of 25 new Offshore Patrol Cutters, and other military craft “in house.” The Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Karl L. Schultz, welcomed the proposed legislation, saying, “The Coast Guard Yard has provided our Service and our Nation with over 120 years of organic shipbuilding and complex depot-level ship repair. Strategic investments today at the Coast Guard Yard will help ensure that tomorrow’s Coast Guard fleet is properly supported to meet our national priorities, as well as provide additional opportunities for U.S. Navy ship repair work.” The shipyard-oriented amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, sponsored by Virginia Democrat Elaine Luria (VA-2), Vice Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, is unusually savvy in aligning Democrats in the House and the wider Democratic base with an emergent national security challenge.  Luria’s funding initiative, billed as an effort to help confront China, was ideally timed, emerging just as news broke that the National Security Cutter USCGC Munro (WMSL 755) had joined the U.S. Navy in transiting the Taiwan Strait. Strategically, the proposal makes military sense; the Coast Guard’s large National Security Cutters are spending more and more time supporting the U.S. Navy, while the Coast Guard’s smaller patrol ships, the 353-ton Fast Response Cutters, are supporting Pentagon priorities throughout the Pacific and the Middle East.  Representative Luria justified the proposal, telling me, “The Coast Guard must be an important part of any strategy to increase our presence in the Pacific. Investing in our shipyards will help keep our Cutters in service and improve the readiness of our fleet.” While Luria’s efforts to raise the Pentagon’s topline may attract the ire of more progressive members in the House Democratic caucus, Luria was firmly targeted on supporting organized labor, workers who form the bedrock of the Democratic base. Aside from the Coast Guard Yard, all of Luria’s key priorities, a $28 billion boost to naval shipbuilding and $10 billion for military construction, underwrite an enormous amount of work for unionized labor, both in and outside her shipyard-heavy district on the Virginia coast.  In response to the news that more funding might be on the way, Walter Brooks, President of the Baltimore Area Metal Trades Council, a union representing workers at the Coast Guard Yard, said, this is “a great opportunity to keep our workforce working for many decades and future generations of Coast Guard Yard employees.”  If authorized, the new funds offer the Coast Guard an opportunity to keep building on the Coast Guard Yard’s solid record in conducting complex recurring maintenance projects. With the Yard’s demonstrated ability to reduce the cost and time required for each refit, the thrifty facility will now have an opportunity to help drive down the operations and maintenance costs for some of the Coast Guard’s largest cutters, while providing the Coast Guard additional resources to handle emergent or emergency repairs on a range of military vessels.  Specifically, the $175 million windfall will help the Coast Guard Yard deepen the shallow Curtis Bay channel, allowing larger ships and vessels to reach the yard. At the shipyard, the new funding allows expansion and refit of old, World War II-era piers, bringing proposed mooring spots for the Coast Guard’s larger ships towards compliance with modern, hurricane-ready standards. The financial support would also allow the purchase of a floating dry dock potentially able to accept Freedom Class Littoral Combat ship other craft up to roughly the size of a Virginia Class submarine. In total, the new funding helps the Coast Guard avoid costly competition with the U.S. Navy for scarce dry dock spaces at private shipyards, while also allowing the Coast Guard to obtain “ground truth” about refit costs.  The yard is ready to act. Sources say that the Coast Guard is ready to implement and would be able to “get going” after the funding arrived, filling urgent needs for long-lead procurement and contractual work. Time is short, and new cutter maintenance requirements will demand additional Yard support by 2030.  This new funding supplements ongoing improvements at the cost-effective Department of Homeland Security-owned shipyard as the old shipyard slowly optimizes an ancient, outdated layout and recapitalizes decades-old infrastructure. Currently, the yard is busy extending a critical shiplift, allowing the yard to service more ships at a time. A new Fast Response Cutter repair facility is underway, adding docking tent structures that, on top of saving more than $100,000 dollars a refit, offers a more comfortable and ecologically-friendly working environment.  While the House’s Coast Guard funding effort was impressive, Luria’s work at the House Armed Services Committee has a long way to go before becoming law. The entire U.S. House must approve the increases, and then both the Senate and the House need to negotiate out their differences. It’s a tough road, but, given the bipartisan interest in the Coast Guard and a growing recognition that this oft-underfunded sea service is a good steward of taxpayer money and offers an excellent return on taxpayer investments, Luria’s amendment may well advance.  Luria’s efforts have already won bipartisan praise in the Senate. Mississippi’s senior senator, Roger Wicker, a staunch Republican and a strong proponent for Coast Guard Yard funding, said: ""I am glad the House is addressing a portion of the Coast Guard's unmet needs. The Yard is one of many unfunded Coast Guard priorities. I expect and hope that Congress will do more to ensure the Coast Guard is sufficiently resourced."" The bipartisan comity the Coast Guard elicits is, in these fractious times, ample evidence that the Coast Guard is doing all the right things for the nation. It may also suggest that even though Congress is showering money on a chronically-struggling Navy, it is increasingly uncomfortable in asking the high-performing Coast Guard to, once again, do more with less.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2021/09/08/in-a-surprise-house-armed-services-committee-advances-funding-for-coast-guard-shipyard/,"In A Surprise, House Armed Services Committee Advances Funding For Coast Guard Shipyard"
"Angela Yee talks about working on Ciroc's latest campaign #CirocStands For Black Business and her ... [+] podcast Angela Yee's Lip Service (Photo by Johnny Nunez/Getty Images for Remy Martin) Multi-media star and businesswoman Angela Yee is focused on building a legacy. The Wesleyan University graduate first entered in the entertainment industry as an intern at Wu-Tang management and soon became the assistant to the CEO of Wu-Tang Corporation. From there, she worked at Shady Limited, helping to launch Eminem's clothing line and began her career in radio as host of Lip Service and The Morning After with Angela Yee on Shade 45, on Sirius Satellite Radio. In 2010, she became a co-hosts of the nationally syndicated morning radio show, The Breakfast Club, on NYC’s highly rated Power 105.1, along with DJ Envy and Charlamagne the God. She can be heard from 6-10, Monday-Friday in over 100 markets across the country. Without question, Angela Yee is one of the premiere voices of the Hip Hop culture. I caught up with Angela and we spoke about her work on Ciroc’s latest campaign #CIROCStands for Black Businesses, entrepreneurship for Black women, and her podcast, Angela Yee’s Lip Service.  Grove: Can we begin be telling me why business ownership is something your so passionate about? Yee: Well, I think that I always want to make sure I'm planning ahead for the future and establishing a legacy. I think about what I want people to remember me by and I also think about my community. A lot of the businesses that we start directly benefit our community so that’s one of the reasons why entrepreneurship is so important for me. The first business I started was a juice bar because I didn't see that in my community. I know health and nutrition are really important for us and I live in Bed Stuy. I saw a need for something and I started the business. So I think for Black women, when we see a lot of the businesses that they're starting, a lot of them are filling a void of something that they feel is missing. For other Black women who are entrepreneurs, I feel like it's important because we're starting businesses at a higher rate than any other group of people but we're getting the least amount of funding. So in order for us to be able to support ourselves and to support our community, we have to be the ones and Black women are always stepping up to the plate and making it happen. Grove: You already work with Sean “Diddy” Combs on Revolt TV where The Breakfast Club Morning Show airs daily but tell me how you became apart of #CIROCStands? Yee: Actually, I was a part of the #CIROCStands initiative last year which was about encouraging people to get out and vote and that was exciting for me. They had us on billboards and I'm from New York, so being billboard in New York is major. I understand how exciting it is when you are trying to brand yourself and your business and to be given an opportunity to be on a billboard where people will see it. I love the fact that the Ciroc is also a representation of Black excellence and Black ownership and I feel like they’ve always done things that are benefit the community. So when I had the opportunity to work with them on the #CIROCStands, it was something that's really near and dear to my heart. As soon as we had the conversation, they told me, “ Listen, you were the first person I had in mind for the campaign.”  Even before any further discussion, I was like, “Whatever we have to work out, we’ll work out but I absolutely want to do it.” I get to host and visit three Black women who own their own businesses in Harlem and Brooklyn along with photographer/videographer Steven John Irby. I’m glad I get to spotlight these women and they get to share their stories. I know how hard it is to be a Black woman and how hard it is to start a business. I know how it can be really lonely too and there can be so many ups and downs. I know how mentally draining it can be. So if there's anything I can do, you know, to be able to be there and be present and help amplify these women, I wanted to be a part of that. It’s really important to me. It was just  a no-brainer and I think that Ciroc has such a commitment to the community and is a great, great partner. Grove: As a fan of Angela Yee’s Lip Service, tell me how you developed the concept of the podcast and why you think it resonates with so many people?  Yee: My podcast started off as a show when I was on Sirius radio. After I started working at iHeart for a few years, everybody missed it so much so I brought it back as a podcast. That was my first business. I just wasn't looking at it that way at the time but it was my first real business. It was something that I created on my own and it's been great. It's been really powerful for women to have a place where they can go, talk about relationships, talk about sex, speak freely, and not be judged. You know, a lot of times people judge us about our discussions, about what we do with our bodies ,and this is a space for us to be able to really express ourselves and actually have a good time. Grove: You have some much going with The Breakfast Club, Lip Service, you’re a real estate mogul, and your juice bar. I heard that you entered the coffee game. Can you tell me about that? Yee: I'm really excited that my coffee shop is opening this month. My brand is called “Coffee Uplifts People.” Actually, Ciroc helped me with gift boxes and with the grand opening to support my business. It’s something that I feel is a next-level for me because we're actually starting this with the goal of opening more and then turning it into a franchise. This is a completely new challenge and I'm excited about it. We’re actually in Whole Foods right now in the New York City area and Rouses in the Louisiana area. We’re in multiple stores. It’s not like the juice bar where we have a brick and mortar place where you come, get your juice, and go. Coffee Uplifts People is available to be ordered online, shipped, and delivered and also in supermarkets. With the coffee, we're going to expand and I'm breaking the franchise model.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashadgrove/2021/09/08/how-angela-yee-is-building-a-legacy/,How Angela Yee Is Building A Legacy
"California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks at a rally against the upcoming gubernatorial recall ... [+] election, September 4, 2021 at Culver City High School in Culver City, California. - The recall election, which will be held on September 14, 2021, asks voters to respond two questions: whether Newsom, a Democratic, should be recalled from the office of governor, and who should succeed Newsom if he is recalled. Forty-six candidates, including nine Democrats and 24 Republicans, are looking to take Newsom's place as the governmental leader of California. (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP) (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images) In an interview Tuesday evening on conservative cable news network Newsmax, former President Donald Trump said without any evidence that the California recall election targeting Governor Gavin Newsom is “probably rigged.”  In a live phone-in interview on Newsmax’s Rob Schmitt Tonight, Trump told Rob Schmitt that “the ballots are mail-out, mail-in ballots...I guess you can have a case where you can make your own ballot. When that happens, nobody’s going to win except these Democrats...the one thing they’re good at is rigging elections, so I predict it’s a rigged election, let’s see how it turns out.” IRVINE, CA - JULY 31: Pro-recall supporters listen to Carl DeMaio of Reform California as they ...

The suggestion that Newsom would prevail in the recall—but only because of election fraud—was also repeated Tuesday on Fox News Channel, first by Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, who said on Outnumbered that “the only thing that will save” Newsom will be election fraud.  “Yes, Gavin Newsom has raised a whole lot of money from teachers’ unions and special interests and tech, but that money is not going to save him,” Lahren said. “The only thing that will save Gavin Newsom is voter fraud. So as they say, stay woke, pay attention to the voter fraud going on in California, because it’s going to have big consequences for that state but for upcoming elections.” Norwalk, CA - July 13:Larry Elder visits with supporters after entering the race for California ...

"Camera and lidar views from the InnovizOne sensor. Israeli lidar startup Innoviz is the smallest of the half-dozen laser sensor companies that have gone public this year, at least as measured by market capitalization. But it boasts an accomplishment that most of its competitors lack - a design win for a production vehicle, specifically the upcoming BMW iNext series. Lidar startups like Innoviz find themselves in a curious position as publicly-traded companies with little in the way of revenue or other objective metrics, because virtually no production vehicles currently incorporate lidar. Innoviz Vice President of North America Aditya Srinivasan shares that, for the moment, startups like his differentiate themselves in terms of design wins. Those design wins have proven scarce. So far, only two have been announced publicly - Innoviz’s partnership with BMW, and competitor Luminar’s inclusion in future Volvo vehicles. A design win brings a small company like Innoviz into relationships with much larger automotive suppliers. Even though these relationships start small, they can grow to pay dividends in the future. Innoviz has only 350 employees, mostly based in Israel. The BMW partnership connects this small Israeli startup with the giant automotive supplier Magna, which has over 159,000 employees, as well as Aptiv 
  
  APTV 
 , HARMAN, and Renesas, each of which owns a specific responsibility for the BMW iNext driver assistance system. The number of companies involved in this particular effort also hints at the general importance of volume manufacturing and the low costs that facilitates. “The dream of the entire industry is a $500 lidar,” Srinivasan explains. “And when we achieve a $500 unit, at scale, the dream will become a $200 lidar.” A car in the luxury iNext series can incorporate more expensive, cutting-edge sensors than most consumer vehicles. But even the BMW iX xDrive50, which is the first car in the series and which does not yet offer a lidar-equipped option, has a limit on the price it could charge for driver assistance. The base model, currently without a lidar, starts at $83,200. By the time mid-market and entry-level vehicles incorporate lidar, the entire driver assistance package will need to be priced near $1000, with the lidar constituting no more than 20% of that cost, predicts Innoviz’s Srinivasan. Those constraints affect the choices different lidar manufacturers make. While some suppliers utilize more expensive and higher-performance 1550 nanometer laser technology, Innoviz utilizes 905 nanometer lasers, which are more economical, but limited to lower power and range. Innoviz utilizes software to compensate for these constraints by averaging together adjacent signals in its units’ laser arrays, a technique it calls summation. For similar reasons of cost, the iNext system will include only a single front-facing lidar sensor. This may bu sufficient for the partial autonomy that BMW promises for the iNext, but higher levels of autonomy would require more robust sensor suites.  Autonomous vehicles that can operate without a driver, like those built by Alphabet’s Waymo subsidiary, incorporate multiple lidar sensors, covering all sides of the vehicle. But those higher-cost vehicles are designed for ridesharing, rather than sale to individual consumers at a traditional automotive price levels. Innoviz finds itself at the cutting edge of an industry demanding higher performance for lower cost, with only a few firm purchase commitments across the entire ecosystem. As driver assistance becomes prevalent in the coming years, automotive manufacturers are almost certain to purchase lidar units, which is why so many such startups, including Innoviz, have earned support from the public financial markets. The InnovizTwo next-generation lidar sensor unit.  “Innoviz is focused on bringing the next-generation InnovizTwo sensor to market, in volume, at the magic $500 level,” shares Srinivasan, the company’s vice president. Until that volume arrives, Innoviz’s recent IPO provides cash to deliver future generations of products with ever-higher performance for autonomous driving, while satisfying automotive manufacturers and ultimately consumers on price.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsilver/2021/09/08/as-a-public-company-design-wins-are-the-goal-for-innoviz/,"As A Public Company, Design Wins Are The Goal For Innoviz"
"Exposure to pollution from wildfires is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the world each year, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health Wednesday, which the researchers say should highlight the need for rapid action to mitigate climate change and manage vegetation.  Wildfire pollution is linked to tens of thousands of deaths a year.  Fine particulate matter, a form of wildfire pollution, is responsible for some 335,000 deaths every year, according to a peer-reviewed analysis of tens of millions of deaths in 749 cities around the world between 2000 and 2016.  This includes nearly 7,000 deaths from heart-related issues and 3,500 from breathing problems, the global team of researchers found in what is the first global study into the impact of wildfire-related pollution.   Of the many pollutants emitted by wildfires, the researchers said fine particulate matter is the most concerning as it is able to enter the bloodstream through the lungs and its chemical makeup usually makes it more toxic than that from other fires. According to the data, Japan has the most deaths related to wildfire pollution, with over 7,000 each year in 47 cities.  The U.S., with nearly 3,200 annually in 210 cities, also ranked as one of the countries with the most deaths related to wildfire smoke, the researchers found, alongside Mexico (more than 3,000 in 10 cities), South Africa (around 5,300 in 52 cities) and China (around 1,200 in 15 cities). The researchers cautioned that the study had not been able to capture the full extent of wildfire pollution during the study period, did not consider other wildfire pollutants like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and did not factor in the other health consequences of such pollution like injury or worsened mental health.  Yuming Guo, the study’s lead researcher, told Forbes the frequency and effects of wildfires and their smoke will increase as a result of climate change. This goes beyond cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, Guo said, noting that “air pollution affects all body functions” and has been linked to issues involving mental health and suicide, diabetes, the kidneys and the brain. In the U.S., it’s not just areas where wildfires rage that need to worry about the effects of air pollution. “Wildfire smoke can be spread to other areas of the U.S. and other countries,” Guo told Forbes, suggesting people to “take actions to protect their health.”  Wildfires have torched vast swathes of the U.S. and Europe amid tinder dry weather this year. While they are a natural and important part of some ecosystems, the scale and severity of the wildfires burning is extreme and many regions, including parts of the U.S., have endured record breaking seasons in recent years. Experts believe these will only get worse as human-driven climate change increases the likelihood of the dry and hot conditions favorable to wildfires. This fits into a pattern of human-driven climate change that is making dangerous extreme weather conditions more likely. The Lancet study adds to growing research that suggests toxins in the air can have profound effects on our minds and bodies. Higher and more severe instances of suicide, depression and schizophrenia have been linked to air pollution. Long term exposure has been linked with reduced cognitive intelligence, especially among men.

"More than 150 years after his surrender effectively ended the American Civil War and paved the way for slavery to be abolished in the U.S., a larger-than-life statue of Confederate general Robert E.

[+] statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee on Monument Avenue, Wednesday, Sept. 8, 2021, in Richmond, Va. Shortly before 9 a.m., a large crane hoisted the statue of Lee seated on a horse and slowly lowered it from its pedestal about 40 feet below. As the statue descended, crowds celebrated, cheering and chanting “Whose streets? Our streets!” and “na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye.” Surrounding streets were shut down Tuesday as protective fencing was set up around the monument’s perimeter in preparation for the statue to be torn down. Armed guards patrolled the area and late Tuesday night asked people on the scene to leave the monument site. The Federal Aviation Administration, citing security concerns, temporarily banned drones within a roughly two-miles radius of the statue that went into effect Tuesday morning and will expire just before midnight on Thursday. Lee’s statue and other Confederate monuments littered across the U.S. came under intense scrutiny last year amid nationwide protests against racism after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by police in Minneapolis. Nearly 100 Confederate monuments were torn down last year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Critics say the monuments celebrate white supremacy, and point out that many of the Confederate statues standing today were constructed in waves during the early 20th century, first when Jim Crow laws were introduced to disenfranchise Black Americans, and again in the 1950’s and 1960’s amid the civil rights movement. Virginia officials announced this week the statue of Lee would be torn down Wednesday after the state supreme court unanimously ruled that Virginia had the authority to remove the statue more than a year after Gov. Ralph Northam (D) ordered it taken down. Northam’s move was challenged in court by two lawsuits that argued the governor didn’t have the right to pull down the state-owned statue based on 19th-century state law and a property deed. The 21-foot-tall bronze statue of Lee has presided over Richmond’s Monument Park since it was erected in 1890, about 25 years after Lee surrendered after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, which was fought 76 miles east of west of Richmond.   Virginia Will Take Down Massive Statue Of Robert E.

  shareholders will vote on a proposal requesting disclosure around the company’s work to promote diversity and inclusion, a move that’s seen as long overdue. They will decide whether or not the company needs to release data on pay and hiring by race and gender. Currently, the sports footwear and apparel giant does not release its EEO1 form, which is the best practice for sharing workforce composition. This is in stark contrast to 71% of S&P 100 companies, as Nike continues to reckon with systemic internal racial inequity, while attempting to shape a better society. The Breakdown You Need to Know: The company has around 75,400 employees and  earned $44.5 billion in the fiscal year ending May 31, up 19% from the previous year. Studies have pointed to the corporate benefits of a diverse workforce, including companies with the strongest racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns above industry median. Additionally, a Wall Street Journal study of the S&P 500 found that the most diverse companies had an average annual five year stock return 5.8% higher than the least-diverse companies. CultureBanx noted that perhaps this is why investors are seeking quantitative, comparable data to understand the effectiveness of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the organization. In August, the SEC rejected the company’s request to skip the vote because it excluded a proposal filed on behalf of As You Sow, an activist group, intended to address annual reporting assessing Nike’s diversity and inclusion efforts. Specifically, including goals, metrics and trends related to the promotion, recruitment and retention of protected classes of employees. For Nike, it argued in its request for no-action relief that its existing public disclosures already discuss the process for assessing its DE&I program related to workforce diversity. Clearly, the SEC did not agree Sprinting Past Allegations: Nike has faced damaging allegations of harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and gender identity. However, the company’s most recent impact report seeks to address some of these concerns by including DEI targets that the Company will seek to achieve by 2025. Some of those targets include; having U.S. racial and ethnical minorities make up 30% of the Company’s employees at the director level and above, increasing the Company’s pipeline of Black and Latinx talent at the director level and above; and  having U.S racial and ethnic minorities make up 35% of the U.S. corporate workforce. Earlier this year, Nike laid out a five-year roadmap to creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce. One of the major changes was that the company tied its executive compensation to the company making progress in deepening diversity and inclusion throughout its workforce. We have still yet to see exactly how this will shake out. Nike is also investing $10 million in HBCUs and Hispanic serving institutions through scholarships and academic partnerships to build out a pipeline to increase the number of Black and Latinx interns who can transition into direct hires. What’s Next: By 2025, Nike is pledging to maintain 100% pay equity across all employee levels, on an annualized basis. The company’s shareholders will vote on the resolution to release racial and ethnic demographic data on Oct. 6.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2021/09/08/nike-shareholders-race-towards-diversity-data/,Nike Shareholders Race Towards Diversity Data
"Mac Jones and the New England Patriots will open the 2021 NFL season against the Miami Dolphins on ... [+] Sunday.  Week 1 of the 2021 NFL season is finally upon us. It all begins on Thursday night with the defending champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers hosting the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL Kickoff Game. It’s shaping up to be a fantastic opener to what should be nothing short of an exciting season. There have been some changes made for the 2021 season, the most notable being the addition of a 17th regular season game onto the schedule. This—coupled with the expanded 14-team playoff field that was introduced last year and returning for the 2022 NFL playoffs—sets up an extended campaign for fans to enjoy. Sports bettors should also be thrilled about the lengthened season. The additional contests to wager on are a welcome sight, especially after a long offseason devoid of any meaningful action since the Super Bowl.   If you are one of the countless football fans who bet games against the spread, partake in survivor contests or participate in any other sort of picks pool, it’s time to start making your predictions for Week 1. Beginning the year on a high note will go a long way towards having a successful 2021 NFL betting season.  Week 1 is the ideal time to capitalize on extremely soft lines and incredible value presented by sportsbooks. Many of the odds up on the board are heavily influenced by last year’s performances, with some guesswork done to account for how an offseason full of personnel changes may have shifted the league’s hierarchy. The public and bookmakers alike don’t have much information to go on yet, however, and won’t until Week 1 reveals some much-needed intel on how each club might fare in 2021.  Bettors looking to capitalize on this lack of info have come to the right place. Below you can find a handful of picks against the spread that will help you come out ahead on your season-opening wagers. Before getting to the best bets for the upcoming slate, look at the complete schedule, start times, TV channels, live stream sites, updated odds courtesy of FanDuel and more for each Week 1 game to start the 2021 NFL season.

New England Patriots vs. Miami Dolphins Tua Tagovailoa will begin the 2021 season as the Miami Dolphins starting quarterback.  Two of the league’s most intriguing young quarterbacks will take center stage when New England’s Mac Jones and Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa square off in Week 1.  Jones surprisingly earned the starting job as a rookie following the release of incumbent signal-caller Cam Newton. The No. 15 overall pick was mocked by experts as high as No. 3 leading up to the draft, but fell during the event until New England stopped his fall. The Alabama product landed in an ideal situation, joining a hungry and veteran-laden squad that just saw its NFL-record 11-year streak of postseason appearances come to an end.  With New England sparing no expense in free agency, the Pats are poised to improve on a middling 7-9 SU and ATS record from last year. The team added several weapons to support Jones, including tight ends Hunter Henry and Jonnu Smith and receiver Nelson Agholor.  The Dolphins made a surprise playoff push in Year 1 of the Tua era last season. The team narrowly missed out on making the 14-team field after finishing 10-6 SU. Miami made some notable offseason acquisitions to help Tagovailoa going forward, expending the No. 6 overall pick to acquire elite wideout prospect Jaylen Waddle and coming to terms with a talented veteran receiver in Will Fuller V.  Although fans in South Beach may have been disappointed in how last year ended, bettors certainly were not. The ‘Phins were the most profitable team in the league last year, covering at a 68.8% clip (11-5 ATS). In comparison, blindly betting New England would have been a losing endeavor with the Pats covering at 43.8% rate (7-9 ATS) in 2020. When they met on the field last year, the Pats and Dolphins continued their trend of trading blows. Each team has won and covered three times over the last six showdowns, including splitting their 2020 matchups right down the middle.  The Pats won and beat the 7.5-point spread at home last year, an unsurprising result given how well this team has fared in its own digs against the Dolphins. New England has now covered in eight of the last nine matchups against Miami at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots have a chance to continue that streak as three-point home chalk in Week 1.  This one could end up being another low-scoring affair, as games tend to go under when the Dolphins and Patriots share the field. Five of the last seven matchups, including both last season, landed below the total.  Some bettors might be scared off New England due to the presence of a rookie quarterback, but a young signal-caller can find success in this league. Since 2004, the 46 rookie QBs who have started at least seven games have combined for a slightly profitable 307-284-15 ATS record.  First-year quarterbacks do even better out of the gate. Since 2013, rookie starters have gone 27-14 ATS between Weeks 1-3. With a potent offensive line—one that PFF has ranked No. 3 in the league going into 2021—and an armada of talent around him, Jones is poised to start his career with a victory. The Patriots simply have better players and the advantage of playing at home on their side.  Don’t discount the amount of time this squad has had to get ready for Week 1 either, as head coach Bill Belichick has historically capitalized on situations that afford extra preparation. His teams have gone 4-1 ATS in season openers over the last five years and are 15-5 following a bye since 2001.  On paper, New England clearly has an advantage going into the opener against Miami. The team is only a slight, three-point favorite, however, due to the question mark that is Mac Jones making his professional debut. Considering how well the 23-year-old looked in training camp and preseason, bettors can rest assured that Jones will be able to competently lead this squad to victory. Lay the points and go with the Pats here. This is a golden opportunity to capitalize on a soft line and a rare chance to back a much-improved New England team before the rest of the betting world realizes how good they will be in 2021.

"Skateboarder Sky Brown has a new partnership with CLIF Kids called Sky's the Limit in which she and ... [+] CLIF encourage kids going back to school to celebrate their victories and unique talents As one of the youngest skateboarders to compete in the Tokyo Olympics, Sky Brown, 13, has amassed a worldwide contingent of devoted fans—most of them her peers. And it’s no wonder; the Olympic bronze medalist is known for her bubbly personality, infectious smile and intense drive to be the best women’s park skater in the world. Now, Brown is teaming up with CLIF Kid to lend support to kids going back to school in the midst of the pandemic after a challenging year, as well as give them opportunities to celebrate their unique talents.  The “Sky’s the Limit” campaign features a custom badge with Brown’s personal motto, “Sky is the Limit,” printed on stickers kids can put on their water bottles or notebooks. It also encourages kids (or their parents) to show off their talents on Instagram, using a digital AR filter of Brown’s helmet that can be floated on a photo or video and three GIFs from the @CLIFKid handle. Skateboarder Sky Brown has a new partnership with CLIF Kids called Sky's the Limit in which she and ... [+] CLIF encourage kids going back to school to celebrate their victories and unique talents “Our goal is to bring a little joy to the back-to-school season and fuel kids’ imaginations,” said Valerie Van Arkel, CLIF Kid brand manager. “In a recent survey, nearly all parents said they believe their kids could use additional support this school year. Now kids can head back to school with the confidence that comes with knowing people are in your corner.”  Brown also becomes the first athlete to be featured on the packaging for CLIF Kid’s popular Zbar snack bar. CLIF Bars have already featured athletes in limited-edition packaging, including fellow skateboarder Jordyn Barratt. Brown is shown demonstrating her signature frontside air trick on the package of the Iced Oatmeal Cookie Zbar, one of CLIF Kid’s top-selling Zbar flavors and one of Sky’s personal favorites. “It’s insane,” Brown says of being featured on the packaging. “CLIF is honestly the best. There are so many snacks that if they’re healthy, they don’t taste good, if they’re unhealthy, they taste good. But when I go surf or go on a hike, CLIF bars are so perfect. It tastes good and gives me energy.” With a nutritionist mom and a demanding career, Brown is hyperconscious of what she chooses to fuel her body. “My mom puts lots of vegetables in my food,” Brown, whose favorite meals include sushi, ramen, and Italian food, said. “She makes really good food and she’s really healthy; she changes it up every day, I don’t have an everyday meal, she makes different stuff every day she thinks is healthy.”  The CLIF Kid Zbar is smaller than a CLIF Bar, at 1.27 ounces compared to 2.4, and contains fewer calories (130-150 compared to 240-260) and more whole grains. As part of the partnership, kids can enter to win a a limited number of “sponsorship packs” containing Brown’s signature CLIF products. Each Wednesday throughout September beginning today at 9 a.m. EST, a limited number of packs will available on a special product landing page, CLIFKidSkyIsTheLimit.com.  The sponsorship pack includes two sticker designs, one with the typographical “Sky is the Limit” motto and the second of Brown demonstrating her frontside air, as well as a box of the Iced Oatmeal Cookie flavor Zbar featuring Brown’s limited-edition packaging.  A Sky Brown Sky is the Limit sticker available in CLIF Kid's ""sponsorship packs"" as part of the ... [+] company's partnership with Brown Though she’s asked about it all the time, Brown doesn’t find it difficult balancing being a professional athlete with being a teenager. She goes to charter school three days a week and does the rest of her schooling online to accommodate her travel schedule.  Because she spends so much of her free time at the skatepark—“Some people think skateboarding is work for me, but it’s really a playground,” she says—she places a high value on school, because it’s where she gets to see her friends. She also skateboards and surfs with her nine-year-old brother, Ocean. For any other kid who might dream about being a professional athlete, Brown has some words of wisdom from her personal experience. (Her perspective is no doubt useful for many adults, as well.) “Anybody can do it,” she said. “Definitely get off your phone, get outside, work out, move...24 hours is pretty long; you have quite a bit of time to get out.” “Getting up early makes you feel like you have lots of time,” added Brown, who is also honing her surfing skills at a competitive level and wakes before dawn to get in the water. “It feels like you fit a lot in a day.” Indeed, between training and qualifying for the Olympics—where, as the daughter of a British father and a Japanese mother, she chose to represent Team Great Britain—and competing in high-level events like Dew Tour and Tony Hawk’s Vert Alert (where, after Hawk, she was one of the athletes who drew the most fans), Brown found time to write and record an original song, “Girl,”—as well as a music video.  It may seem that there’s nothing Brown can’t do, but she believes firmly in the power of tenacity and a positive attitude.  As for kids who may be overwhelmed going back to school amid the pandemic or just need an extra boost of encouragement, the radiant 13-year-old has a message.  “Be brave, be strong, have fun, and do it because you love it,” Brown said. “Don’t let anybody stop you. Get out there, try it, believe in yourself. You can do anything.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2021/09/08/13-year-old-skateboarder-sky-brown-partners-with-clif-kid-to-sponsor-support-kids-going-back-to-school/,"13-Year-Old Skateboarder Sky Brown Partners With CLIF Kid To ‘Sponsor,’ Support Kids Going Back To School"
"The Cruise Origin electric robotaxi is designed for easy maintenance and long-term use, much like aircraft used by major airlines.  Cruise, the autonomous driving company backed by General Motors, is looking beyond the auto and tech industries as it designs a robotic taxi service that will launch in San Francisco, tapping airline industry veterans with expertise in passenger experience and fleet maintenance. The San Francisco-based company in January hired Gil West to be its chief operating officer, following his retirement from Delta Air Lines where he’d also served as COO and senior executive vice president. Cruise also recently added two other airline executives—Anthony Gregory who’d been with Southwest Airlines and former Virgin Atlantic COO Phil Maher—to serve as its vice presidents of market development and central operations. The company’s focus on utilizing airline industry veterans stems from similarities between that industry and the emerging autonomous ride business, West tells Forbes.  Cruise COO Gil West “There’s safety. The aviation model is important here with an approach and processes that were developed over the last 100 years. That overlaps with exactly what we're doing in the autonomous space. Airlines are operationally intensive, and that’s the goal for Cruise, with high-tech vehicles engineered right for a purpose—airplanes and autonomous vehicles,” West said.  “And it’s not just the technology. It’s the ability to last decades. In the airlines’ case that can be 30, even 40 years. For autonomous vehicles we expect them to run a million-plus miles.” Cruise tests autonomous electric Chevrolet Bolts almost exclusively in San Francisco and has been operating vehicles there without a safety driver behind the wheel since December 2020. And though it has received permission from California to pick up passengers in its robotaxis, state rules don’t yet allow it to charge for those rides. The company has announced plans to expand into Dubai by 2023, and though Cruise hasn’t set a date for the start of commercial ride services in the U.S. it may not be that far off.  “It’s months, not years,” West said, without elaborating. Backed by Honda, SoftBank and Walmart along with General Motors, Cruise has nearly 2,000 employees and is among the world’s best-funded autonomous tech companies, having raised about $11 billion. It’s competing with companies including Alphabet’s Waymo, Ford- and Volkswagen-back Argo AI, Amazon’s Zoox and Hyundai Motor-affiliated Motional for large-scale commercialization of on-demand robotaxis over the next few years.  Waymo currently operates the only paid, autonomous ride service in the U.S. (without backup human drivers), hauling passengers around suburban Phoenix in a fleet of hundreds of Pacifica Hybrid minivans from Stellantis. Much like the in-flight safety videos used by airlines, the Alphabet unit begins rides with an explanatory video going over the basics of its robotaxis.  Cruise unveiled the Origin in January 2020, a purpose-built electric van developed by GM and Honda that will be the core model in its fleet when its ride business launches. And like fleets of aircraft operated by airlines, Origin is designed for long-term, flexible use and easy maintenance. The electric vehicles will be built using a relatively low-cost platform and will allow for easy swapping and upgrades of sensors including laser lidar, radar and cameras and easy-to-replace body panels. Vehicle doors are large to allow replacement and upgrades of interior flooring, ceilings and seating and the use of high-durability plastics will allow for easy cleaning.  He declined to say how many of the vehicles Cruise will eventually operate, though the first of 100 pre-production Origin units are being built now and will soon undergo road and durability testing. They’ll eventually be produced at GM’s dedicated electric vehicle “Factory Zero” Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan from 2023.  “Design with both capex and opex in mind is fundamental to the vehicle. Longevity plays a huge role in them and maintainability and reliability are key to the equation too,” West said. “Just like the airlines, we’re fanatics about utilization.”  “The more hours per day you can operate, the more utility you can get out of the vehicles, the fewer vehicles you need and you’re really utilizing the ones you have. We're going to be fanatical on a continuous improvement basis.” ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/09/08/cruise-looks-to-the-skies-as-it-readies-robotaxi-service/,Cruise Looks To The Skies As It Readies Robotaxi Service
"The JBoy Show broadcasts live on weekdays from the College Football Hall of Fame The JBoy Show, an SEC-centric college football podcast hosted by former college football coach Jake “JBoy” Crain, has signed seven football student athletes from around the SEC for weekly segments on the show. The seven student athletes are Bo Nix (Auburn), Connor Bazelak (Missouri), Jordan Battle (Alabama), Jalen Wydermyer (Texas A&M), Todd Harris (LSU), Kearis Jackson (Georgia) and Jamaree Salyer (Georgia). Each player will join The JBoy Show for a 15-20 minute segment once a week to discuss last week’s game and preparations for that week’s game. Thanks to new rules that allow student athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, each student athlete will receive $500 per show for 15 weeks for a total of $7,500 each. ""We're very excited to bring student-athletes from different universities around the SEC to provide prospective to fans they won't be able to get anywhere else,” said Crain. “We want to be able to provide our audience with the human element of playing in the nation's top college football conference from the league's top play-makers."" Student Athlete NIL (SANIL) worked with Icon Source to broker this deal. Jason Belzer, a former Forbes contributor and managing partner of SANIL, says this deal sets a precedent for future deals in the media space. ""Name, image and likeness is all about empowering student-athletes to own their brands and the message they send to their loyal fans. SANIL and IconSource were honored to represent The JBoy Show in putting together the largest and most lucrative multi-athlete / multi-school media deal of the NIL era yet. With student-athletes from six different schools and states, and all with different agents, there was quite a bit of complexity involved; The JBoy Show will now be the new standard for NIL media focused deals."" Bazelak’s agent, Jenna Nobles, director of marketing and sales for Octagon, says the partnership is one that allows her client to engage with fans in a way that fits with the personal brand he’s cultivating. “We’re stoked to have Connor involved as a featured athlete in this unique media deal. From day one, Connor emphasized the importance of being the driver of his own narrative and utilizing NIL to grow his brand, and this partnership with JBoy checks all of those boxes. In the digital age, we’re seeing so many athletes feel empowered to speak and connect directly with fans and it’s our job to put them in positions to do so successfully. For Connor, this partnership is engaging, it’s fun, it’s authentic and we’re excited to watch it unfold this season” It’s not the first instance we’ve seen of a media entity paying student athletes to appear. It’s not even the first in the SEC. Before SEC Media Days in July, TexAgs.com paid Texas A&M football players Isaiah Spiller and safety Demani Richardson $10,000 each for exclusive feature interviews as part of a deal with local company, GreenPrint Real Estate Group. Vince Thompson, whose sports marketing agency MELT helped Crain launch The JBoy Show in March 2020, says he thinks more of these kinds of media opportunities will be available for student athletes. “I think the future is bright and unlimited for these student athletes. Not only does it raise and elevate their profile and brand, it adds value to any existing deals they’ve done. For instance, Auburn QB Bo Nix was on with Jake this week and he was able to mention his sponsor, Milo’s Tea. And if a student athlete aspires to a career in broadcasting, no better format or platform than to audition in real time.” His advice to radio stations and podcasts that might want to venture into the NIL waters? “I would seek out unique characters, or ‘hometown heroes’ as I call them. Local TV, radio stations and podcasters can seek ways to continue these relationships with these student athletes far beyond what they could do in the past. Then tie local revenue back to the student athletes, their families, the local companies and the station. It’s a win-win all around.” Crain lost his college coaching job at Montana last year during the pandemic and has since built up a podcast with more than two million downloads. He recently joined Colin Cowherd’s The Volume podcast network, and he’s now broadcasting the show live daily from the College Football Hall of Fame. You can watch The JBoy Show on weekdays from 3-4 p.m. ET on YouTube or listen to it as a podcast the following day through iTunes or Spotify.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristidosh/2021/09/08/seven-sec-student-athletes-land-paid-segments-on-the-jboy-show/,Seven SEC Student Athletes Land Paid Segments On The JBoy Show
"New Subaru cars sit in half empty storage lot at Auto Warehouse Co. on May 14, 2021 in Richmond, ... [+] California.  If you or anyone you know has been car-shopping recently, offer them your condolences. There are record low numbers of new and used vehicles on the market right now.  That’s because we’re officially in ‘perfect storm’ territory for new and used car buyers. This is thanks to the combination of low interest rates, consumers flush with stimulus and tax refund monies, pent-up demand from 2020’s Covid-19 uncertainty, and a rental car market that is clamoring for new vehicles while not pumping used models into the market.  The sales lot at Marin Honda is nearly empty on July 9, 2021 in San Rafael, California.  But nothing has made the situation worse than the historic chip shortage that’s been hammering the entire new car industry for months (and which is expected to continue into 2022). Roll these problems together and you have some of the thinnest new and used vehicle inventory in recent memory.  The inventory shortage is particularly acute on the new vehicle side of things. According to data released by CarGurus.com (our parent company), the number of new vehicles available in August 2021 dropped 13.4% from July and they’re down 64% from August 2020.  Thanks largely to the chip shortage, those inventory numbers have been trending downward since December 2020 and are nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. (Prices — as you might imagine — are therefore going up. The average new-car price in August 2021 is nearly 18% higher than it was in August 2020.)  But what does that mean for actual car shoppers? How is all this impacting their behavior? To find out, Autolist.com surveyed more than 1,500 car shoppers in August. Here’s what we found: New Ford F-Series pickup trucks are stored in a lot during a semiconductor shortage at Kentucky ... [+] Speedway in Sparta, Kentucky, U.S., on July 16, 2021.  1. You can’t beat truck loyalty. Truck buyers — particularly fullsize truck buyers — are the most loyal car shoppers in the industry. Once an automaker hooks a truck buyer, it’s exceptionally hard to get them to switch to a different brand, let alone a different type of vehicle.  Despite the chip shortage hammering truck production for the key fullsize truck players — General Motors, Ford, and Ram — and forcing plant closures, truck shoppers in Autolist’s survey remained the most loyal out of any vehicle segment in the industry.  Just 24% of truck shoppers in Autolist’s survey said they were looking at a different brand that they would normally consider as a result of the inventory shortages. Truck shoppers in our survey were also among the least likely to consider a different type of vehicle than they originally considered. Just 20% said they would do so, the second-lowest number behind only full-size sedan shoppers.  (At the other end of the loyalty spectrum are shoppers looking for small sedans. 46% of them said they were looking at brands they wouldn’t normally consider as a result of inventory woes.)  2. No one is giving up on safety. Autolist’s survey asked shoppers if and how they were compromising on their next vehicle when they couldn’t find the one they originally were looking for. The least-popular choice? Safety. Just 8% of respondents said they were giving up safety features that they would normally look for in their next vehicle as a result of low inventory at the dealership. That’s reassuring.  3. Brand loyalty is suffering. So what are consumers doing when they can’t find the vehicle they want? Switching brands. That was the most common response when shoppers were asked what they’re changing during their shopping journey (with our aforementioned truck buyers being the obvious exception here). 31% of people said they were switching to a different brand — rather than looking for a larger or smaller vehicle, something in a different body style, or giving up on certain non-safety-related amenities.  The sales lot at Hilltop Ford in Richmond, California is nearly empty on July 9, 2021.  On its face, this seems like an obvious reaction. Of course, a shopper looking for a compact crossover from Brand A, for example, would end up with a compact crossover from Brand B rather than a full-size SUV or a minivan. But it could have long-term implications for automakers going forward. Getting people to switch brands is a huge challenge for automakers, inventory woes or not. It could take a decade or more to get today’s buyers into a different brand of vehicle, a horizon that no automaker will be relishing.  Chevy Camaros sit on a lot at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant on September 2, ... [+] 2021 in Lansing, Michigan. GM has had to temporarily shut down most of its North American plants due to the semiconductor chip shortage. 4. Younger shoppers are more upbeat. You gotta love youthful optimism. Car shoppers on the younger end of Autolist’s survey audience were the most likely to agree that now was still a good time to get a new or used vehicle by a significant margin. 52% of shoppers ages 18-23 felt this way, as did 53% of shoppers ages 24-28.  Each successive age group was less and less likely to agree (just 23% of people ages 66-75 agreed, for example). Across all age groups, an average of just 42% of shoppers felt this way.  The irony here is that younger shoppers in Autolist’s survey also had the smallest budget for their purchase; each successive age group planned on spending more than their younger cohorts.  This matters because it’s the inventories of cheaper new and used vehicles (anything under $20,000) that have been hit the hardest in the past year, by a wide margin.  So despite these younger buyers favoring cheaper vehicles that are in much shorter supply, they’re still feeling good about buying a car right now.   5. More time online and on the road. With thinner inventory on dealer lots across the country, consumers are making two key behavioral changes to their car shopping.  For one, more people are spending more time online to find the exact model they’re looking for before heading to a physical dealership. 51% of respondents in Autolist’s survey said they were doing this, owing to the fact that people were less able to browse the lot in person and find a vehicle that suits their needs. (Also, the jump in online shopping is also likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly concerns about the Delta variant).  Not only are people spending more time online, but they’re also expanding their physical search too. 42% of shoppers said they were looking at dealerships further away than they would normally use as a result of low inventory nearby.  This raises some interesting issues as these consumers own the vehicle they may have purchased further away. Since consumers are also more likely to switch brands as a result of inventory woes, it’s now more likely that they buy a brand that may not have a store and service center nearby, meaning a more tedious ownership experience through the lifespan of that vehicle.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidundercoffler/2021/09/08/five-ways-car-shoppers-are-responding-to-record-low-inventory/,Five Ways Car Shoppers Are Responding To Record Low Inventory
"SOUTH KOREA - NOVEMBER 22: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY; NO BOOK COVERS.) In this image released on November ... [+] 22, Jungkook, Suga, V, Jin, RM, Jimin, and J-Hope of BTS perform onstage for the 2020 American Music Awards on November 22, 2020 in South Korea. (Photo by Big Hit Entertainment/AMA2020/Getty Images via Getty Images) A little more than a week ago, BTS re-released their smash “Butter,” inviting rapper Megan Thee Stallion to hop on board and provide an insanely catchy verse. Her inclusion reinvigorated interest in the tune, which had started to fall down the Hot 100. This frame, “Butter” returns to No. 1 on the Hot 100, earning its tenth stay in the penthouse on the highly competitive ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. “Butter” is able to slide from No. 7 all the way to No. 1 thanks primarily to a massive sales frame, something which the band has become accustomed to. The cut holds as the bestselling song in America once again, and with one more turn atop the sales-only chart, BTS tie one of the greatest and most successful artists of all time in a very special feat. BTS have now led the charge on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales chart for a whopping 40 weeks throughout their years as bestsellers. Reaching that milestone means the South Korean boy group is now tied with Rihanna for the second-most frames spent at No. 1 on the purchase-focused tally. Both Rihanna and BTS are currently only being beaten by Taylor Swift, and they aren’t far behind the country/pop/alternative singer-songwriter. The Grammy winner has now owned the Digital Song Sales chart for 44 weeks, and she may soon be challenged for the throne. This week, “Butter” sold 143,000 copies, which is a large enough sum to make it the bestselling track in the U.S. many times over. In fact, this past sales frame marks the second-largest of 2021, with the same tune’s opening sales sum of more than 242,000 copies winning by a mile.  BTS have now racked up eight No. 1 hits on the Digital Song Sales chart, and amazingly, “Butter” isn’t even their newest champion, even though it currently runs the show. The seven-member band has ruled over the tally with the following smashes: “Dynamite,” “Butter,” “Life Goes On,” “On,” “Fake Love,” “Film Out,” “Idol” with Nicki Minaj and just a few weeks ago, “Permission to Dance.” “Butter” is sure to begin slipping back down the Hot 100 next week as songs from Drake’s new album Certified Lover Boy debut and take over the chart, but BTS may be able to hold on to their control of the Digital Song Sales chart. Even if the group doesn’t appear at No. 1 next time around, they stand a good chance of bouncing back to the summit with their current leader very soon, as they have shown many times before that when they hit the top, they usually hold there for a while. If (more like when) BTS does earn another turn atop the purchase-only list, they will pass Rihanna, keeping the title of the act with the second-most weeks atop the tally, while she will fall into third place.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/08/bts-match-one-of-rihannas-most-impressive-billboard-records/,BTS Match One Of Rihanna’s Most Impressive Billboard Records
"Kim Go-eun plays Yumi in the drama 'Yumi's Cells.' Yu-mi, the heroine of the Korean drama Yumi’s Cells, works as an accountant in a noodle company, but she also enjoys writing love stories. The cells in the title refer to the different cells in her brain that help her make or delay decisions. There’s a love cell, a hunger cell, an anxiety cell and a writer cell, just to name a few.  Actress Kim Go-eun, who plays Yu-mi, thinks viewers will find it easy to relate to Yumi’s thought processes. “Anyone can agonize over a problem and think ‘Is this better? Would that be better?’ as if cells were fighting in their head,” she said. “So I think it’s a concept that many people can relate to and enjoy. The expression, tone, and behavior of the cells change depending on the dialogue of the cells on set, so I try to harmonize the conditions of the cells with Yu-mi’s.” Deciding to play Yumi did not involve any agonizing on her part. She already enjoyed the webtoon that Yumi’s Cells is based on. “I’m a fan of the webtoon, and I think Yumi’s charm is her honesty and innocence,” said Kim. “I believe that’s what makes Yumi so lovely. And how Yumi matured in love and at work as the episodes progressed was what attracted me to the role.” The webtoon Yumi’s Cells ran for more than five years and attracted over three billion visitors, so there’s a certain amount of responsibility that comes with portraying such a beloved character. “Since the original is so good, a lot of people are working hard to make a great art piece like the original,” said Kim.  Kim's co-star in the drama is actor Ahn Bo-hyun. Quite a few recent hit Korean dramas—Nevertheless, Navillera, The Uncanny Counter, Kingdom, and True Beauty—are based on popular webtoons. Kim starred in the webtoon-based Cheese In The Trap, while her Yumi’s Cells co-star Ahn Bo-hyun starred in the webtoon-inspired drama Itaewon Class. The actress credits the heightened popularity of such dramas to the fresh source material. “It’s because webtoons use subject matter that isn’t commonly seen in previous dramas or movies, and there are many good works that can be reproduced in various ways,” she said. “That’s why it can form a solid fandom, and since the original work has already been verified by many, it is often used as a source for dramas and movies.” Kim acquired a solid fandom of her own after starring with Park Hae-jin in Cheese in the Trap, then starring with Gong Yoo in Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, aka Goblin and most recently acting with Lee Min-ho in The King: Eternal Monarch. Goblin became the fifth highest rated drama in Korean cable television history and won a Grand Prize at the 53rd Baeksang Arts Awards.  Past success does not create any pressure when it comes to choosing subsequent roles, said Kim. Nor does past success necessarily make acting any less challenging. “I am very grateful for the success of Goblin, but it doesn’t affect me when I choose a project or work on a project,” she said. “There’s always a sense of fear, excitement, and responsibility when I start a new project.” The actress debuted in the 2012 film A Muse which earned her several Best New Actress awards. Being naturally shy, she felt nervous at first, but acting quickly became exhilarating and she never wanted to stop. “When I act and when I am just me are different,” she said. “I’m not shy when I act because it is about showing and expressing a character, but I’m shy when I have to show myself and talk about myself.” Her upcoming drama will use a combination of live action and 3D animation to illustrate Yumi’s thought processes. It will be the first Korean drama to use the format. “Because it’ll be reborn as a live-action drama, there will be parts that couldn’t be expressed as a webtoon. So I think the fans who like the existing webtoon and also the viewers who have never read it will enjoy it.” The series, directed by Lee Sang-yeob of My Holo Love and Familiar Wife, is expected to premiere in 160 countries worldwide.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2021/09/08/kim-go-eun-thinks-yumis-cells-presents-a-very-relatable-concept/,Kim Go-Eun Thinks ‘Yumi’s Cells’ Presents A Very Relatable Concept
"Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf uses a Theragun on his left leg. When DK Metcalf’s knee was bothering him toward the end of last season, he used Therabody’s PowerDot once or twice week during team meetings. That electric muscle stimulator enabled to him flex his quadricep and strengthen his knee before practice. “It helped me stay on the field,” Metcalf said. Metcalf didn’t miss a game for the Seattle Seahawks in 2020 while setting career highs in receptions (83), yards (1,303) and touchdowns (10). The Seahawks wide receiver is part of a growing trend of NFL players using Therabody’s products. Metcalf and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins are investors, and five NFL teams — the Washington Football Team, New York Jets, Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and Cardinals — have partnerships with Therabody. The team partnerships, which integrate the company’s devices into their training and recovery programs, are limited to RecoveryAir, a pneumatic compression system that aids in recovery by boosting circulation and reducing swelling, and Theragun. (They do not include the company’s other product lines.) The Theragun, though, is the product for which Therabody is most well-known. Metcalf now only uses the PowerDot and the RecoveryAir as needed, but the Theragun PRO has become part of his regimen. He uses the Theragun to warm up before practice and then to recover after it. The percussive massage tool, which is designed to enhance muscle recovery, release tension and soothe discomfort, ranges in price from the mini at $199 to the Theragun PRO at $599. The origin of these products is a story unto itself — as one of the darkest days of Therabody’s founder and chief wellness officer led to one of his brightest inventions. On the way to taking his final physical therapy test at Cleveland Chiropractic College in Los Angeles in Oct. 10, 2007, Dr. Jason Wersland was cruising in his motorcycle toward the intersection of Inserstate-10 and Interstate-110. A car veered in front of him, and he slammed into it going 55 miles per hour. The impact broke his helmet. By December of 2007, Wersland was unable to move due to pain in his neck and on the right side of his body. “As a chiropractor,” Wersland said, “my only options are surgery and medication. Otherwise, you just have to deal with the pain, and no one’s equipped for that.” He got some temporary relief when putting VibraCussor, an old-school therapy device, under his armpit. But the amplitude — or the extent of a vibratory movement — of the instrument was too small, and his body also became used to it, mitigating the VibraCussor’s impact. Wersland, who grew up on a farm in Utah and was savvy with power tools, began designing his own, even messing with a blade-less SAWZALL.  “It just beat the crap out of my body,” he said. Tinkering and trial and error led to the first Theragun prototype in 2008. By 2011 he started treating NFL players at Unbreakable Performance Center, a gym located at the former Roxbury nightclub on Hollywood's Sunset Strip, after their workouts. Wersland launched his first commercially viable product in June of 2016. Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf uses a Theragun before and after practice. Therabody has grown its profits more than 30 times since 2017 and tripled its overall revenue. It expanded its international presence to more than 60 countries, and retailer distribution has increased from 40 stores in the U.S. to approximately 10,000 globally. Therabody also opened seven branded retail locations in the U.S. Rather than by giving demos to teams at the NFL Scouting Combine, Super Bowl or some other convention, his devices have spread through the NFL via individual relationships, word of mouth and Wersland’s work at Unbreakable. Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner saw one of the Theraguns there and began using it between sets before he did box jumps. “You don’t even know what you’re doing with this,” Wersland scolded him. Once instructed on the proper usage, Wagner bought one of his own and liked it so much that he became an investor. The first NFL player to buy one was another linebacker — James Anderson, who played seven of his 10 years with the Carolina Panthers. Anderson introduced Wersland to several players, and word spread to the team’s trainers. Wersland got his devices into the hands of who he calls “locker room heroes.” Like Anderson, these players were not necessarily the best players on their team, but they were influential with their teammates. Other percussive devices are used by NFL players, including Hyperice, which Patrick Mahomes invested in and is one of his many endorsements, but Wersland said that Therabody has different ergonomics, frequency, amplitude and torque. Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf uses Therabody's RecoveryAir, a pneumatic compression ... [+] system. Metcalf first began using Therabody’s Theragun and PowerDot in the training room during college at Ole Miss. The third-year pro then became an investor during the beginning of 2021 and is an ideal ambassador for the wellness company. When Metcalf chased down Cardinals safety Budda Baker last year, preventing a potential pick-six, it was one of the season’s most spectacular athletic plays and a memorable highlight. An athletic marvel, Metcalf has wowed with his chiseled physique, and his 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the 2019 NFL Combine was the fastest ever recorded for a player 225 pounds or heavier. “A health freak and then a fitness guy like myself, of course, I want to take care of my body,” Metcalf said. “I just like working with companies that fit my personality and my style of living.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffedotin/2021/09/08/therabodys-muscle-recovery-products-have-permeated-nfl-training-rooms/,Therabody’s Muscle Recovery Products Have Permeated NFL Training Rooms
"Pictured (left to right): Alexander “xoLebron” Lebron, Jack “JBM” Mascone, Justin “Just Awkward” ... [+] Howell, Ryan “Dayfri” Conger, Brandon “BRich” Richardson, and Antonio “Newdini” Newman of Wizards District Gaming Over the long Labor Day weekend, the NBA 2K League crowned a champion. Wizards District Gaming took home the title for the second consecutive year, defeating Jazz Gaming in a dominant three-game sweep at the Mavs Gaming Hub in Dallas, Texas.  This Finals looked different from those in previous years. It was the league’s first in-person playoffs since 2019. Not only that, a limited number of vaccinated fans and family attended the event. While Wizards DG is still likely riding high from their impressive win, this championship marks a turning point for the franchise and the league.  “I just feel like it's a big relief, you know,” Wizards’ center Ryan Conger, who goes by the gamertag Dayfri, said after hoisting the trophy. “I just feel like I can take a deep breath now and be like, ‘We did it.’ You know what I'm saying? And it's really cool because Jack's parents were here.” Jack Mascone, who’s gamertag is JBM, carried his team in Finals as his relatives cheered him on from the crowd. The former No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 2K League Draft, Mascone averaged 22.3 points and 11.3 assists in the series, dismantling whatever defense Jazz Gaming threw at him. His performance earned him Finals MVP honors.  The Finals MVP is just the latest in a long list of accomplishments for Mascone. He earned a gold medal with USA Basketball E-National Team, awarded the MVP of the 2020 FIBA Esports Open and won two NBA 2K League championships. Having achieved so much already, Mascone may have his sights set on another accomplishment beyond esports.  “I think Jack’s gone,” Conger says. “I think he’s going to college. He’s one of those guys—I don’t want to speak too much on it—he’s basically done what he’s needed to do. He’s been in the league two years and he’s won two championships. I can’t ask anything more from him.” Conger, too, is looking toward life after the league—although he isn’t ready to put down his controller just yet. The Dallas-area native wants to return home and start a food truck with his dad. It’s something they’ve been talking about for a while. Conger says that his earnings from playing in the NBA 2K League will go a long way in helping make their food truck dream become a reality.  “We are going to travel to baseball tournaments,” says Conger, who played collegiate baseball. “We’re going to go there and just show up in the morning. We’ll do breakfast tacos in the morning and toward the end of the day we’ll do barbecue, probably in the Waxahachie area, Midlothian—kind of in that area. Once we get a little bigger, try to get up in Dallas and stuff.” So, for Wizards District Gaming, it’s a time to celebrate but also one in which change seems inevitable moving forward. The same is true for the league. But where the Wizards may be looking at a potential rebuild, the NBA 2K League is eyeing growth and expansion.  Returning to in-person play with a limited, live audience was huge for the league. After two-years of remote play, the atmosphere created by a live setting made for an engaging and emotional experience for players and onlookers alike. It’s in-person play that the league is looking to get back to full-time—when it’s safe. Not only does it create a unique, energetic ambiance, it can affect a player’s approach to the game, especially if all they’ve known is remote game play.  “The players that played on the stage for the first time last weekend had to make an adjustment to whether they’re comfortable on the stage or not,” says NBA 2K League President Brendan Donohue. “We saw some players actually play a little bit unusually out of character for them, and we saw some players step right into it, lean into it and excel.” Yet, while a return to the in-person experience is a focus, the league isn’t sitting on its hands and waiting for that day to arrive. Rather, it’s pressing forward in other areas. This year will be the first time it's held an All-Star Game.     Seven players, selected by their peers, coaches, fans and media, will represent the Eastern and Western Conferences. What makes the game interesting is that it will be the first time that the 2K League players will be playing on the latest version of the game, NBA 2K22, which is the same edition available to the public.  The All-Star Game is just one part of Donohue’s long-term plans for the league. In 2020, it welcomed its first international team into its ranks, the Gen.G Tigers of Shanghai, China. Further global expansion and more in-person events, like the playoffs, are the future of the league, Donohue believes.  “I think having a team in Europe, having more teams in Asia, I think that’s when you’re going to see a new stair-step for the whole league,” Donohue says. “I think bringing this experience to Dallas, to more markets—I think when people come to view this, they get it and they realize how cool it is.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2021/09/08/nba-2k-league-wizards-district-gaming-look-to-the-future-after-successful-finals/,"NBA 2K League, Wizards District Gaming Look To The Future After Successful Finals"
"X-energy’s Xe-100 reactor uses spherical fuel elements, tennis ball-sized pebbles made of thousands ... [+] of TRISO micro-fuel particles that contain HALEU. Thousands of pebbles are amassed to create a gas-cooled reactor core that cannot melt down. Correction – the size of the TRISO particles are 0.85 mm not 0.5 mm.  The cost and fabrication of fuel for nuclear reactors has never been a big deal. Because of its incredibly high energy density, thousands of times less uranium is needed than coal or natural gas to produce the same amount of energy.  As a result, the cost of nuclear fuel is a small part of the overall cost of nuclear power, barely 10%, and most of that is fabrication. The cost of nuclear power has nothing to do with the cost of uranium. When uranium prices rose 1,000% in 2007, it had little to no effect on the price of nuclear power.  In contrast, the cost of the fossil fuel itself is the majority of the cost of fossil fuel power, over 80%. Therefore, the cost of their power goes up and down directly with the cost of the fuel, particularly natural gas and oil.  From the physics of nuclear power, the higher the enrichment of U-235 to U-238, the higher the burn-up rate and power levels of the reactor, the longer the fuel can perform in the reactor before having to be replaced, and the more energy that can be obtained from a specific amount of fuel. This last point is key to the future of nuclear power. The more energy resulting from each ton of fuel is critical for driving costs down and reducing the amount of fuel needed to power society, as well as the amount of waste. The higher the enrichment, the less the amount of long-lived isotopes in the resulting nuclear waste. That is why most advanced reactor designs call for using higher enrichments. Staying between 10% and 20% enriched U-235 avoids weapons issues. This is termed High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel.  Most nuclear power reactors use Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) which is enriched only to about 3% to 5% U-235. We’ve known this for a while. The hurdles are only political and bureaucratic. Of course, I use the term “only” very loosely. These hurdles are usually more difficult than any technical or scientific hurdle. As in most supply chains, the amount of material produced is just about what is needed. Having excess inventory on hand doesn’t help with nuclear since nuclear power plants have at least two years’ worth of fuel onsite at any time. This CANDU/PHWR nuclear fuel bundle looks identical to the CCTE’s new ANEEL fuel bundle but with a ... [+] different composition and configuration of U/Th, and uses HALEU. Both, the current CANDU/PHWR and ANEEL fuel bundles are about 50 cm long and 10 cm in diameter.  So the claim that insufficient supplies of HALEU will hinder new reactor design deployment is hollow. The reason there is no commercial supply of HALEU in North America at the moment is because there were no companies with a likelihood of producing reactors soon enough that would need that fuel - until now.  The primary source of commercially-available HALEU today is from Russia. But there are enrichment facilities in the United States and elsewhere that produce LEU that could be ramped up in less time than the reactors can be deployed. Enrichment facilities are not that difficult to build.  But the United States is moving forward. The latest URENCO enrichment facility in Eunice, New Mexico went into LEU production only four years after regulatory approval, and they have recently announced a program to produce HALEU and to construct a facility dedicated to just that. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory will produce HALEU for upcoming new reactor demonstrations and for new fuels like CCTE’s ANEEL that will replace older fuels in some existing reactor designs.  In addition, BWX Technologies has a contract with INL to expand and upgrade its TRIstructural-ISOtropic (TRISO) nuclear fuel manufacturing line. TRISO is the fuel for pebble-bed and other advanced reactors, and uses HALEU. DOE has also promised to provide the first fuel load of HALEU for Oklo’s micro-reactor, the Aurora Powerhouse. This particular HALEU is being made with spent fuel, which is not a workable solution for many advanced reactors, but Oklo plans to produce its own HALEU soon. To address the overall problem of domestic supply, Congress has ordered DOE to enable more HALEU production. The Department is developing a plan to establish that supply. Several commercial entities are gearing up for HALEU production around the world. Orano Conversion & Enrichment, a multinational nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Hauts-de-Seine, France, is assessing the enrichment market and the expected requirements for HALEU in anticipation of supplying HALEU. But nuclear fuel and services provider Centrus Energy is ahead of most competitors. Their commercial-scale, domestic facility in Piketon, Ohio, Centrus will produce HALEU needed to fuel many next-generation reactor designs, including the recently announced Natrium Power Storage System designed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, as well as new fuels like CCTE’s ANEEL fuel that is a mixture of HALEU and thorium. Having already received license-approval from NRC, Centrus expects to start production in 2022, which would certainly handle any domestic needs over the next ten years. So don’t worry that fuel supply is some kind of bottleneck in the advance of nuclear power. The fuel will come well before the reactors.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2021/09/08/supplying-new-types-of-nuclear-fuel-with-haleu-is-not-a-problem/,Supplying New Types Of Nuclear Fuel With HALEU Is Not A Problem
"Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs attempting to pass while under pressure from the Buccaneers' Shaquil Barrett during Super Bowl LV in February. The NFL season kicks off tomorrow with the Buccaneers hosting the Cowboys. For the moment, all 32 teams want to believe they can match Tampa Bay’s success last season, even if they know disaster could be lurking right around the corner. They should at least have their fans cheering them on in person—with these stadiums requiring proof of vaccination from attendees—and they could receive more attention than ever as legalized sports gambling spreads through the U.S. (Check out our guide to the bets to watch for each team.) Here’s what you need to know to get ready for the league’s first 17-game season. With the AFC East in transition, the Bills once again look like the class of the division, and perhaps a real threat to make their first Super Bowl appearance since the 1993 season. The Dolphins’ quarterback may be at a crossroads in just his second year. (The franchise has already turned one corner, though, with its profitability.) The Jets, after cutting bait on Sam Darnold, are relying on rookie Zach Wilson, who had an up-and-down training camp and lost a weapon at tight end. The defense is also unsettled, with Shaq Lawson coming in but pass-rushers Carl Lawson and Vinny Curry lost for the season. The Patriots, too, are handing the keys to a rookie quarterback, with high hopes for a revamped tight end group and a rushing attack that, behind Damien Harris, should be one of the league’s best. Also look for contributions from a towering offensive tackle in his second stint with the team and a kicker who makes it 18 straight years with an undrafted rookie on New England’s initial 53-man roster. The Browns have come a long way in a short time, with a rebuilt defense pairing Jadeveon Clowney with Myles Garrett, healthy again after being hampered by Covid-19 last year. Nick Chubb, the ultimate team player, will lead the offense after signing a contract extension that makes a lot of sense for both sides. The Steelers, whose brutal schedule means the Ben Roethlisberger era could come to an end January 9, created uncertainty on the offensive line but used the savings to add a major piece on defense. The Bengals’ coach may already be on the hot seat. The Ravens, with a reinforced offensive line, want to revamp their offense as they also shake up their marketing operation with a data partnership. The Texans might have the NFL’s least talented roster, and while the Jaguars have an exciting prospect in Trevor Lawrence, the AFC South ought to come down to the Colts and the Titans. With more aggressive play-calling, Ryan Tannehill could propel Tennessee. Indianapolis took some big gambles this off-season but could get a breakout year from its lead running back. The Raiders have a renovated defense to go with a potent offense, and the Broncos will see if a stopgap quarterback can save their coach’s job. The Chargers think Justin Herbert can build on a stellar rookie season in a more explosive offense that also features Austin Ekeler, a fantasy football darling as both a player and an analyst. Brandon Staley, the 38-year-old defensive whiz now serving as Los Angeles’ head coach, has an X-factor in Derwin James Jr., who has been sidetracked by injuries since his All-Pro 2018 season. The Chiefs have laughed off Patrick Mahomes’ comment about going 20-0 but believe they’ve learned from their Super Bowl loss and won’t let it happen again. Jarran Reed and Alex Okafor should elevate the pass-rush. The offense has a promising rookie at tight end, a deeper line featuring a bargain at guard, and a new emphasis on the running game, bolstered by the acquisition of Jerick McKinnon. Of course, the star is Mahomes, who has been working hard off the field with a new shoe, a new ad campaign and a new investment in wearable devices. Kansas City will face an early challenge, with games against both of its most recent AFC playoff opponents in the season’s first five weeks. The Cowboys—the NFL’s most valuable team at $6.5 billion, up 14% on the league’s lucrative new media deals—are getting back Dak Prescott, now a restaurateur and football’s highest-paid player. On defense, Randy Gregory is facing a make-or-break season. The Eagles have made a historic hire in their front office and have gone through an analytics revolution. The Washington Football Team put a Band-Aid on its quarterback situation while starting a youth movement. (It also made Brandon Scherff the league’s highest-paid guard by hitting him with the franchise tag again.) After a free-agency spending spree, the Giants had three off-season acquisitions retire during camp but are happy to welcome back Saquon Barkley and see if Daniel Jones can take a leap forward for an offense that must show improvement. Eli Manning will be lending a hand in the front office, and the franchise will be diving into cryptocurrency.  The Lions will start Jared Goff after an off-season trade, and the Bears are killing time until a quarterback switch of their own, to Justin Fields, after trading up to draft him. They are also exploring a possible move to the suburbs. The Packers are looking for a last hurrah with Aaron Rodgers after a drama-filled off-season that left at least one NFL executive questioning his commitment. He’ll have help, though, from a talented roster that features a breakout cornerback, an All-Pro lineman on the mend and stars like Davante Adams and Za’Darius Smith. After an off-season makeover to address 2020’s miserable showing on defense, the Vikings expect a bounce-back, with Danielle Hunter and Everson Griffen returning to a line that will play a pivotal role. Depth is still an issue, particularly at receiver, and the offensive line remains a concern, but with weapons like Dalvin Cook and Irv Smith Jr., Kirk Cousins and Mike Zimmer have no excuses in 2021. The Buccaneers have a ready-to-repeat roster but still have room for improvement on offense. The rest of the NFC South is on shakier ground. The Panthers are trying to turn around Sam Darnold’s career, the Falcons are searching for a spark while sticking with Matt Ryan, and the Saints are transitioning from Drew Brees, who is staying busy in retirement. The Rams got their man in Matthew Stafford, who now faces immense pressure. A trade for Sony Michel should help a low-budget backfield that lost Cam Akers to a season-ending injury, with left tackle Andrew Whitworth still paving the way in his 16th NFL season. The 49ers, who will anoint Trey Lance at quarterback sooner or later, are having their depth strained before the season’s start but have talent, including George Kittle, who made the fraternity of tight ends a bit more official this off-season. Some might question the logic of spending lavishly on an inside linebacker, but Fred Warner’s new contract gives San Francisco flexibility, and he is arguably the most important player on the defense. The Seahawks want to expand their offense in more creative ways, and the Cardinals hope to see progress from Kyler Murray, a new member of the gaming organization FaZe Clan.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/09/08/nfl-preview-what-you-need-to-know-as-the-2021-season-kicks-off/,NFL Preview: What You Need To Know As The 2021 Season Kicks Off
"USV 'Ranger' fires an SM-6. One of the U.S. Defense Department’s two prototype robot warships just fired its first missile.  The military on Friday hailed the test-launch of an SM-6 missile from the Unmanned Surface Vessel Ranger, sailing off the California coast, as “game-changing.” It’s one thing for an unmanned vessel to launch a missile, however. It’s quite another for the same vessel autonomously to find and fix targets.  The real “game-changer” will come when Ranger or another USV plugs into a wide-ranging command-and-control and data network—one that works in the stress of battle.  The Navy for years has been signalling its intention to supplement, if not partially replace, its traditional manned warships with large numbers of inexpensive USVs. A tentative fleet plan that the administration of President Joe Biden released in June proposes to add between 77 and 140 unmanned ships and submarines to a long-term force of between 321 and 372 manned vessels. To that end, the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office has acquired the two prototype USVs and is planning on buying two more before handing the program over to the U.S. Navy in 2022.  Lawmakers gave the project around $100 million for the effort last year. The program asked for $150 million for 2022. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency itself owned a pair of smaller USVs and handed those over to the Navy back in 2018. The USVs Nomad and Ranger are former civilian fast supply vessels, dozens of which crisscross the Gulf of Mexico supporting oil platforms. The Pentagon painted the 175-foot vessels gray and added computers and communications equipment, as well as artificial intelligence systems developed by Raytheon.  Both USVs made the 4,000-mile trip from the Gulf Coast through the Panama Canal to their home port San Diego—Ranger in October, Nomad in June.  The transits were opportunities to test the vessels’ autonomous navigation abilities. With sailors in San Diego keeping watch, the USVs steered themselves to the canal, at which point pilots boarded the vessels to guide them through to the Pacific Ocean. Ranger was the first to get weapons. The Navy installed a quad-pack of launchers for Raytheon’s SM-6, a ballistic missile with a multi-mode seeker. The $5 million SM-6 nominally is an air-defense missile, but the Navy steadily has been expanding the munitions target set to include ballistic missiles, ships and targets on land. The launchers lie flat in a shipping container before angling upward to fire.  Some time before Sept. 3, controllers on land commanded Ranger to fire one SM-6. “Such innovation drives the future of joint capabilities,” the Pentagon crowed. But it’s not hard to fire a missile. It is hard to fire a missile at a legitimate target during the chaos of combat. Surveillance forces must find and identify, say, an enemy warship among the thousands of civilian vessels crowding shipping lanes. A wide array of scouts could feed data into the network. Manned planes and ships. Drones. Other robotic vessels. Even Marine Corps battalions hiding out on remote islands. The surveilers must pass to the unmanned shooter, as well as to controllers on land, a detailed target track—coordinates where a missile should aim in order to put it close enough to the enemy for the missile’s own seeker to work.  This delicate hand-off of data must occur fast across potentially thousands of miles while the enemy is jamming sensors and radios and interfering with satellites.  The Pentagon knows that the sensor and command network is key to making the USVs work. The same SCO that acquired the USVs also has been working on the network.  The developers are optimistic. The USV program “delivers a distributed sensor network that can navigate and operate with man in/on the loop oversight, and will be capable of weeks-long deployments and trans-oceanic transits,” the Defense Department stated. The proof will come in the form of a realistic trial—one that tests the sensors, the network and a missile-packing robot ship.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/08/the-pentagons-robot-warships-just-fired-their-first-missiles/,The Pentagon’s Robot Warship Just Fired Its First Missile
"Mahindra's smaller tractors are well-positioned for the growing markets of hobby farms and female ... [+] farmers. Mahindra makes the best-selling farm tractor on earth, and is number three–and the fastest-growing brand–in the U.S. Yet I’d never heard of them until recently, so that certainly piqued my interest. Perusing their website, I learned that they built Jeeps right after WWII, and then had a joint venture with International Harvester to produce Mahindra-badged Farmall-style tractors in the 1960s. Well, I’m a Jeep Gladiator owner, and when I was a little boy I had a toy Farmall (red, of course) I carried with me everywhere I went, so I knew I had to learn more. It’s really the story of two companies. The first is the parent company, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It has over 58,000 employees and a market capitalization of $13.7 billion, and had $11 billion in sales in fiscal 2021. It was founded in 1945 as steel trading firm Mahindra & Mohammed, later branching out into steelmaking, automotive assembly, and farm equipment. It was in 1947 that company, having by then changed its name to Mahindra & Mahindra, began assembling the aforementioned Jeeps from parts produced by Willys Overland. In 1961 it established the JV with International Harvester, and it was that move that would launch the company into making tractors for itself in 1977. Today its automotive business brings in just over 55% of its revenue, while farm equipment (they sell about 200,000 tractors a year worldwide) brings in just shy of 41%. The rest is divided among a number of other business areas, including IT, aerospace parts, boats, construction equipment and clean energy. Mahindra's U.S. headquarters in Houston, Texas. The other company is Mahindra Ag North America, a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Houston, Texas. “We’ve been around for 26 years now,” said President and CEO Viren Popli. “The U.S. started as an export market for us, an opportunistic one where we asked what we could be made in India to sell in the U.S. But we’ve transitioned to what we should design and manufacture specifically for the U.S. market.” Rather than go head-to-head against the big American producers like John Deere and New Holland, Mahindra chose to focus on the market for small tractors. “In the U.S., a lot of small farms consolidated into bigger farms with bigger equipment,” said Popli. “We stayed focused on tractors of less than 125 hp. In India the average farm size is five acres, and the owner might rent another five, ten, fifteen or twenty acres. A tractor there is a major capital investment. For us it’s not a Swiss Army knife, it’s more like a Rambo knife–something that does lots of different jobs and lasts forever. What we bring to the U.S. from that is a machine that’s solid and heavy-duty, one that’s high-efficiency, has great fuel economy, does multiple tasks and is easy to repair.” The Mahindra 6075 Power Shuttle Cab Tractor with grappler attachment. The American side subsidiary had other considerations to address as well. “India doesn’t get down to negative 35˚ F at night,” Popli explained. “And our tractors also have to work in a Houston summer. Plus, Indian farmers and American farmers have size differences, which affects our design for everything from gears and levers to entry and exit to seat springs. Also, many U.S. farmers are women, adding to those challenges. But then we can also take our learning back to India to encourage women there.” That attention to their end user isn’t lost on American farmers like Abbie Spackman, who runs her own organic vegetable business, The Heirloom Farmer, from a section of her family’s century farm–one that’s been owned by the same family for at least a hundred years–near Port Matilda, Pennsylvania. “Most farmers bleed red or bleed green,” she said, referring to the top two U.S. farm tractor brands’ colors. “We were never like that–we always just used what worked. Our local dealer had Mahindras, so my family bought two of them a couple years ago. I love the cabs to keep out the weather and bugs. I’m small, but they’re really adjustable and I’m able to reach the pedals, so I feel very comfortable operating them.” Pennsylvania farmer Abbie Spackman. Spackman loved the new tractors so much, she posted about them on social media earlier this year, made connections with the folks at Mahindra, and has since starred in some of their promotional YouTube videos. She echoed Popli’s ideas about female farmers. “A lot more women are interested in operating their own equipment,” she said. “Even with my size and ability, Mahindras are easy to operate. They’re a great place for women to start.” Additionally, Spackman has a “day job” with AgrAbility PA, a program providing support to farmers with disabilities or long-term health conditions. “Mahindra tractors are a good fit for folks with those kinds of challenges,” she added. “This isn’t about selling a product–it’s about building a relationship,” Popli said. “A given farmer might have 40 harvests. We challenge ourselves to see how many of those we can get done on a Mahindra. We have dealers who’ve been with us for generations.” To continue that, the company is looking to the future. “We’re working on a whole new range in the next three to four years, designed specifically for the U.S. We’re looking at new areas like orchards and dairy. There are some broad trends in U.S. agriculture that position us well. People are migrating from cities back to rural areas. There’s a big focus on the environment, and what companies are doing to protect it, so our support for precision farming and our low emissions are strengths. And there’s a greater interest in where food comes from, with more people interested in organic and healthier eating. These are all significant opportunities for us.” The Mahindra 5100 tractor with disc harrow and front end loader attachments. In addition to its tractors, Mahindra offers tractor attachments, implements and accessories, all aimed at bolstering their problem-solving mission. “We think through this: what does our customer do and need? A lot of them have needs that are currently met but not fully solved. That’s what we want to fix. We’re strongly embedded in the communities we serve. We strongly encourage family businesses in our dealer network. We stand for the little guy, the underdog.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2021/09/08/with-the-1-farm-tractor-in-the-world-mahindra-looks-to-supercharge-its-us-business/,"With The #1 Farm Tractor In The World, Mahindra Looks To Supercharge Its U.S. Business"
"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has threatened to take legal action against cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase if it follows through with plans to launch a crypto lending product, according to company executives Wednesday, who criticized the regulator’s decision to “skip basic regulatory steps” and jump straight to litigation without providing guidance to the industry.   Coinbase executives said the SEC threatened to sue over its new lending product.  The SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells notice—a formal warning that the agency intends to sue—if it carries through with plans to launch the new product, called Lend, chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a blog post. Grewal said the regulator considered Lend, which allows users to earn interest on digital assets, a security, a designation the company does not agree with. Grewal, alongside Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong, said the agency refused to explain how or why it made the decision and accused it of eschewing standard regulatory protocol in favor of legal action, all without providing “a single bit of actual guidance” to the industry on these kinds of products.   Armstrong, who said the SEC also requested records and testimony from employees, accused the regulator of “sketchy behavior” and of making a “land grab” compared to other regulators. Lend’s launch will be delayed until “at least October” amid the regulatory uncertainty, Grewal said. The SEC did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.   Armstrong said Coinbase is “committed to following the law” and acknowledged that this is sometimes unclear. However, he said the SEC has not published any guidance for industry and was the only regulator to decline meeting with him when he travelled to Washington, D.C., in May. “If we end up in court we may finally get the regulatory clarity the SEC refuses to provide,” Armstrong tweeted. “But regulation by litigation should be the last resort for the SEC, not the first.”    In April, Coinbase made history as the first major cryptocurrency company to go public in the U.S. Its success signaled crypto’s move towards the mainstream and highlighted the lack of clear regulations covering the sector. It’s a gap regulators around the world are keen to rectify and SEC chair Gary Gensler has told a House committee there was a possible need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges. The SEC has told us it wants to sue us over Lend. We don’t know why.

"On the road where it (might) belong. The electrification of transportation continues to touch new segments, and one category that’s prime for EV conversion is the off-road segment. And while there are (or at least will be) familiar faces like Polaris in the mix with their electrified Ranger side-by-side, a planned offering by startup RINDEV is taking things to another level - and it got me thinking about what’s possible. RINDEV’s Tron-ified Unity electric side-by-side concept sounds like a total hoot while crossing the wilderness, but I wonder: Why can’t this be a car? Because I’d drive it. RINDEV claims the Unity will sport some truly impressive specs: 507 horsepower, a massive 812 pound-feet of torque and 350 miles of range for the top-spec $39,999 model, or 250 miles of go for $29,999. Long-travel suspension offers a towering 21 inches of cushion and electric all-wheel drive is standard for the 32-inch mud-hunting tires, but RINDEV did not say how many motors would provide thrust or what a top speed might be. However it ends up being configured, towing capacity is targeted at 3,000 pounds. While all the windows are removable for a more open-air experience, all sealed up the Unity will feature heat and A/C - and a very car-like appearance. Just add some wipers.  With no complicated gas engine and a simplified drive train, the Unity could be a sweet road ... [+] vehicle. But maybe only on Fury Road.  Jokes aside, those are truck numbers for the most part, and far beyond the specs (and price) of the e-Ranger. Other niceties include 120-volt output for tools and such, and charging capabilities from Level III fast chargers to plugging it into a wall socket. My initial impression of the renders RINDEV sent me ahead of today’s website upgrade had me dreaming of hitting the pedal as deep snow piled up on some rural Oregon roads, heading to the local gathering spot all snug in my heated sci-fi Unity cabin in a too-cool crawler trimmed with LED lights. Make it so! With over 500hp, 800+foot pounds of torque and 21 inches of suspension travel, the Unity could be ... [+] the ultimate bug-out vehicle.  When I leave the urban confines of Portland and venture out onto the tiny lines across Oregon’s wide open spaces on my dual-sport motorcycle, side-by-side machines are common on the streets of many rural towns and outposts I ride through, especially in alpine areas that see snow and heavy weather. Out there, the RINDEV Unity would be an off-road Cadillac of the category. And given the crumbling infrastructure in many cities, it doesn’t seem like a bad idea for getting around in bigger burgs, either.  I understand that bringing a vehicle like the Unity up to DOT spec is a whole other ball of yarn for a company just getting going like RINDEV, but if Arcimoto can do it, well, there’s hope that the FUV and CyberTruck won’t be the only out-there choices for urban exploration in the near future. $100 pre-orders for the RINDEV Unity opened just a week ago and have tallied over a $1 million so far, according to the company. So far, a specific production timetable has not been announced. Beach buggy? Forest crawler? With windows removed, the Unity carries a more SxS stance, but still ...

"A MobilEye robotaxi prototype, branded with Moovit, which will deploy in Munich by 2022, Intel says. At the IAA Mobility conference in Munich Intel 
  
  INTC 
  and Sixt’s CEOs announced a plan for a robotaxi service in Munich in 2022. The service will be run by Sixt (one of Europe’s leading car rental firms0 and integrated with Moovit, a mobility app company purchased by Intel previously. Promised is an Uber 
  
  UBER 
 -like service, with Moovit branding, Luminar LIDARs and of course MobilEye computer vision chips. This joins a variety of robotaxi pilot projects in the USA, China and now Europe and Israel. Details are few, including when the rides will begin with no safety driver in the vehicle — a key stepping stone which was recently made legal in Germany once a process is complete. There is earlier coverage here on Forbes.com but it’s worth discussing the bigger trends behind this announcement. Not long ago, there were broad claims that we were in a robocar winter — that the technology was still a decade away, if not more, and car OEMs were all pulling back. Most of them did pull back, but the companies dedicated to Robotaxi, like Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, MobilEye, AutoX, Baidu, WeRide, Motional, Argo, Aurora and others, as well as the trucking firms, barely noticed any winter. Right now, companies keep their true performance close to the vest — except Waymo which has been willing to publish real statistics on their pilot operations, though only some of them. As such, what matters, and shows how far along they think they are, is what they are willing to do that’s risky. This includes steps like offering service to the general public, and of course operating with no safety driver on board. To a lesser extent, it includes announcing firm dates for when you will do this, but dates slip notoriously. (Indeed, nobody believes dates from Elon Musk any more at all.) Also important to factor in are how difficult the driving territory is, and if hard parts have been excluded. Waymo’s launch in San Francisco will exclude downtown; their first pilot in Chandler is about the easiest place to drive there is. AutoX keeps to a fairly calm suburb of Shenzhen, though it is more complex than Chandler to be sure. Baidu uses a very small area and keeps safety drivers on board. We don’t yet know what territory MobilEye will serve, though almost all of Tel Aviv is challenging to drive. Germany is an odd first choice. While they have passed a law that will allow this, it generally a place with more bureaucracy than the other contenders. It is less clear how quickly the safety drivers will be removed, even if it is legal. The taxi lobbies in Germany have had success against Uber and will not be enthused with this project either. Operating an Uber-like service is a worthwhile milestone, and offering it to the general public is particularly important. Once it’s offered to the general public is a sign the team feels much more ready, and is willing to give up more control. Members of the public will see your warts, and video them and put them up on YouTube. Waymo got a lot of derision for this embarrassing performance in a construction zone but the reality is, we saw this because they were letting the public ride. Other teams that keep things more under wraps are almost surely doing worse. Removing safety drivers in theory is a minor step, because by the time you do it, you need a safety record so good that they are not doing anything any more. Removing them shows you’ve reached that point, and reached it a while ago. In some cases, team leave cars under constant remote monitoring (ie. with one remote operator per vehicle.) A better milestone happens when each remote operator is handling many vehicles. But an Uber-style ride-hail service is also just a stepping stone. The robotaxi revolution doesn’t happen when you can make a modestly cheaper Uber. (Some even wonder how viable a business Uber really is, given the amount of investor subsidy it has needed.)  To make a working robotaxi service, you have to reach the level of car replacement. That people decide to give up car ownership because of your service. They don’t need to use your service exclusively. The car replacement will include regular human driven taxis, daily rent-a-car, transit, e-bikes, minimobility and other tools. And the first car replacement will be taking 3 car families down to 2, and 2 down to 1 which are much easier than getting somebody to zero. Still, it’s only when the robotaxi service covers a large enough area at a good enough price that somebody decides to sell a car that we move into the world-changing department. Nobody is yet there, though Europe might be the sort of place that can happen sooner. The use of Sixt and Moovit is unclear here. While Moovit as an app is one people use to make trips, it’s not obvious that people using it will be the ones to suddenly want to summon a robotaxi with it. It’s more for people in the transit market with a focus on low cost at present. It is not clear that early robotaxi companies gain a lot by partnering with existing transportation apps, even Uber or Lyft. While Uber may be the most popular app people pull up to find a taxi-like ride, dedicated apps for novel new services like this will work fine for now. Only in the future, when a proper car replacement service is ready, will people quest for a multi-use app. Sixt is known only for car rental. They will do fine at maintaining the fleet and operating it, but their value to the customer is less strong. It’s really Intel/MobilEye who are the key provider in this game.

"This Latin American car reads ""Sells itself"", which is contrary to the truth in much of Central and ... [+] South America due to fraud and distrust. Many an inventor’s dreams and prophecies contain lofty goals such as “changing the world”, but few inventions in each generation truly shift the needs and underlying commerce of the population. The iPhone generated a market of handheld mobility which altered the way the populous consumed news and communicated socially. Before that, the Internet established new networks of information which transformed daily activities from product shopping to business meetings to even taxi summoning. But to look for an automotive invention that has transformed a market, the economist must search as far back as the 19th century and either Karl Benz for the invention of the automobile itself or Henry Ford for the quasi-invention of paying employees exorbitantly ($5/day) to create affordability for the horseless carriage. Arguably, though, the connected vehicle may soon have that same impact in Latin America countries in the coming years, and it’s worth a look at the current state as well as the near-future reality that’s already unfolding.  Between Mexico, Central America and South America, there are nearly 700 million people, which for reference is nearly double the combined population of the United States and Canada. However, the economies of many Latin American countries do not compare. The Gross Domestic Product per capita for Latin America and the Caribbean is only slightly over $7,400 per person, whereas the U.S. and Canada are presently at $65,297 and $46,194 respectively. There are many foundational reasons for these economic differences (e.g., political unrest, natural resources), but some of the root causes stem from mobility, lending and insurance. · Mobility: Getting to a professional position requires the ability to travel efficiently for work and affording that mobility must be enabled by the steady income. Chicken-and-egg. In fact, OurWorldData.org created a striking graph which shows the correlated, parabolic curve of GDP per capita versus the number of vehicles per 1000 residents: it’s simply harder to create revenue without mobility, but mobility is needed to create the revenue. Much of Latin America has not overcome this obstacle. Argentina owns the dubious honor of the most vehicles per 1000 residents (320) for Latin American countries, but mostly because many countries like Bolivia and Columbia are under 100 vehicles. None of them are within a stone’s throw of the United States (866) and Canada (685). · Lending: Banks typically provide money based upon risk. For the worker trying to climb out of the chicken-and-egg scenario, a used car loan would typically be a lesser risk. However, used vehicles in Latin America represent two hazards to insurance companies: hidden problems and theft. “40% of all transaction come with some type of scam such as you’re buying a car with something broken, but the buyer doesn’t disclose the issue,” states Anthony Ben Sadoun, Chief Product Officer of Kavak. “The buyer, in essence, is getting robbed.” For instance, July floods in Columbia killed several people and affected thousands with an untold number of clandestine dangers inside the wells of flooded vehicles, many of which will be resold without admission. And even if the resell goes well, theft drives up the risk for the banks thinking about financing. As stated well by a blogging traveler on Lonely Planet, “On the trip your every waking moment must be concerned with the car. You cannot just park it … since the car represents several year's income to most thieves.” That translates to very few vehicle loans for the fledgling buyer.  “In Mexico, approximately 95% of all transactions happen without financing,” explains Sadoun. “In Brazil, it’s 75%, which is very different than car sales in the United States where most significant purchases are made without tying-up their entire life savings.” · Insurance: Now maybe this neophyte wage earner wants to secure his significant-investment-sans-financing by purchasing car insurance. However, insurance companies are aware of the same aforementioned consequences of deceit and theft. Therein, insurance penetration is quite low: only 23% of vehicles are insured in Brazil (with Mexico being much lower) versus 88% in the United States. Data from the vehicles can create a foundation of trust upon which the mercantile economy can build. Service providers have created connected “dongles” which – when connected to the service port (a.k.a. OBD II port) – can transmit data from the vehicle’s network to data centers. Using this data, the service providers become informed experts on any given vehicle and are now acting as brokers during a whole series of financial exchanges; essentially creating an ecosystem for bringing usable, trusted vehicles to the masses. Such stability could be the equivalent of hitting the economic reset button for a large swath of the world. · Buying: With terabytes of information, providers can understand what vehicle purchases could be risky and specifically where to investigate when buying a vehicle. “There are so many things you can do with data,” says Sadoun. “With every vehicle [Kavak] considers for our inventory, we can understand and be confident about what it would take to recondition the vehicle based upon knowing typical failures for a make, model, mileage, territory and conditions in which it’s been driven.” Some of this is based upon prognostics where algorithms predict soon-to-be-failures, and some is based upon heuristics where previous data suggests “likely areas of concern” worth investigation before buying, refurbishing and reselling the vehicle as the trusted provider. · Lending and Insuring: The first anxiety of the banks and insurers was previously concerns of underwriting a questionable purchase, but this is mitigated by a data-enabled understanding of the vehicle’s quality. Theft, though, would typically still be an issue. However, just like OnStar or LoJack, connected cars provide some ability to prevent theft. Yes, hubcaps can still be stolen without any cellular-enabled sensors, but keeping track of the overall vehicle still allows the borrower to make it to work and pay off the loan while not submitting a substantial claim.   It might seem to the casual reader that comparisons of the connected car to inventions like the iPhone are hyperbole given the many challenges facing the Latin American communities, especially given many mobility inventions in the past have fallen well short of original expectations (e.g., Segways, flying cars). On the other hand, though, few probably predicted the enabling impact of a singular employer like Ford doubling wages and making an automobile and lifestyle achievable. Automobiles can change lives.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevetengler/2021/09/08/connected-car-the-upcoming-catalyst-for-the-latin-american-market/,Connected Car: The Upcoming Catalyst For The Latin American Market
"Indian actress Richa Chadha features in her first crime-thriller-horror project, 'Candy' Indian actor Richa Chadha’s latest outing, VOOT original web series Candy is starts streaming online from September 8, Wednesday. It is her second web series and she insists the new show is not just about a crime but also about parenting and father figures.  Asked about her preparation for the role, Chadha shares that she met female cops to understand how they go about their daily lives. “Mentally, there was no preparation. I just needed an understanding of what their real lives are and the pressures they have as women. I got to see closely, how a large part of domestic responsibilities still rests on their shoulders. Many of the cops whom I met, also had police officers as their husbands and they even shared some of the domestic duties. However, when things would go wrong, it was always the woman making calls. Things like making calls about kids having to be picked up from school or a parent-teacher-meet to be attended or whether the in-laws’ sugar is stable, all these things were the sole responsibility of the women. In this aspect, they were like very normal household women.”  Not many actors may be as attentive as to notice how women in such scenarios walk around with different postures when at home and when in professional set up. Chadha adds, “And then. these women step out of the house and they have a gun and a holster. Then they correct their postures (to a stiff one). I got to see the ‘everydayness’ of their lives. These women are not bothered about seeing a corpse or blood, they are not afraid. I am not generalizing but that is how they function. Perhaps they get used to it all.”  She also adds that she has actually not faced as much as many working women in India. “Even in this show, I am playing a DSP (deputy superintendent of police), so the powers that come with that (are there). She has a significantly higher rank, a DSP makes more money, she has certain perks like government house. In that sense, even in show I am far more privileged than some women I got to see. She has her own bit of struggles though, as a single parent and as a woman.”  The Gangs of Wasseypur star was also extremely disheartened to see the effects of climate change while shooting for Candy. Asked about her experience of shooting in the Indian hill station of Nanital, Chadha says, “It did not snow as much as it was supposed to. In fact we had to go to Manali to shoot certain parts that required heavy snowfall. It is very disheartening to say this, but the effects of climate change were visible.” (The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/swetakaushal/2021/09/08/richa-chadha-on-effects-of-climate-change-candy-shoot-was-shifted-because-of-a-lack-of-snowfall/,Richa Chadha On Effects Of Climate Change: ‘Candy’ Shoot Was Shifted Because Of A Lack Of Snowfall
"A Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopter displaying a Taliban flag flies above Taliban supporters gathered ... [+] to celebrate the US withdrawal of all its troops out of Afghanistan, in Kandahar on September 1 following the Taliban's military takeover of the country.  Over the last month, the world watched as NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army collapsed to the Taliban. Among the numerous concerns this has raised, the many U.S. military vehicles left behind has loomed large. Indeed, the Taliban is now reported to have over 2,000 armored vehicles and up to 100 aircraft, including American UH-60 Black Hawks and Russian Mi-17s.  Initially, some argued that the vehicles would be useless to the Taliban due to a lack of experienced operators. This is not the case: A recent Taliban parade in Kandahar indicated that they have trained vehicle operators, including helicopter pilots. The Taliban’s expertise with American military equipment indicates that the Taliban have absorbed members of the Afghan National Army. Moreover, numerous agencies have asserted that the Taliban is getting support from other countries. This foreign support would allow the Taliban to have additional access to experienced vehicle operators and instructors.  While on the surface, this situation seems dire, these vehicles, even with trained operators, will offer little military value to the Taliban. In the end, this equipment set will end up like the graveyard of Soviet equipment abandoned throughout Afghanistan in 1989. It should be made clear that the United States did not gift the Afghan National Army the most cutting-edge equipment in the world. Indeed, the Taliban have been parading around in armored Humvees, a vehicle that the U.S. Army is moving away from due to the lack of protection from roadside bombs. Granted, the Taliban have showcased some rather new equipment captured during their rise to power, including Mine Resistant Ambush Protection vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, and intelligence-gathering drones. However, these vehicles had all been stripped of sensitive electronics prior to being gifted to the Afghan Army or left by NATO forces.

(Photo by Hoshang Hashimi / AFP) (Photo by HOSHANG HASHIMI/AFP via Getty Images) Moreover, there is a misalignment between these vehicle capabilities and the type of operations that the Taliban will engage in. They have spent the last week fighting in the Panjshir Valley, and despite claims to have captured the province, the fighting will likely continue. The steep slopes in the valley and the lack of roads makes the use of heavy military vehicles and helicopters a liability. Additionally, the fighters in Panjshir are familiar with the weaknesses in the vehicles and how to exploit them using roadside bombs and drones. Furthermore, these military vehicles require a substantial amount of maintenance, which the Taliban will likely not be able to provide even with foreign assistance. This maintenance of military vehicles requires technical expertise and access to specialized tools and spare parts. Prior to the Taliban takeover, the Afghan National Army leveraged contractor support for their technical expertise and American supply channels for the tools and spare parts. With the drawdown of NATO troops, many of these contractors opted to leave as well, resulting in many of the vehicles falling into a state of disrepair. Many analysts have blamed the poor state of their vehicles for the rapid collapse of the Afghan National Army.  A Taliban fighter (L) takes a picture of a damaged Afghan Air Forces MD 530 helicopter with his ...

(Photo by WAKIL KOHSAR / AFP) (Photo by WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images) The maintenance issue is further complicated by need for tools and spare parts. With many of these vehicles being American, it is unlikely that the Taliban will have access to these items. Even with access to the supply channels, the items are more likely to end up on the black market than in the maintenance bay. This was a common issue faced by the Afghan National Army and can be expected to be an issue for the Taliban. Given these maintenance challenges, it is unlikely that the Taliban will be able to keep these vehicles operational.  There is also a common complaint about the money wasted on this equipment. While some quote the cost as being $85 billion, the price tag is closer to $18 billion, spread out over almost 20 years. While still substantial, much of this equipment was originally sent over for use by NATO forces. Rather than spend to have the vehicles shipped out of Afghanistan, it was simply cheaper to refurbish them and gift them to the Afghan National Army.  TOPSHOT - Taliban fighters atop Humvee vehicles prepare before parading along a road to celebrate ...

"Left to right: Kishin RK, founder and CEO of RB Capital, Raj Kumar, chairman of Royal Holdings, ... [+] Rajit Sukumaran, managing director, Southeast Asia and Korea, IHG Hotels & Resorts, Serena Lim, vice president, development, Southeast Asia and Korea, IHG Hotels & Resorts.  RB Capital—controlled by Kishin RK and his father Raj Kumar—has picked IHG Hotels to manage its hotel in Farrer Park at the heart of Singapore’s Little India district, betting on a robust recovery in the tourism industry that was among the hardest hit by pandemic-induced travel restrictions.  Previously managed by Singapore-based Park Hotel Management, which is undergoing liquidation, the 300-room hotel has been rebranded as Holiday Inn Singapore Little India ahead of a renovation that will give it a fresh identity. “Holiday Inn Singapore Little India is supporting the Singapore government to keep borders safe, and we will start renovations in due course,” IHG said in an email reply to Forbes Asia. This will be the third Singapore hotel to be managed by IHG for RB Capital, which also owns the five-star InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay along the Singapore River and the 442-room Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay. The strategic collaboration across the three properties will enable greater synergies and shared expertise that will ensure that the hotels are better prepared for the recovery in the tourism industry, IHG said in a statement. “As Singapore prepares to embark on the endemic Covid-19 roadmap with the gradual opening its borders to international travel, I am confident that the hospitality industry will bounce back strongly,” Kishin, founder and CEO of RB Capital, said in a statement. “It’s the perfect time to relaunch this hotel with a new brand, new positioning and a design-led renovation so we are poised for recovery and ideally positioned to contribute to Singapore’s success as the country reopens.” The 20-story Holiday Inn Little India is part of Farrer Square, a mixed-use development built by RB Capital on a 99-year leasehold site that it bought in a state land auction in 2012. The project was completed in 2016.  The following year, RB Capital received an unsolicited proposal from an unidentified investor to buy the hotel but Kishin decided against the sale. “We believe in the long-term value appreciation of hotel plots in Singapore,” he told Forbes Asia by phone, adding that the replacement cost for such properties is extremely high. Directly connected to the Farrer Park MRT station, the property is strategically located just outside the central business district and close to the Orchard Road shopping belt. It is adjacent to the Farrer Park Hospital and the 24-hour shopping mall Mustafa Centre, which is popular among Indian tourists. The renovation of Holiday Inn Little India comes as several hotels in Singapore, including the Kwee family’s Capella Hotel Group and Pan Pacific Hotels, are refurbishing their properties to take advantage of the pandemic-induced downtime. Visitor arrivals slumped 86% to 2.7 million at the height of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020, dragging hotel revenues 71% lower to S$1.2 billion ($891 million), government data showed. While arrivals have picked up this year, the numbers are nowhere near the 2019 levels when more than 19 million visitors came to Singapore. “New attractions and infrastructure projects planned for 2021 to 2030 bode well for the future demand of tourism in Singapore,” Kishin said. “The Singapore government’s management of the Covid crisis with the lowest fatality count globally has gained the confidence and trust amongst corporations globally to explore this city as an attractive hub for themselves and their businesses.”  Kishin and his father Raj are among Singapore’s leading landlords with their Royal Holdings and RB Capital property empire. The duo have been on a dealmaking spree after a 2011 family settlement between Raj and his younger sibling Asok Kumar Hiranandani, also a billionaire. With a net worth of $2.7 billion, Kishin and Raj were ranked No. 14 when the list of Singapore’s 50 Richest people was published last month.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanburgos/2021/09/08/billionaire-family-extends-singapore-partnership-with-ihg-hotels-betting-on-tourism-recovery/,"Billionaire Family Extends Singapore Partnership With IHG Hotels, Betting On Tourism Recovery"

That’s because legal culture, education, indoctrination and language are different than other corporate business units. Lawyers have long operated by their own rules, timelines, and metrics—  even when they are corporate employees. They rationalize their detachment from business as necessary to maintain professional independence, freedom from economic conflict, and preservation of their ethical standards. This chimera sustains their fit-for-lawyer-purpose paradigm.   Lawyers have constructed and zealously maintained a cultural, intellectual, philosophical, regulatory, economic, and educational moat that separates them from other professions, business and society. Competition was thwarted, professional autonomy was absolute, supply was controlled (both numerically and geographically), clients were treated more as supplicants than customers, and terms of engagement were dictated by lawyers.  Law was a guild perpetuated by the myths of legal exceptionalism and bespoke work. The profession’s “lawyers and ‘non-lawyers’” mindset personified law’s hubris and insularity. Internal diversity and multidisciplinary collaboration were eschewed.  The legal profession defined “legal work,” and its practice became an end unto itself, not a means to achieve client objectives. Lawyers were the arbiters of their value and judges of their performance. Their purpose was to practice law.  That’s changing.  General Counsel Are On The Front Lines Of Legal Change General Counsel are in the vanguard of legal industry change. Most are not driving it but reacting to increasing pressure from the C-Suite that the legal function join in the enterprise digital transformation journey. That requires legal, among other things, to align with corporate purpose, create value, and contribute to an elevated end-to-end customer experience.  The legal department has long occupied a unique corporate position. It has been exempt from speaking the language of business; operating at its speed; adopting its processes, metrics, and fiscal accountability; and value creation. Most corporate legal departments maintained a detachment from other business functions—perhaps because they regarded themselves as professionals, not as a business function. Corporate legal departments typically operated as siloed, captive law firms embedded in the business but otherwise detached from it. Their small size, negligible budget impact, and “non-fee earner” role enabled them to operate as a discrete function within the enterprise. Digital transformation has changed that.  Digital transformation has altered legacy buy-sell paradigms and, in the process, fundamentally changed the way business operates internally and with its customers. Digital transformation is a team sport; multiple studies link digital success to cross-functional collaboration and data-sharing across the enterprise. Unsurprisingly, the legal function has been a digital laggard.  That is why the C-Suite is stepping in. The benefits of an agile, digital legal function extend far beyond its own internal efficiency and an ability to “do more with less.” A digital legal team can create significant enterprise value as well as improve customer (end-user) experience. The rewards for the agile, digital legal function mirror its impact on the enterprise. Legal has an opportunity to elevate its corporate standing, have a voice in corporate policy-making, and attract top talent in search of purpose-driven work and collaborative, innovative work environments.  The C-Suite Is Architecting A Fit-For-Business Purpose Legal Function. GC’s Are Tasked With Constructing It.   Business is the architect of a fit-for-business purpose digital legal function. The C-Suite is recasting law’s role and remit to align with corporate purpose and integrate with other business functions. The end game is enterprise value creation and an elevated customer experience.  General Counsel and their leadership teams are the general contractors overseeing the construction of a fit-for-business purpose legal function. It is not an easy assignment. GC’s confront a constellation of daunting challenges that include: downward pressure on budget, increasing workloads, widening portfolios, new risks, a talent war, and a dual role of proactive enterprise defender and value creator. Legal culture is the strongest headwind; there is enormous change resistance from most in their departments, large law firms, and legal institutions.  The 2021 EY Law Survey, conducted in collaboration with the Harvard Law School Center on the Legal Profession reveals the fiscal and operational challenges faced by corporate legal functions. Here is a sampling of the data:  ·     75% of GC’s are having difficulty handling current workloads; ·     The workload is projected to increase by 25% during the next 3 years; ·     88% of GC’s report plans to reduce their budgets in response to escalating pressure from the C-Suite and Board to do so; ·     Among large corporations (>$20B annual revenue), the C-Suite mandated legal cost takeout has jumped from 11% in 2019 to 18% in 2021. A recent study by The Digital Legal Exchange revealed the C-Suite’s changing legal remit is broader than financial and operational issues. The research found that 97% of business respondents said they wanted the legal function success metrics to be aligned with business goals. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of business respondents said it is important/extremely important for legal to create revenues and new market opportunities.  How can the legal function meet its formidable challenges? Short answer: not by preserving legacy legal industry paradigms. Legal-like business-must reimagine its purpose, role, and remit from the business and customer perspectives. This requires a long, hard look in the existential mirror and asking, “What purpose do we serve, what do our customers/end-users of our products and services need and expect from us, and how can we consistently exceed their expectations?” Most lawyers are not accustomed to posing these questions—business leaders are.  The technology, processes, models, data, resources, and capital exist to enable the legal function to meet its challenge and to turn it into opportunity. The legal function is not required to pioneer the digital journey; it can borrow from the experiences of its business colleagues who have already embarked on. These shared learnings will assist GC’s with the change management process. They will also kick-start the legal function’s transition from cost center to value creator by altering mindsets, automating and enabling legal professionals to focus on higher-value tasks, and promote integration with other business functions.  What Is Value Creation For Digital Businesses?  Value creation in the digital age is long-term and holistic. It involves not only profitability and satisfying shareholder expectations but also addressing the needs of customers, employees, and the supply chain. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment have also emerged as elements of value creation.  Value creation requires alignment of purpose—internally, across supply chains, and with customers. It is predicated upon trust, transparency, and a commitment to building a long-term relationship with employees, supply chain partners, and customers. It also involves a social compact with society and the planet to contribute to the common good and to be a better environmental stewards. These values create societal goodwill and a more positive view of the brand.  This is context for legal value creation. The process begins with a reassessment of  the legal function’s purpose from the client/customer and societal perspectives. This requires a paradigm shift from law’s insular, homogenous, self-selecting, zero-sum, individualistic, male-oriented, risk-averse, conservative, precedent-bound, mindset to one that more closely resembles its clients/customers and the broader society. Technology and data enable the digital transition; human behavior and adaptability realize it.  An Agile, Proactive Legal Function Creates Value  Legal functions that are agile and proactive create value. They do so in their enterprise defender and business collaborator (defense and offense) roles. They also create value in other ways—a heightened sense of purpose that spawns productivity and innovation; an improved employee experience that promotes talent retention/attraction and reduces turnover; and a culture that promotes diversity, teamwork, and customer-centricity.  A brief explanation of “agile” and “proactive” provides a framework for the cultural and mindset shift the legal industry must undertake to create value. Agile functions are customer-centric, fluid, cross-functional, innovative, fast learners (think: dot connectors), collaborative, outcome-driven, inquisitive, passionate learners-for-life. They function as a team and have a shared purpose. These are not buzzwords but core elements of a culture committed to creating value for individuals, the entire workforce, the enterprise, customers, and society.  Proactive functions utilize technology, data, multidisciplinary expertise, and other resources to detect, deflect, mitigate, and/or accelerate the process of extinguishing corporate risks. Those resources and methods can also be marshaled to identify, pursue, and capture market opportunities that create value. Value generation is created by proactive enterprise defense and business opportunity creation. This is the paradigm for legal value capture. Here are some examples.  1.   Legal teams capture value when they are internally integrated. Legal practice is leveraged and enhanced by synergy with those engaged in the business of delivering legal services (“legal operations”). Value is created by enhanced efficiency, cost reduction, speed, freeing up resources from low-value, high-volume, repetitive work. This creates a foundation for cross-functional activity (integration with other business units) that produces even greater value.   2.   Value is captured when the legal supply chain is integrated with the corporate legal department. To optimize value realization, the legal function must operate as a unified, integrated team throughout the supply chain. Lawyer-conceived, artificial distinctions between provider sources (in-house, law firm, law companies, consultancies, etc.) are a drag on value creation. Fluid, integrated teams that operate seamlessly, have a shared purpose, share data, integrate platforms, and deploy the right talent/tool for the appropriate task capture value.  3.   Legal teams capture value by working cross-functionally with other business units to solve enterprise challenges and to identify and pursue opportunities. This applies both to integration with other business units on corporate defense (compliance, cybersecurity, HR) as well as opportunity creation (sales, marketing, C-Suite). The more the legal function integrates with other business units across the enterprise, the greater the value creation potential.  4.   Agile, proactive teams produce efficiency/productivity gains (value creation) by early risk detection/dispute resolution. This frees up corporate and legal resources for core, value-generating activities instead of engaging them in protracted, counter-productive legal work. The same principles can be applied to other legal activities.  5.   Value capture is achieved by a customer-focused approach to key practice areas including litigation, commercial transactions, and compliance-the three largest legal spend and lost opportunity areas. This involves jettisoning existing paradigms developed by lawyers and replacing them with customer-centric approaches. Digital litigation, for example, focuses more on dispute avoidance and less on the inevitability of  protracted, invasive, costly, lost-opportunity filled, likely-to-settle-on-the-courthouse-steps legacy processes. When litigation cannot be avoided, the focus shifts to a compressed, accelerated, fact-gathering process and early case assessment and resolution. The same principles apply to contract management and compliance.  6.   Litigation finance offers another avenue for value capture. The third-party financial backing and tech and data-enabled case curation provides GC’s an opportunity to create value and enhance their relationship with CFO’s by monetizing legal rights without a significant outlay of capital. A recent Burford Capital Report found that 73% of financial officers report extremely/very extensive programs to return value to the business through affirmative litigation—but 46% report that these programs need improvement. The data demonstrates the new-found interest CFO’s are taking in the legal function and, more specifically, the different ways legal can create enterprise value.  Similar customer-focused paradigm shifts in contracts and compliance have produced value by fusing legal and other professional expertise expertise with  technology and data to identify risk as well as uncover opportunity. Value creation is enhanced when the agile, proactive legal function collaborates cross-functionally with other business units in risk detection as well as opportunity capture.  7.   Products. The legal function is sitting on a gold mine of unstructured data that has immense value that can be monetized. In 2016, AIG created the Legal Operations company to leverage its vast internal data base to help external clients reduce legal spend. More recently, Merck 
  
  MRK 
  and a handful of other large legal functions have created software that has been so successful in its internal use that it is sold to third-parties. This is further evidence of the untapped potential of legal departments to commercialize their expertise, data, and technology and market it as a product. AI-backed companies like Bryter whose no-code solutions help solve internal challenges that drive value as well as external products that enhance legal value creation.  Conclusion         A digitally fit-for-purpose legal function will elevate the profession, expand the role and impact of the legal function, create enterprise value, and improve the customer/end-user experience. Legal professionals who “have too much work to ‘go digital’” are writing their own epitaph. Those that see the challenges posed by legal change as opportunities, embrace new ways of working,  and learn new skills will reap the rewards of the digital legal function. So too will clients, customers, and society benefit from a fit-for-purpose digital legal function.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen1/2021/09/08/from-cost-center-to-value-creator-the-digitally-fit-for-purpose-legal-function/,From Cost Center To Value Creator: The Digitally Fit-For-Purpose Legal Function
"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - MARCH 19: Brendon Wakeham of the Bulldogs takes a conversion attempt during the ... [+] round 2 NRL match between the Canterbury Bulldogs and the North Queensland Cowboys at ANZ Stadium on March 19, 2020 in Sydney, Australia.Due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak, the fixture is the first top-level Sydney rugby league match played in 112 years where fans are locked out of the ground. This is due to a NSW Public Health Order prohibiting outdoor events with more than 500 people. (Photo by Matt King/Getty Images) While walking my dog around my locked down 5km radius of Sydney’s Inner West this week, I came across a discarded copy of Rugby League Week from March 2015 that someone had left out to be taken away.  Take it away I did, and, despite the magazine closing more than four years ago, I read my first ever copy of Rugby League Week.  It doesn’t seem an obvious place to start a discussion of the 2021 National Rugby League (NRL) season, but in terms of this column, in which the #NRLOutsider tries to pick apart accepted truisms in Australian rugby league, it is. This column has been dark for a few months, largely because of fatigue from writing about the postponement of the Rugby League World Cup, but also because it’s hard to write interesting, engaging content about the game when you don’t get to leave your gaff. What I have been doing in the interim period, like most league people, is watching, listening, reading, consuming and thinking about rugby league.  Not the game, because I’ve always done that and, frankly, could do that from anywhere, but the game, the ineffable rugby leagueiness of it all, the sense that the sport occupies a unique position both in popular culture and in Australian culture. After a year of trying to get to grips with what the NRL actually is and where it stands in the grand scheme of things, here are some observations. Call me the Nino Culotta of the north of England.  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - JUNE 13: Channel Nine commentators Peter Sterling and Phil Gould talk on camera ... [+] before the round 14 NRL match between the Sydney Roosters and the Penrith Panthers at Sydney Football Stadium on June 13, 2008 in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by Mark Nolan/Getty Images) The NRL media environment has no memory It’s strange to think of a media environment having a memory, but the discovery of an old Rugby League Week planted this idea in my mind. Once upon a time, print allowed news stories to breathe, for journalists to reflect and for people to think for a longer period of time about events. Now, in the 24 hour, fast turnover news cycle, there is no time for reflection. Obviously, this is not something limited to rugby league, but it is something that rugby league excels at. You find it in all areas where one sport dominates the media landscape: from Scottish football to Indian cricket to AFL, the need to shout loudest, be heard quickest and get your tweet shared is vital. The story leads on the Channel 9 News, bounces around social media, all the familiar faces - Phil Gould, Phil Rothfield, Paul Kent sat around a table on NRL 360 - chip in and that feeds the frenzy more, before it extinguishes itself and is replaced by something new.  The point isn’t to actually discuss what is happening to get anywhere, but to discuss it for discussing’s sake: this is where Gould, the master coach, and Rothfield and Kent, the seasoned journalists, become Gus, Buzz and Kenty, more like guys in the pub than the experts that they are.  There’s something uniquely Australian, to my mind, about being on first name terms with everyone in the game, and in reducing complexities to essentialisms.  The experts become characters and at worst, caricatures. As the comedian Stewart Lee used to say of Jeremy Clarkson’s controversialisms, he had them to a deadline in The Times. Again, this news cycle is far from unique to rugby league or to Sydney, but it is something that rugby league does not have to deal with elsewhere, and that the Sydney media environment is perfectly suited for.  Between March and October there is only one sport that matters, and the only news is local news, because we’re miles away from anything. Rugby league everywhere else in the world is at best second to football, and lives in a competing environment where it is one sport of many. Not here. PENRITH, AUSTRALIA - JUNE 18: Siosiua Taukeiaho of the Roosters is placed on report and sent to the ... [+] Sin Bin by referee Ashley Klein during the round 15 NRL match between the Penrith Panthers and the Sydney Roosters at Panthers Stadium, on June 18, 2021, in Penrith, Australia. (Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images) Australian rugby league can’t keep an idea in its head Naturally in a media environment like this, it follows that linear, well thought-out ideas get little time to flourish. When every conversation has to be a spray and every debate a stoush, reasoned argument is an innocent bystander and the idea of building a hypothesis and testing it against facts over time goes out of the window. This year might have been a vintage one for the two week outrage cycle, and but I doubt it. I think it’s always like this. Since March, we’ve had everyone getting injured, everyone getting sent off and every game being lop-sided; as well as the new rules, the old rules, the eligibility, the indiscretions, the expansion and the endless, endless, endless transfer rumors.  The high shot crackdown, which was the death of the game for a week in April, has apparently ended, but then people keep getting sent off.  The NRL sent off roughly one player a year before this season, if you’d forgotten when the lack of a crackdown looks like. As any sane person could have predicted (and as was exactly the point of the crackdown) players have generally gotten better at tackling lower. The refs took a bit of time to get used to it, but then they did and that was that.  The blowouts were A Big Thing, but at the end of the year, we seem to have decided that maybe some of the teams are just way better than others. Sure, the new rules might make that a bit more obvious, but the team that came fifth had a record that would have won them the comp in 2018 and the team that came eighth won just over 40% of their games.  That’s a lopsided league you’ve got there, so it’s understandable that lots of the games were mismatches. This was, to me at least, quite obvious in May or so, but that it wouldn’t have made as good telly to say that 70% of the league isn’t that good. Things that might actually matter for the sport barely get discussed at all. A whole World Cup was postponed and barely got a run on mainstream media. The NRLW was postponed with slightly more of a ripple, but still behind such pressing matters as that time a Bulldogs player got kicked out of a pub. Perhaps this is me being sentimental, but when print publications existed, you did get a lot more time to think about things. Australia’s rugby league ecosystem is relentlessly tabloid. I’ve said before that there appears to be a general assumption that, as a game, people don’t think that it is worth any effort thinking through, and that is certainly the impression you would get from the coverage. SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - MARCH 22: Wests Tigers fans look over their back fence on a temporary ... [+] scaffolding platform to Leichhardt Oval watching the round 2 NRL match between the Wests Tigers and the Newcastle Knights at Leichhardt Oval on March 22, 2020 in Sydney, Australia. Due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak fans have been locked out of NRL fixtures across all venues indefinitely. This is due to a NSW Public Health Order prohibiting outdoor events with more than 500 people. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) Rugby league is big time and that’s great It’s easy to get annoyed at the way that things that you love are portrayed, because you love them and want them to be the best that they can be. Almost every Aussie that I have spoken to about rugby league gripes about it, usually from a position of affection, with a shopping list of complaints ranging from the media issues I get annoyed about to their team (Wests Tigers fans) to the way the game is run. But take it from someone who grew up in the other heartland of the sport, in the north of England, where the sport is always in football’s shadow: living somewhere where rugby league is inescapable is brilliant. For those of us who call it The Greatest Game of All non-ironically, because it is actually the greatest sport on Earth, being in the place that cares the most about it is not to be sniffed at.  Origin, like it or not, genuinely stops the country. Everyone is in a tipping comp and talks about it around the office. You see people walking around in jerseys everywhere you go. The marketing, even when you know its marketing, is irresistibly good. Aussies might take these things as a given, but I don’t.  Absent-mindedly flicking through the channels last Sunday, I found that the Wallabies, Australia’s national team at rugby union, were playing the All Blacks, literally one of the most recognizable sporting teams on Earth, on a secondary channel while the main channel showed a game between a basket case, Wests Tigers, and the worst team in the NRL, the Canterbury Bulldogs.  Later, the excellent @FootyindustryAU Twitter reported that, in Sydney, 281,000 people watched an international rugby union game and 440,000 people watched two terrible rugby league teams play a meaningless fixture.  While it is, to paraphrase The Simpsons, easy to criticize (and fun too), it bears repeating that for all of the often poor quality of NRL coverage, there is so much of it about that there is always something good to be found.  In my time researching these articles, writing about the league and going out into the world (remember when that was allowed?) to report on the game, I have come across more engaged, passionate, and talented rugby league people than I can count. They exist in England, and in France, and around the world too, but not in such number and with such density. While the second half of the NRL season was something of a write off, the first half gave me more rugby league experiences than anyone could have hoped for.  The evening on the hill at Leichhardt Oval when the Tigers broke the Panthers’ streak—tell anyone there that night that it was Penrith’s reserve team and see how much they care. The Kaiviti Silktails, singing their victory hymn in the sheds with tears dripping down their faces.  The afternoons at the eighth wonder of the world, Henson Park, enjoying the game as a game, rather than a multimillion dollar business. Some of us even saw Russell Crowe smile from his box.  The NRL Outsider will return next season for more coverage of rugby league in Australia. In the meantime, he’ll be covering cricket and other sports over the Australian summer.

"More than 650,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 as of Wednesday, another jarring milestone in a pandemic that’s claimed more than 1,000 U.S. lives per day on average — but some states have sustained especially large death tolls: An average of more than 1,100 people in the U.S. have died each day since the nation's first ... [+] coronavirus death was reported in late February 2020  At least 650,532 Americans have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, averaging more than 1,100 deaths per day since the first coronavirus death was reported in late February 2020, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. New Jersey — which faced a brutal early surge of Covid-19 infections in spring 2020 — has the nation’s highest coronavirus death rate, totaling 303 fatalities per 100,000 residents since the start of the pandemic last year, according to CDC data. Mississippi has the second-highest death rate, at 291 per 100,000 people, a toll driven partly by a recent wave of infections that’s left Mississippi with the nation’s third-highest rate of new cases per day in the last week. New York has suffered 279 deaths per 100,000, the country’s third-highest rate, according to CDC total death counts and Census Bureau population figures — the death rate statistics published by the CDC list New York City (403 deaths per 100,000) separately from the rest of New York state (184). Another five states have death rates above 250 per 100,000 residents: Louisiana (273), Massachusetts (265), Arizona (261), Rhode Island (261) and Alabama (253). Some 15 other states have suffered more than 200 deaths per 100,000 residents, including larger states like Pennsylvania (221), Florida (218), Michigan (217), Georgia (217) and Illinois (210). Just seven states have total death rates below 100 per 100,000 residents, led by Hawaii (43) and Vermont (43), both of which imposed tight public health restrictions in early 2020 and currently have some of the nation’s highest Covid-19 vaccination rates. Other states with low overall death tolls include Alaska (59), Maine (70), Oregon (77), Utah (82) and Washington (87). The United States is still logging more than 1,400 new deaths per day on average, according to Johns Hopkins. Texas has the nation’s highest rate of new deaths (5.9 deaths per 100,000 in the last seven days), followed by Mississippi (5.4) and Arkansas (5.2), per the CDC. Meanwhile, 11 states reported less than one death per 100,000 in the last week: California (0.4), Rhode Island (0.4), North Dakota (0.5), Michigan (0.6), South Dakota (0.6), Maine (0.7), Minnesota (0.7), New Hampshire (0.7), Indiana (0.8), Massachusetts (0.8) and Missouri (0.8). The United States reported its first Covid-19 fatality more than 18 months ago: a man in his 50s from Washington state. Since then, the country has lost more lives to the disease than any other place on Earth, accounting for about 14% of the pandemic’s worldwide toll. The first wave of U.S. deaths came in spring 2020, a surge felt most acutely in northeastern states like New York and New Jersey, and fatalities ticked up again last summer and winter. Most recently, Covid-19 cases and deaths began spiking in July as the virus’ more contagious delta variant became dominant: Cases rose in all 50 states this summer, but some of the hardest-hit places have lower than average rates of Covid-19 vaccination. Seniors account for more than 78% of the United States’ total Covid-19 deaths, according to CDC figures. Possibly as a result, some 92.4% of U.S. seniors have taken at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, almost 20 points above the overall vaccination rate for eligible Americans. Many experts believe coronavirus deaths are significantly undercounted because not all cases are properly identified.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/08/us-just-surpassed-650000-covid-deaths-these-8-states-have-the-highest-fatality-rates/,"U.S. Just Surpassed 650,000 Covid Deaths—These 8 States Have The Highest Fatality Rates"
" Simone Biles of Team United States poses with the bronze medal from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Despite the pandemic, 2021 had an incredible summer of sport. Highlights included the Tokyo Olympics, Paralympics, The British & Irish Lions Tour of South Africa and The UEFA European Football Championship. Athletes from around the globe graced our screens, demonstrating feats of skill and strength.  While the world of business and sports don’t often directly overlap, there are plenty of similarities. Both involve intense competition to be the best in a specific field, as well as necessary teamwork and collaboration. So what business lessons can we learn from today’s sporting legends?   Marcus Rashford - Dedication 23 year old England football player, Marcus Rashford, is one of the best examples of a sportsman using their platform for social good.  During the pandemic, he continued and grew his campaign to tackle child food poverty. His open letter to the UK government was heartfelt and showed the issue was ""not about politics"" but about ""humanity"". Thanks to his efforts, the government made a U-turn on a previous statement. 1.3 million children were able to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays.  His level of involvement shows his commitment to the issue, personally visiting homeless shelters as well as leading huge fundraising drives. He has also faced his own personal challenges while supporting others, with racist abuse, which he has had to deal with his whole career, peaking after the Euro final.  Marcus Rashford is a shining example of a dedicated leader. His commitment to helping others has shown no signs of slowing. No matter the hurdle, he hasn’t stopped. And after each milestone is reached, his sights are set on what more could be done.  Simone Billes - Wellbeing The renowned American gymnast, Simone Billes, decided to withdraw from several finals at the Tokyo Olympics this year due to mental health concerns. The move led to some criticism, some from fans who wished to see the champion continue her winning streak, ​​​​having previously earned 19 World titles and five Olympic medals by the age of 24.  However, her decision was an important one and also garnered a lot of praise. It massively increased awareness of mental health issues, treating it in the same way that physical injuries are discussed. By speaking out, she has helped shine a light on the importance of the mental damage constant high-pressure situations can cause, and the risk they pose if not properly acknowledged.    Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers in his element  Kevin Love - Proactive Kevin Love, professional NBA star for the Cleveland Cavaliers, reacted quickly to the pandemic. Seeing the impact the sudden loss of jobs would have, on March 13th he donated $100,000 to the workers at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse. Since then, he has continued to support those affected by the pandemic.  Following this generous act, and speaking on the Today Show about the importance of providing support to those who need it, many other NBA players across the US followed suit. Twenty-one team owners in the following weeks also created funds as well as plans that assisted workers through the pandemic.  Kevin Love has also been extremely open about his long-term battle with anxiety and depression. Recognising the changing circumstances would mentally affect many,  he has spoken out about the importance of dealing with anxiety from the coronavirus pandemic in meaningful and helpful ways Kevin’s quick reaction to the dramatic change to those people’s lives that are often overlooked solidified his place as a modern leader, especially with so many following suit. Seeing the opportunity to step up and help others is something that business leaders can certainly aspire to.    Asma Elbadawi - Change “It only takes one person to create a movement.” A simple but perfect quote from the Sudanese-British basketball player and activist. Asma Elbadawi is the perfect example of acting and speaking with purpose, no matter what barriers are in your way.  She campaigned and won against the International Basketball Federation, removing a ban on hijabs and religious headwear in professional basketball. Taking on huge professional bodies can be a daunting task, one that she wouldn’t have been able to face without putting herself in an uncomfortable position. But driving for change, especially when the processes in place are unfair or need re-writing, can help both businesses and individuals alike work with purpose.  Usain Bolt celebrates winning the Men's 200m Final at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games    Usain Bolt - Motivation  For good reason, Usain Bolt is one of the greatest and most recognised athletes of all time. An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, and even after retiring in 2017, he still holds the world records for the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay. Staying at the top of his game for such a sustained period and across numerous track events took an extreme amount of motivation. Here’s how he did it.  Bolt has always shared his goals publically, showing he avoids self-doubt and has confidence in his ability to achieve them. He’s aware of the competition, knowing that if he didn’t keep improving, he would be overtaken. However, he never shied away from a competition, knowing his own specific strengths. Every single element of the above can be positively applied to business strategies in today’s world.  Alongside his incredible story, he is also one of the most likeable athletes out there. His personality always shines through, whether he’s chatting to the volunteers at the start line or doing his “lightning bolt” pose after crossing the finish line. Businesses need to learn that their customers care just as much about how a company interacts with them in a personal way as well as financial results.   There is a vast pool of sporting leaders, beyond those mentioned above, that we could all learn something from. Grit paired with a focus on the task at hand is a winning combination.

"At least 41 inmates were killed and 80 other inmates were injured on Wednesday morning after a massive fire broke out in a prison near the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, in what is the latest tragedy to hit the southeast Asian nation’s overcrowded prison system that has also been severely hit by Covid-19. Police and hospital officials store body bags of dead victims at a morgue in a local general ... [+] hospital in Tangerang after a prison fire broke out and killed 41 inmates. According to authorities, 80 inmates have been hospitalized, including eight with severe burns. The fire which broke out at the Tangerang prison, located 25 miles west of Jakarta, is believed to have been caused by a short circuit in the prison’s faulty electrical system, authorities noted. All 15 prison officers guarding the area are unhurt, officials added. According to the Associated Press, the prison was designed to house 1,225 inmates but had more than 2,000 people incarcerated there. Yasonna Laoly, the minister of law and human rights, visited the prison on Wednesday to inspect the damage. He said: “This is a tragedy that concerns all of us. We are working closely with all relevant parties to investigate the causes of the fire.” Overcrowding has become a common problem for prisons in Indonesia as they struggle with poor funding and a large influx of people arrested in the country’s ongoing war on drugs. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), Indonesia’s prisons hold roughly 270,000 inmates—which is more than double the system’s estimated capacity. Inmates across the country have dealt with Covid-19 outbreaks in several prisons. Last year, when the pandemic began, HRW reported that the prison system was ill-equipped to contain outbreaks and to care for sick prisoners.

"A 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Acapulco, Mexico late on Tuesday with tremors being felt more than 230 miles away in the capital, Mexico City, taking place exactly four years after a deadly quake resulted in 98 deaths across the country. A couple walks past a taxi cab that was damaged by falling debris after a strong earthquake in ... [+] Acapulco, Mexico. Authorities have so far reported one death, a man killed by a falling light post in a town northwest of Acapulco. Mexico’s National Seismological Service said the epicenter of the quake was 7 miles southeast of the port and resort city of Acapulco in Guerrero state. The agency initially announced a 6.9 magnitude quake had hit the area but then raised its estimate to 7.1. The intensity of the earthquake was severe enough to cause buildings and power lines to sway in Mexico City but no casualties have been reported from the national capital so far. In a statement, state-run power utility company CFE (Comision Federal de Electricidad) said 1.6 million people are left without power following the earthquake. Authorities across Mexico have noted the impact on infrastructure has been limited with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador stating in a televised address that there are “no serious damages.” Tuesday night’s earthquake comes exactly four years after a devastating 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck southern coast of Mexico and resulted in the deaths of 98 people. Just a few weeks later—on September 19, 2017—another major earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.1, hit central Mexico causing over 350 deaths including more than 200 fatalities in the capital Mexico City. Since then the southern coast of Mexico has witnessed two other quakes in the state of Oaxaca 2018 and 2020, which also resulted in several deaths. The country is accustomed to regular seismic activity as it is located next to an area where several sections of the earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, collide. Mexico has managed to somewhat limit the impact of the frequent seismic activity after a devastating quake in 1985, which resulted in at least 10,000 deaths in the capital, forced an overhauling of construction codes and installation of early warning systems. The New York Times reported that Mexico’s City’s early warning systems appear to have worked as intended on Tuesday night as speakers across the city blared sirens and spoken warnings of the quake several seconds before it happened.

"Containerized cargo is stacked high on a China Shipping Line freighter at Miami Beach, Florida. ... [+] (PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP via Getty Images) So far, the Biden administration’s trade policy has not been much different than the “America First” trade policy championed by Donald Trump. That may surprise some observers, given that economists viewed the Trump trade policy as imposing significant costs on consumers and businesses while unsuccessful in achieving its aims. To better understand the views of the business community on the Biden administration’s approach to trade, I interviewed John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Stuart Anderson: The Biden administration has launched a comprehensive review of U.S. trade policy and set the goal of making it “worker-centric.” What’s your impression of this approach to date? John Murphy: It’s early, but there’s both progress and frustration for the business community. The administration has pledged to restore “regular order” to trade policy by working more closely with Congress and the private sector, and there’s good dialogue today. U.S. Trade Representative Tai deserves kudos for ending the long-running U.S.-EU trade dispute over aircraft subsidies and rejecting unwarranted tariffs on imports from Vietnam.  As for that worker-centric approach, it’s evident in the outreach to organized labor. This has led the administration to focus on issues such as union organizing rights in Mexico, for example. From our perspective, though, the U.S. needs to get back on offense on trade: Other countries are charging ahead with their own trade negotiations while the U.S. has not entered into a major new market-opening trade agreement in a decade. Forty million American jobs depend on trade: A worker-centric trade policy should open markets for their exports. Anderson: Does business support this trade policy review? Murphy: Yes, but as a country we need to expedite it, and we shouldn’t get bogged down on questions that are pretty straightforward. There’s no reason the U.S. shouldn’t move ahead with the trade negotiations with the UK and Kenya, for example. Declaring we have to address domestic economic priorities first isn’t an answer: Trade is one of the best tools to strengthen our domestic economy. Anderson: What about the tariffs Biden inherited from Trump? Murphy: The business community’s frustration with the tariffs is growing. They’re costly, they cover hundreds of billions of dollars of imports, and they’re still there. American families and companies are paying these taxes, as they have from the beginning.  Take the steel tariffs: Steel prices have soared by more than 300% in the past year, and six million American workers are employed by manufacturers that use steel as a critical input. Turning the U.S. into an island of expensive steel puts America’s most innovative and fastest growing manufacturers at a disadvantage relative to their global competitors. And steel imported from allies in Europe, Japan or Korea presents no threat to U.S. national security, which is the focus of the Section 232 statute. Tariff relief is an urgent priority. Anderson: Were there costs to the Trump administration’s trade policy? Murphy: The Trump administration made tangible progress in select areas like digital trade, as we saw in a U.S.-Japan agreement and USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). The structural reform commitments in the U.S.-China trade deal represent tangible progress. But the repeated threats to withdraw from trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports imposed real costs. By 2019, the drag on investment was visible, FDI (foreign direct investment) declined and U.S. manufacturing fell into a recession; for agriculture, it would have been a depression absent government support. The reason folks don’t talk about it more today is the coronavirus pandemic hit and produced an even bigger disruption. We should learn from this record. Anderson: What are the Chamber’s priorities on trade policy in 2021 and 2022? Murphy: In addition to rebooting a market-opening trade agenda and untangling the tariffs, we want to establish the foundation of a trade policy that supports growth in tomorrow’s industries to ensure continued innovation, growth and job creation here at home. For example, the idea of negotiating a digital trade agreement with partners in the Asia-Pacific and elsewhere presents real opportunity. New digital trade tools are allowing huge numbers of small businesses to tap foreign markets. Services trade is now growing twice as fast as merchandise trade, thanks to digital tools. But protectionist barriers to digital trade are also spreading, so an agreement to keep the digital trade lanes open is important. It’s equally important to avoid self-inflicted wounds. The pursuit of an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines at the WTO (World Trade Organization) not only won’t help increase vaccine production—which is growing rapidly by any account—but threatens to divert limited supplies of critical inputs away from the facilities best prepared to manufacture these complex medicines. Creating industry partnerships is the path forward, not breaking patents. Anderson: What role would you like to see Congress play in trade policy? Murphy: The Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to regulate foreign trade and levy tariffs, and too much of this authority has been delegated to the executive. We strongly support legislation to ensure that Congress always has a say in the imposition of tariffs. And further down the road, we hope to see Trade Promotion Authority restored to ensure that Congress sets the priorities for trade negotiations and is consulted in trade talks. Anderson: What would be the Chamber of Commerce’s ideal trade policy for the United States? Murphy: A trade policy utopia . . . doesn’t utopia mean “a place that doesn’t exist”? But as an organization that represents businesses of every size, sector and state, we are leery of proposals that would impose costs on the many to advantage the few—and usually a well-connected few at that. This is too common in trade policy, across history and around the world. Historically, America has gotten this right much of the time, more than many other countries, and I’m optimistic we can do so in the future.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2021/09/08/chamber-of-commerce-frustrated-with-tariffs-but-sees-trade-progress/,Chamber Of Commerce Frustrated With Tariffs But Sees Trade Progress
"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 07: Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada reacts against Carlos Alcaraz of ... [+] Spain during his Men’s Singles quarterfinals match on Day Nine of the 2021 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 07, 2021 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) For the first time ever, no American men or women made the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open. But for our neighbors to the north, there is much rejoicing: Canada has two players in the semifinals. No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime joined Leylah Annie Fernandez in the semis after 18-year-old Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz retired with a leg injury down 6-3, 3-1 in a night quarterfinal in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Alcaraz was coming off back-to-back 5-set matches, including a titanic upset of No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in the third round, and said he had a “right adductor” issue that prevented him from continuing against Auger-Aliassime. He approached the net after the fourth game and the two embraced and shook hands. After Monday night’s play lasted until past 2 a.m. Tuesday morning, the Tuesday night matches were over by 10:20 p.m., much to the disappointment of the crowd. “It’s an amazing milestone, it’s been a fantastic tournament for me,” Auger-Aliassime, 21, told Brad Gilbert on court.  “Of course, it’s a weird ending today but in the end I’m through and I’ll have a chance on Friday to play against one of the best players in the world to have a chance to be in my first Grand Slam final. So it’s amazing, I’m happy I’m through and I’ll try to win the next one.” Fernandez will also play in her first major semifinal against No. 2 seed Aryna Sabalenka. The Montreal native who trains in Boca Raton, Fla., has already beaten four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, three-time Slam winner Angelique Kerber and world No. 5 Elina Svitolina. “I would say it’s the maple syrup,” she cracked when asked why the Canadians are doing so well.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Auger-Aliassime, who lost in the Wimbledon quarterfinals to eventual finalist Matteo Berrettini, will next face No. 2 Daniil Medvedev, who is through to his third straight U.S. Open semifinal after losing the 2019 final to Rafael Nadal and in the 2020 semifinals to Dominic Thiem. Medvedev is 1-0 against the Canadian, but their only match was back in 2018 on outdoor hardcourts in Canada. “Whoever wins gonna be on huge fire,” Medvedev said before he knew who he would be playing. “You know they are much younger than even me, even. I'm not old. “But for them it's going to be a first semis of a slam. You know, experience is not everything, because, for example, when I was in my first semis of a slam, I won it. Doesn't mean if you're there for the first time you're gonna lose it. “But I like that I have this experience. I know how is it. I'm not gonna be tight. I know that, yeah. After, it's a question about tennis. If I play good, it's going to be not easy for my opponent. That's the most important thing I'm gonna try to do.” Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, waves to the crowd after defeating Botic Van de Zandschulp, of the ... [+] Netherlands, during the quarterfinals of the US Open tennis championships, Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Auger-Aliassime said he might have to “mix things up” against the huge-hitting Russian, possibly by coming to net more often. Against Alcaraz, he was 11-of-15 at the net. “I have to mix things up, maybe come in,” he said. “Hopefully we put on a good show for you guys.” Medvedev is hungry for his first major title after losing to Nadal here in 2019 and then to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final in February. “I think Daniil will go in as a solid favorite,” John McEnroe said on ESPN. “That would be a big upset if Felix wins that.” The other semifinalists will be determined Wednesday when No. 4 Alexander Zverev takes on Lloyd Harris in the afternoon quarterfinal, and Djokovic meets Berrettini at night. Djokovic is seeking to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the Grand Slam. Auger-Aliassime, meantime, is into his first major semifinal and has an old hand as his coach: Toni Nadal, Rafael’s uncle and longtime coach who gave his blessing for his uncle to coach the Canadian. “It’s great to have Toni,” he said, adding that the two speak in French. “He’s a great coach, a great person, a great adding to my team this year. It’s great to have him here.  “The communication is good and the results are coming so it’s good.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/07/no-americans-made-the-us-open-quarterfinals-but-two-canadians-are-now-in-the-semifinals/,"No Americans Made The U.S. Open Quarterfinals, But Two Canadians Are Now In The Semifinals"
"Dexter Lumis and Indi Hartwell celebrated with Bachelor Parties at WWE NXT. WWE NXT advertised Dexter Lumis and Indi Hartwell bachelor parties, Ember Moon vs. Kay Lee Ray, Kacy Catanzaro and Kayden Carter vs. Io Shirai and Zoey Stark for the NXT Women’s Tag Team Championships and MSK vs. Imperium for the NXT Tag Team Championships.  Last week’s broadcast of WWE NXT garnered 717,000.        Ember Moon delivered a modified One-Winged Angel and, as a finisher, it might have been a superior version based on how quickly she was able to pull it off.  This match received modest “This is Awesome” chants, but deserved so much more.  Elektra Lopez established herself as the “powerhouse” of the group by body slamming Carmelo Hayes, who sold it like he had just been hit by a mack truck.  I’m not sure why Carmelo Hayes would be losing this early after winning a whole breakout tournament and being established as the No. 1 Contender for the North American Championship.  The Creed Brothers give me Steiner Brothers vibes, and their innovative double-team moved gave me AOP vibes. The Creed Brothers are the tag team version of Brock Lesnar.   The Creed Brothers might be good enough to save the Diamond Mine.  Ember Moon hinted toward a heel turn in a backstage promo.  It doesn’t get talked about enough, but Kayden Carter is really, really good.  Io Shirai refused to tag in for the first several moments of this match as she was determined to win this match by herself. Zoey Stark eventually tagged herself in.  Kacy Catanzaro and Kayden Carter were attacked by Mandy Rose, Gigi Dollin and Jacy Jayne, which makes no sense because it was Sarray who broke Mandy Rose’s face. Having said that, I smell a six-woman tag.  WWE NXT aired Bachelor and Bachelorette parties for Dexter Lumis and Indi Hartwell, and they ended with Lumis and Johnny Gargano on the same page.  I was wondering why NXT wouldn’t wait until next week’s live show to debut, and I think I have my answer in that maybe they were nervous of how fans would react to how short she was.  For all those months of hype, Mei Ying standing up was shorter than the Chucky doll.  Mei Ying vs. Abadon could be a fun dream match if WWE were ever to walk through the Forbidden Door.  I loved the fact that MSK issued this challenge because the former champions had to forfeit the NXT Tag Team Championships. Huge babyface move.  The heel Danny Burch surprisingly received “welcome back” chants, but those chants could have also applied to MSK, who haven’t wrestled since August 17.  There was nothing wrong with this match, but MSK has its best matches against other teams capable of high-flying like Legado Del Fantasma.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/07/wwe-nxt-results-winners-news-and-notes-on-september-7-2021/,"WWE NXT Results: Winners, News And Notes On September 7, 2021"
"Hours after the Taliban introduced the leaders of their interim government for Afghanistan on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it was “concerned” about the cabinet, which includes no women and at least one person on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s wanted terrorist list. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid addresses a press conference in Kabul on September 7, 2021. The United States is “concerned by the affiliations and track records” of some members of the hardline government unveiled by the Taliban on Tuesday, more than three weeks after the group took over Afghanistan’s capital city of Kabul, a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Forbes and several other news outlets. The State Department didn’t single out anyone by name, but the Taliban chose Sirajuddin Haqqani — a leader of the Haqqani network whom the FBI identified as a terrorist — to serve as interior minister, and several other leaders appear on U.N. sanction lists. The department also questioned the lack of female leaders appointed by the Taliban, and noted that the new government is dominated by existing Taliban members. The FBI currently lists a $10 million reward for information leading to the capture of Haqqani, after the Haqqani network — a U.S.-designated terrorist group founded by his late father — was blamed for multiple attacks in Afghanistan and tied to al-Qaeda. “We understand that the Taliban has presented this as a caretaker cabinet,” the State Department said. “However, we will judge the Taliban by its actions, not words. We have made clear our expectation that the Afghan people deserve an inclusive government.” The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan coincided with the U.S. military’s withdrawal after 20 years of fighting in the country. The group took over cities at a faster-than-expected clip as the U.S.-backed former Afghan government collapsed, and by mid-August, militants took control of Kabul for the first time in two decades. The Taliban promised to form an inclusive government, respect women’s rights and offer amnesty to Afghans who worked for U.S. forces, but many Afghans feared a return to the group’s brutal reign from 1996 to 2001, when women were largely barred from school and people who violated the group’s fundamentalist rules faced harsh punishment. Almost immediately after the group took over Afghanistan, reports emerged of Taliban members ordering women to leave work and engaging in menacing door-to-door searches for Afghans who collaborated with the former government and U.S. military, and two weeks ago, a spokesperson for the Taliban asked women to stay at home temporarily, claiming its fighters still needed to be trained to respect women. The Biden administration says it still hopes to evacuate roughly 100 U.S. citizens who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave the country, and an unknown number of Afghans who worked for the United States and fear Taliban reprisal are still in the country. Allowing these evacuees to leave will likely require cooperation from the Taliban. The State Department said Tuesday it will “hold the Taliban to their commitments to allow safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans with travel documents.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/07/us-worried-about-members-of-new-taliban-cabinet---which-includes-minister-on-fbi-wanted-list/,U.S. Worried About Members Of New Taliban Cabinet — Which Includes Minister On FBI Wanted List

[+] Stanley Mosk Courthouse on Oct. 24, 2012, in Los Angeles and Britney Spears at the Clive Davis and The Recording Academy Pre-Grammy Gala on Feb. 11, 2017, in Beverly Hills, Calif. Britney Spears' father has filed to end the court conservatorship that has controlled the singer's life and money for 13 years. James Spears filed his petition to end the conservatorship in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021. (AP Photo/File) In the filing in Los Angeles Superior Court, Jamie Spears said the pop star’s circumstances have changed to the extent that “grounds for establishment of a conservatorship may no longer exist,” according to NBC News.  Spears also said in the petition that his daughter wants “control of her life back without the safety rails of a conservatorship,” and that she wants to make her own decisions regarding medical care, therapy and whether to get married and have more children, according to CNN. The petition also argued that under probate code, a psychological evaluation wouldn’t be required to allow Spears to terminate the conservatorship, NBC reports. Judge Brenda Penny, who is overseeing Spears’ case, will decide whether to end the conservatorship. Britney Spears’ lawyer Mathew Rosengart said in a statement to Forbes that the filing is a “massive victory” and “vindication” for the singer, but that their investigation “into financial mismanagement and other issues will continue.” Forbes has reached out to Jamie Spears’ representation for comment. The court filing comes a few weeks ahead of Spears’ next conservatorship hearing, which was scheduled for Sept. 29. Last month Spears’ father agreed to step down as conservator, but he did not give any indication that he would seek to end Spears’ conservatorship. Spears’ lawyer Mathew Rosengart previously filed a petition to speed up the process to remove Spears’ father and replace him with California certified public accountant Jason Rubin. Britney Spears has been under a conservatorship since 2008, following a series of public mental health struggles. She began to speak out publicly against the arrangement earlier this year, starting with a virtual court appearance in June where she called it “abusive.” She said her conservators forced her to work nonstop against her will and forced her to take medications like lithium. She also said she wanted to get married and start a family, but was not allowed to go to the doctor to get her IUD removed, saying, “this conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good.”  Jamie Spears said in an August filing that he would step down and help with the transition to a new court-appointed conservator to avoid a “public feud“ with the pop star. His legal team argued that Spears’ only stepped into the role of conservator in 2008 because his daughter “was desperately in need of help.” The filing also said that the conservatorship “saved Ms. Spears from disaster, supported her when she needed it the most, protected her and her reputation from harm, and facilitated the restoration of her career.""

"Lawyers representing embattled Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes have submitted a list of dozens of witnesses who could be called to testify in her defense at her trial beginning Wednesday, adding numerous high-profile board members, former employees and even the journalist who sparked her downfall to an already star-studded roster of potential witnesses outlined by the prosecution.  Elizabeth Holmes, founder and former CEO of Theranos, arrives for motion hearing on Monday, November ... [+] 4, 2019, at the U.S. District Court House inside Robert F. Peckham Federal Building in San Jose, California. (Photo by Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Holmes’ team submitted over 50 names, including 12 that were redacted, in a filing late Tuesday, emphasizing that the list may be supplemented depending on what happens at the trial.  Among those who could be called to the witness stand is Holmes herself, who is maintaining the option to plead her own innocence to the jury.  Also on the list of potential witnesses are multiple people tied to her defunct company, including former employees involved in making Theranos’ products and powerful figures who served on Theranos’ board, such as former CDC Director William Foege, former Senate Majority Leader William Frist and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.  Riley Bechtel, a construction billionaire who pumped over $6 million into Theranos, is also on the preliminary list, alongside Sue Desmond-Hellman, the former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, though her connection to Holmes is not immediately clear.  Holmes’ defense team has tapped numerous members of the federal health bodies that reviewed Theranos’ technology to possibly testify at trial as well, such as former Food and Drug Administration head Alberto Gutierrez.  Some of the more surprising names on the list are three of the prosecutors leading the case against Holmes and the former Wall Street Journal reporter who penned the 2015 articles that first raised doubts about Theranos’ technology.  “[The] strategy seems clear,” said the ex-WSJ journalist, John Carreyrou, who has also produced a podcast and written a book about Holmes’ case, of the defense team’s selections. “They’re going to argue to the jury that this was a witch hunt.”  The potential witnesses highlighted by the defense compound those already named by the prosecution, whom Holmes’ legal team may also choose to call on. The prosecution’s list, which was over 200 people long, included other Theranos-linked power players like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, one of the company’s board members, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.  Opening statements begin Wednesday in Holmes’ trial, which is expected to last between three and four months total.  Holmes, now 37 years old, faces a total of 12 charges—two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 10 counts of wire fraud—for allegedly engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to deceive investors, doctors and patients from 2010 to 2016 alongside Theranos’ former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with whom she was romantically involved. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and hit with a $250,000 fine, in addition to restitution, for each count. Holmes and Balwani have both pleaded not guilty and are standing trial separately (Balwani’s trial is set to begin January 2022).  Holmes skyrocketed to fame nearly a decade ago and was hailed as a visionary for Theranos, a company she founded at age 19 while she was still a student at Stanford University. Setting the lofty goal of revolutionizing healthcare, Holmes said she had the technology to create blood tests that would be able to run hundreds of diagnostics on diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes using just a small drop of patients’ blood. She attracted a litany of high-profile investors who pumped more than $700 million into the company and also struck partnerships with Walgreens, Cleveland Clinic, Capital BlueCross and more from 2013 to 2015. A media darling, she appeared on the covers of most major magazines and was declared America’s youngest self-made female billionaire by Forbes in 2015 after Theranos was valued at $9 billion. The momentum was abruptly broken later that year when the Wall Street Journal published a series of investigations calling into question the effectiveness of Theranos’ blood testing machines, which it discovered were giving patients incorrect diagnoses. This catalyzed a fall from grace that led to the dissolution of the business in September 2018 and Holmes’ estimated net worth falling to $0, according to Forbes.  “Elizabeth Holmes’ Trial Starts This Week—Here’s What To Know About Her Charges, Defense Strategy And More” (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/07/board-members-billionaires-and-a-journalist-heres-who-elizabeth-holmes-lawyers-could-call-to-testify/,"Board Members, Billionaires And A Journalist: Here’s Who Elizabeth Holmes’ Lawyers Could Call To Testify"
"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - AUGUST 27: Stray Kids attends 2019 Soribada Best K-Music Awards at Olympic Park ... [+] KSPO DOME in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images) Stray Kids are already one of the biggest and most successful musical acts in their home country of South Korea, and with each new release, they also reach larger and larger audiences all around the world. Their latest full-length became an instant No. 1 on the local albums ranking, but it’s on the Gaon Download chart, the list of the bestselling individual tunes in the nation, where the band really demonstrates their incredible popularity. All 14 songs featured on Stray Kids’ new album Noeasy don’t just appear on the 200-spot Gaon Download chart, but manage to find space inside the top 40. It’s not entirely uncommon for the entire tracklists of the most popular EPs and albums of the day to appear on the sales-only list, but more than a dozen placements inside the upper quarter of the tally is a feat reserved for only the biggest stars in the South Korean music industry. Stray Kids almost nabbed the bestselling song in South Korea this week with their new single “Thunderous,” but the track misses the highest rung by just one space, instead settling for the runner-up spot. The hit comes in behind Lee Chan Won’s “Convenience,” which debuts in first place. While Noeasy and all of its songs are bestsellers, Stray Kids only occupy one spot inside the top 10 this frame. Just two other tunes appear within the top 20, with “Domino” launching at No. 17 while “Cheese” kicks off its time on the tally at No. 19. Between No. 21 and No. 34, Stray Kids fill 11 of the 14 available spaces, dominating the region with a slew of brand new releases.

"Rod Roddenberry, CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment, continues to build on his father Gene ... [+] Roddenberry’s work and family legacy. At 55, Star Trek has never looked fresher or had a brighter future. The very first episode of the original TV series aired on NBC on September 8, 1966. Meanwhile, the four original Star Trek movies have been remastered and released on 4K UHD to mark the landmark anniversary. “It brings them back to life,” enthused Rod Rodenberry, the CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment. “These movies start to look dated after a while, and when they can go back to the original footage, and they’re able to rescan it, recomposite it and update effects that are in there, it gives it a whole new lease of life.” Collectively, the four original Star Trek films grossed $456 million at the box office, not adjusted for inflation. Over the last half-century, Star Trek has grown to become a multibillion-dollar brand and franchise that has given audiences multiple spin-off TV series, a string of movies, and everything from video games to theme park and tourist attractions.  For Roddenberry, refreshing the original films is a vital part of Star Trek’s longevity. He explained, “I think it makes Star Trek new again, especially for our new audiences. You’ve got the TV series now that has brought in a newer, younger demographic, and I think some people are resistant to look at older stuff. When it comes out in 4K, it looks fresh and new. I’m excited by them being introduced to Star Trek through the original movies.” Now in the Captain’s chair of the whole enterprise, Roddenberry is immersed deep in the lore and the world his father, the legendary Gene Roddenberry, created. That was not always the case, but he’s grateful that he found his way to it. “I think that does help on some level. I never sought out Star Trek initially. I was a Star Wars fan, and I watched Knight Rider and Starsky and Hutch. It took me a while. I did enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation, but I would say I didn’t really get it,” he recalled. “It was the fans who taught me Star Trek. After my father passed away, I had fans constantly coming up to say how Star Trek inspired them. Whether it was an abusive relationship or a handicap or whatever the case may be, they would tell these stories and say it gave them a belief that we would be a society where we’re accepting of each other one day. It blew me away because Knight Rider never did that for me.”  “So, back I went, I rewatched Star Trek, and the more times I did, the more I was able to see what they were talking about. I feel like I got Star Trek from the backward way in. I didn’t watch it because it was sci-fi. I watched because fans said it meant something, and I started to enjoy it from that perspective.” (Left to right) DeForest Kelley, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy on the set of 'Star Trek: The ... [+] Wrath of Khan.' Even his connection with the original films was something that he grew into. “I was very young at the time,” Roddenberry revealed. “I think I was on the Klingon bridge for Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. I believe I was around 12-years-old at the time. I thought it was cool to be there, but I was still at the age where I didn’t really comprehend and understand Star Trek. It wasn’t until Star Trek: The Next Generation when I was still very young, but I was working as a PA on the show and then Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and that’s where I started to appreciate it a little bit more. That’s when I began to love it.” It is Star Trek’s universal appeal that the CEO credits for the continued love for what his father created. “It is interesting to hear the different reasons about why people like Star Trek. There is always a commonality of loving a united future with us all coming together, no longer fearing difference and change,” Roddenberry mused. “I did a documentary called Trek Nation back in 2012, and I got to talk to people from all walks of life, whether they’re luminaries in the industry, NFL stars, religious leaders, from all over the world. Even if they looked at it slightly differently or came to it from a slightly different point of view, it was great that people all said, ‘Yeah, but one day, we’re all going to be living and working together.’ That’s the beauty of Star Trek for me.” While Roddenberry is excited about the anniversary and the reissuing of the original movies, like Star Trek itself, he’s looking to the future with excitement and wonder as it explores new worlds of content. “My father did an interview which I loved, and it showed my father as a fairly humble person,” he recalled. “He talked about how one day he hoped that some talented young producer-writer would come along, take the characters and the world, and reenvision it. They would show that new audience what Star Trek can be, and audience members are saying, ‘Wow, that’s better than the original Star Trek.’ I love the fact that he wanted Star Trek to live on. He wants people like J.J. Abrams and Alex Kurtzman and others to come along and do that. He also wanted to make sure that it remains Star Trek. Throughout the years, there were many arguments that he had with writers and producers and directors about our characters, not in the end, conducting themselves as ethical, empathetic human beings that go by this Starfleet doctrine.” Producer and CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment, Eugene ""Rod"" Roddenberry Jr., speaks during the 14th ... [+] annual official Star Trek convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.  But how does Roddenberry feel about that much-discussed take on Trek from filmmaker Quentin Tarantino? “I struggle with that because the way I’m pretty myopic with the way I see Star Trek,” the CEO said. “I mentioned that I grew up with fans coming up to me out saying how Star Trek inspired them and gave them hope for the future. It’s the optimism and the messaging in there that make Star Trek what it was. I truly believe that. If you create a Star Trek, that is just action; that is not Star Trek, in my opinion. That’s what makes it different than Star Wars, and I love Star Wars, but they can both coexist. And I love Tarantino’s work and the kind of films that he does. I am trying to have an open mind.” “I would be curious to read a script on his take. I do not think you could say we’re going to do a Reservoir Dogs Star Trek. I’ll be honest, that doesn’t work for me, but he is a fan, and I think as a fan, he probably understands to some degree that Star Trek has to have some of this messaging. I would be curious, and I would try to have an open mind, but I’m not sure what it would be. I am glad that people are willing to explore that at least.” With the release of the remastered four original Star Trek movies on 4K UHD, and the franchise continuing to find new ways to tell stories on the big screen and the small, Roddenberry is inspired by the opportunities seized and created by another multibillion-dollar brand and franchise, Marvel. “Everything evolves and changes, and the entertainment industry is a great example of that,” he concluded. “20 or 30 years ago, if you went and pitched an animated series or an episodic or saga that went over many seasons, there would be a lot of fear and aversion to something like that. We know we can do that now. Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+ and all those other platforms, and different formats of shows and how you consume them have opened up the market for us and others, and I love it. I think there were a few articles that I read many years ago about Marvelizing Star Trek because you’ve got a universe and tons of characters. You could do a series about Romulans or Klingons, and I love that the new creatives are embracing that. They truly are.”  “I think it’s also incredibly intelligent to have an animated series, a darker series set 800 years in the future, to visit some of the classics with Picard, and now maybe change the format and go back to an original series format with strange new worlds. I love the diversity in the types of Star Trek that are out there. As long as they are continuing the tradition and the idea of it making you think. Having it entertain is extremely important, absolutely, but let’s be considering different points of view on this as well.” Star Trek: The Original 4 Movie Collection is available on 4K Ultra HD and Blu-Ray now.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2021/09/07/star-trek-ceo-celebrates-55-years-of-the-franchise-and-looks-to-the-future/,‘Star Trek’ CEO Celebrates 55 Years Of The Franchise And Looks To The Future
"INDIO, CA - APRIL 15: Drake performs on the Coachella stage during day 2 of the Coachella Valley ... [+] Music And Arts Festival (Weekend 1) at the Empire Polo Club on April 15, 2017 in Indio, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella) As anticipated, Kanye West scored the biggest debut of 2021 with his new Billboard 200-topping album Donda. But the Chicago rapper won’t hold the title for long, as Drake’s Certified Lover Boy is headed for the biggest debut of 2021 by a huge margin, smashing a myriad of streaming records along the way. The Toronto native’s new full-length is on track to move north of 600,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, HITS Daily Double reports. It will give Drake the biggest debut since Taylor Swift’s Folklore opened with 846,000 units last August, and it will roughly double the first-week numbers of West’s Donda, which opened with 309,000 units. Certified Lover Boy could earn between 680 and 700 million streams by the time this week is through. It would fall slightly short of the first-week streaming record held by Drake’s own Scorpion (745.92 million), but it will still smash the 2021 record currently held by Donda (357.39 million).  Drake’s latest project has already obliterated a slew of other streaming records. It racked up 153 million global Spotify streams in its first day, notching the biggest 24-hour debut in the platform’s history, surpassing yet another record previously held by Scorpion (132 million). Certified Lover Boy also earned a record 80.4 million first-day U.S. streams, outperforming Scorpion by just 1.2 million, according to HITS Daily Double. And lest anyone think the album only performed well on Spotify, Chart Data also reports that Certified Lover Boy broke Apple Music’s single-day streaming record for an album. Naturally, the individual tracks on Certified Lover Boy have also gotten off to historic starts. The Lil Baby-assisted “Girls Want Girls” earned the biggest global Spotify debut ever with 12.4 million streams, surpassing the former record holder, BTS’s “Butter,” by roughly 1.4 million. (Keep in mind that “Butter” logged 20.9 million first-day streams on the Spotify counter but had nearly half of them filtered.) Drake also notched the second- and third-biggest global Spotify song debuts with “Champagne Poetry” (11.7 million) and “Fair Trade” (11.6 million). Certified Lover Boy fared equally well stateside, occupying the top 21 slots on the U.S. Spotify chart on Friday. (Much like the 27-track Donda, Certified Lover Boy is a Herculean album that’s engineered for streaming dominance, clocking in at 86 minutes across 21 songs.) ""Girls Want Girls"" broke the single-day U.S. streaming record with 6.146 million streams, just barely eclipsing Olivia Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License” (6.145 million streams).  These mammoth streaming figures will result in a splashy Hot 100 debut for Certified Lover Boy. The rapper could break his own record for the most songs in the Hot 100’s Top 10 simultaneously, which he previously set in 2018 when seven Scorpion songs occupied the Top 10 in the same week, breaking the Beatles’ record of five, which they had held since 1964. However the Billboard charts shake out next week, Certified Lover Boy is already a certified smash.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2021/09/07/drakes-certified-lover-boy-smashes-spotify-records-as-it-heads-for-biggest-debut-of-2021/,Drake’s ‘Certified Lover Boy’ Smashes Spotify Records As It Heads For Biggest Debut Of 2021
"More moviegoers went to the theaters this past Labor Day weekend than in 2019 following the release of Shang-Chi, theater chains said Tuesday, marking the first time attendance has surpassed pre-coronavirus-pandemic numbers, and giving movie theaters hope for a revenue turnaround at the box office after a lackluster year. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 05: Moviegoers line up at AMC Lincoln Square 13 on March 05, 2021 in New ... [+] York City. AMC Theatres reopened its New York area locations today, with new safety precautions in place, for the first time since closing in March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (Photo by Noam Galai/WireImage) AMC Theaters said more than two million people watched a movie at one of its more than 380 U.S. AMC theaters between September 2 and September 5, beating out its previous Labor Day revenue record in 2013. The company also noted that over the Labor Day weekend, movie theater attendance eclipsed that of the same weekend in 2019, the first time that has happened since the pandemic began. Cinemark, which has 323 movie theaters across the U.S., told Forbes it also welcomed nearly two million people to its movie theaters over the 4-day Labor Day weekend, exceeding 2019’s Labor Day weekend attendance levels. The tide of moviegoers is largely attributed by the theater chains to the release of Shang-Chi, which according to Deadline, made a 4-day total of over $94 million, and recorded the best Monday movie theater box office numbers since the pandemic began. The two other large movie theater chains in the U.S., Regal Cinemas and Cineworld, did not immediately respond to Forbes for a comment. The better than expected Labor Day weekend box office marks another step toward recovery for movie theater chains. In the first quarter of this year, Cinemark posted a revenue loss of $208.8 million, according to The Wrap, while AMC had a $567 million net loss during the same quarter. However, the movie theater chains saw some recovery during the second quarter, with both companies exceeding Wall Street analyst revenue estimates. Cinemark, which reopened all of its U.S. theaters by June 30, had a $9 million increase in revenue compared to the same quarter in 2020. AMC saw a 7 million bump in movie theater attendance from the first quarter of this year and posted over $440 million revenue in its second quarter, higher than the expected $382 million. This marks good news for movie theater chains, which have had to deal with movie delays including Top Gun: Maverick, the latest Mission Impossible movie and John Wick: Chapter 4, and movies moving from the box office to stream exclusively online like Transylvania: Transformania. Over the Labor Day weekend, Asian-American groups in places like the Bay area organized theater buyouts for Shangi-Chi, in which they bought out all the tickets available for movie screenings and gave them out to community members. Asian and Pacific Islander non-profit Gold House also worked with GoFundMe to provide funds to help communities organize screenings to watch Shang-Chi, raising over $36,000.

[+] Seoul on September 1, 2020. - K-pop sensation BTS has become the first all-South Korean act to rule the top US singles chart, industry tracker Billboard announced on August 31, with their English-language ""Dynamite"" hitting number one. (Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) BTS are back at No. 1 on this week’s Hot 100 with their unstoppable smash “Butter,” which vaults from No. 7 to the throne after the South Korean vocal re-released the newly-crowned Song of the Summer with rapper Megan Thee Stallion on board. The updated tune has now racked up 10 frames atop the most competitive singles list in the U.S., and with one more turn on the tally guaranteed, the cut makes history in yet another fashion. When Billboard refreshes the Hot 100 in its entirety tomorrow (Wednesday, September 8), “Butter” will earn its fifteenth stay on the chart. That’s not a terribly long tenure for most mega hits, but when looking solely at those songs performed and released by musicians from South Korea, it is a very impressive residency. With 15 weeks spent on the Hot 100, “Butter” ties as the fourth-longest-charting song by a South Korean musical act. As of tomorrow, the tune will be on the same level as Psy’s “Gentleman,” which departed the ranking after 15 frames. That cut became the K-pop musician’s second top 10 on the roster back in 2013 when it peaked at No. 5. Earlier this year, BTS broke the all-time record for the longest-charting song by a South Korean musical act with their globe-dominating tune “Dynamite.” That track, which debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the first of five leaders (so far) for the band, lived on the chart for a record-setting 32 turns, vacating the tally in 2021.  “Dynamite” beat the previous record holder, Psy’s “Gangnam Style,” by just one week. That smash, which became the first top 10 hit by a South Korean musician in U.S. history when it stalled one rung shy of running the show back in 2012, managed 31 frames on the list. The third-longest-running Hot 100 hit by a South Korean musical act is “Baby Shark” by Pinkfong, which can be described as something of a band/brand hybrid. The earworm only rose as high as No. 32, but it has remained a viral sensation for years, and though it disappeared from the chart after 20 weeks, it still performs extremely well on platforms like YouTube and Spotify to this day. On next week’s Hot 100, “Butter” will likely not only vacate the No. 1 spot, but perhaps the top 10 entirely. Drake is set to invade the ranking with songs from his new album Certified Lover Boy, and those immediate successes will push everything else out of the way. BTS’s current smash will probably manage to hold on and appear on the chart again, and in doing so, it will break its tie with “Gentleman,” standing alone as the fourth-longest-charting song by a South Korean act.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/07/as-bts-hit-no-1-on-the-hot-100-again-the-band-ties-psy-with-a-historically-stable-smash/,"As BTS Hit No. 1 On The Hot 100 (Again), The Band Ties Psy With A Historically Stable Smash"
"Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, returns a shot to Elina Svitolina, of Ukraine, during the quarterfinals ... [+] of the US Open tennis championships, Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) After hitting a forehand winner to earn a break in the decisive third set, Leylah Annie Fernandez raised her right fist to the raucous Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd and then lifted her hands above her head to encourage even more noise. The crowd obliged with a sonic boom of cheers. Fernandez, who turned 19 years old on Monday, is celebrating her birthday week in style. After never having gone past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, the Montreal native who trains in Boynton Beach, Fla., is now through to the U.S. Open semifinals after a stunning 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(5) victory over No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina on Tuesday. She will next face world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka, who roared past Roland Garros champion and No. 18 seed Barbora Krejcikova, 6-1, 6-4. Fernandez is the youngest semifinalist since an 18-year-old Maria Sharapova in 2005. Fernandez had earned about $374,000 in 2021 entering the U.S. Open and will now take home $675,000 for making the semifinals and stands to make as much as $2.5 million if she goes on to win the title. “I honestly have no idea what I’m feeling right now,” she told Rennae Stubbs on court after the victory. “I was so nervous and I was trying to do what my coach [her father Jorge Fernandez] told me to do and thanks to you guys, to the crowd, to the New York crowd, I was able to push through today.” The charismatic, confident left-hander has now beaten four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, three-time major champion Angelique Kerber and world No. 5 Svitolina in succession — coming from a set and a break down in the victories over Osaka and Kerber. She is the youngest woman since a 17-year-old Serena Williams in 1999 to beat two top-5 players at a major.

Raducanu will play her quarterfinal Wednesday against Olympic gold medalist Belinda Bencic, while Alcaraz, dubbed the heir apparent to Rafael Nadal, was set to play Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime later Tuesday night. If Auger-Aliassime wins, Canada would have two players in the semifinals after Canadian Denis Shapovalov reached the Wimbledon semifinals. “I would say it’s the maple syrup,” she cracked when asked why the Canadians are doing so well.

They’ve really embraced it. “It’s been awesome to watch them stepping up to the plate on the big stage, delivering great tennis and great entertainment and great sportsmanship as well. It’s been an amazing week for tennis.” Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, reacts after scoring a point against Elina Svitolina, of Ukraine, ...

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Serving for the match at 5-3, Fernandez faced a break point and Svitolina took advantage with a deep approach shot and then an overhead smash to close to within 4-5. In the tiebreak, Fernandez earned a mini-break at 2-1 with a forehand return winner. At 5-all in the breaker, Fernandez hit a running forehand passing shot that clipped the net and landed in, giving her a match point. On match point, Svitolina hit the return long and Fernandez bent down to the ground on the baseline before Svitolina came across to embrace her. Fernandez’s coach and father, Jorge Fernandez, did not travel from Florida to New York reportedly because he’s superstitious. “(I feel) just sheer happiness father,” he told CBS12 in Florida. ""Not too many people can live out their dreams and she's living them out as we speak, and she's actually extremely aware that these are the beginning steps of eventually a very fruitful career if she keeps this up.” Said Leylah after her latest win: “My dad told me so many things but today he told me to go out there, have fun, fight for every point. Today’s your first quarterfinals, don’t make it your last. Fight for your dream.” While virtually no one thought Fernandez could make a run to the semifinals, apparently she did. Asked after her victory over defending champion Osaka when she knew she could win the match, she said: “From the very beginning, right before the match, I knew I was able to win.” Serena Williams may not be here but Fernandez is doing things not seen since Serena burst onto the scene more than two decades ago.

"BUB 2021 This story is part of Forbes' coverage of Asia's Best Under A Billion 2021 list, which highlights 200 Asia-Pacific public companies with less than $1 billion in revenue and consistent top- and bottom-line growth. See the full list, sorted alphabetically, here. Despite the global spread of Covid-19, this year’s annual Best Under A Billion list highlights the resilience of 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies in the Asia-Pacific region with sales under $1 billion. Their sound financial figures reflect how well these companies coped in the midst of a global pandemic. No surprise: Healthcare and pharmaceutical-related companies were standouts while tech and logistics firms linked to the global e-commerce boom also benefited. As proof of BUB companies’ sustainable success, 42 were returnees from the previous year. This includes Taiwan’s Aspeed, now on the list for a notable eight years in a row. We’ve highlighted eight companies from the list with businesses that helped alleviate the pandemic’s effects.  Getty Images While its agrochemical business faced a tough year, sales of this India-based agri-biotech company were up 12% and net profit surged for the year to March, thanks to a real-time Covid-19 PCR detection kit developed by a subsidiary. Kilpest became the first Indian company to get approval from the Food & Drug Administration for emergency use of this kit in the U.S.   Getty Images This Thailand-based pharmaceutical company’s revenue grew 11% to $402 million in 2020 as demand for its dietary supplements, drugs and vitamins rose during the pandemic. Last year, the company acquired Futamed Pharmaceuticals, now renamed Mega Lifesciences Indonesia.   Getty Images Working from home during the pandemic spurred demand for Optim’s remote working tools.

"Rain or Shine Golf, a retailer and manufacturer of equipment and accessories for at-home golf, has become dominant in its space since it was founded in 2016, growing 150% year over year since its inception. [Data is self-reported.] In that short span, the Charlotte, NC-based company has become the top name for home golf simulator and at-home golf equipment, with Golf News Net (GNN) deferring to them as the acknowledged experts in their field and even Engadget treating them as their go-to for ratings and reviews for golf simulators, launch monitors, and other at-home golf equipment. The two founders and co-owners, Zach Vandervelt and Shawn Foley (both age 29), are old high school golfing teammates who reconnected after college and realized, at a burger-and-fries lunch reunion, that they were both hungry for an entrepreneurial adventure. Foley in particular was unfulfilled, working in insurance as an underwriter on cyber security and “not feeling challenged or stimulated, to put it mildly.”   Rain or Shine Golf co-founders/co-owners Zach Vandervelt and Shawn Foley with their SwingBay® golf ... [+] simulator screen and enclosure Vandervelt was having a bit more fun with some fledgling eCommerce projects, though he didn’t really have the hang of it, he freely confesses now. “My most wildly off-the-mark effort was a bean bag chair business. Nothing against bean bags, except: What is a central part of eCommerce? Shipping. That’s right.  And is there anything heavier and more awkward to ship than a bean bag chair?” They brainstormed “at least fifty” ideas for a business, but kept returning to their first impulse, indoor putting greens, which evolved into a more general focus on at-home golfing. “We ultimately discarded the other 49 ideas,” Vandervelt tells me, and “focused on the one that truly interested us, because it was within the world of golf.” (It has since surprised them, Foley tells me, “how little golf is involved in what we do day to day. The big work for us has been learning to grow a business, which was a whole new world to us, from the financial scorekeeping and forecasting to the product strategy and marketing aspects to logistics and HR. But it does make the nitty gritty work more fun when we’re able to take a moment to gain perspective on how big golf is in the world and how we are having greater impact than just being two of the tens of millions that play this crazy sport.”) The two co-founders have a naturally easy relationship, but have chosen to divide their responsibilities somewhat formally. “From the beginning,” says Vandervelt, the way we've split our roles is: I take on more of the strategy, in e-commerce, marketing, and growth. And Shawn's more focused on operations, sales, customer service, and product development. I think we’re both rather analytical people, but Shawn is more so, and I may be slightly more the ‘strategic dreamer’.”  One thing they agreed on early was that they wanted a “connected” business in the sense of having all their operations under one roof, which they’ve achieved in spades, housing their customer service and sales teams, warehouse, shipping, and product development at a single location in Charlotte, with much of their custom manufacturing being done within the state as well. This proximity has fed one of Rain or Shine’s advantages: unlike some competitors, Rain or Shine ships many of its products direct-to-consumer from its own dock rather than having them drop-shipped from elsewhere. This allows Rain or Shine’s team to perform QC inspections as well as reduce the number of boxes a customer receives compared to what they’d find on their doorstep if the units were individually shipped directly from the manufacturing plant.  Foley and Vandervelt have also tried to keep a close ear on customer feedback, collecting it and using it in product design and refinement.  “Our custom turf product is an example of this. It’s a direct response to the dissatisfaction we recognized in the market. The two [existing] market leaders in turf were far from ideal, either too soft or too thick; neither of them giving a good feeling when you hit down into the turf. So we set out on a project to design our own specs for what we felt the best simulation of real grass would be.” In the end, they devoted nearly six months to experimentation and refinement, ultimately creating a product they call SwingTurf, “which we—and our customers—are very happy with. [Disclosure: I have given them assistance in improving their customer service.] The pandemic amplified everything As the pandemic changed consumer behavior, beginning early in 2020, the effect on Rain or Shine was immediate. “From a demand standpoint, we’ve had our minds completely blown by how that’s increased during the pandemic,” says Foley. “With everybody on lockdown, golf emerged as one of the few activities you could still do [at home] while everything outside your door was shut down. Pair this with the eCommerce boom, and we were in a very sweet spot on the demand side.” The tricky aspect of this has been twofold: trying to not disappoint that influx of customers due to supply chain delays and interruptions; although almost all of Rain or Shine’s manufacturing is done in the U.S., it’s still experienced quite a few supply, manufacturing, and transportation-spawned delays. The other challenge was to rapidly grow their business on the employee side. “We’re two young guys learning the business ropes as quickly as we can,” says Foley, “and we found ourselves suddenly responsible for more than a dozen humans, learning to manage human emotions during uncertainty…it’s not easy, but it’s essential.”  **** I was curious whether, when these challenges weigh him down, Foley ever gets the hankering to return to the world of insurance underwriting. “Oh, no. Not even slightly,” he says with a laugh. “I feel so engaged here every day—engaged with design challenges, with employees, with customers.” And, Vandervelt chimed in, “I don’t ever want to see another bean bag, not even a single bean, if I can avoid it. And, on that front, So far, so good.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2021/09/07/rain-or-shine-golf-how-two-young-golfing-buddies-came-to-dominate-the-at-home-golf-industry/,Rain Or Shine Golf: How Two Golfing Buddies Grew To Dominate The At-Home Golf Industry
"Mexico’s highest court ruled laws penalizing women for abortion are unconstitutional Tuesday, setting the stage for the practice to be decriminalized in a country dominated by the Catholic Church, just one week after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Texas to ban most abortions. The Supreme Court of Mexico The Mexican Supreme Court struck down a law criminalizing nearly all abortions in the state of Coahuila, which sits alongside the U.S.-Mexico border, several Mexican and international news outlets reported Tuesday. All 10 judges who were present in court Tuesday reportedly voted in favor of striking down the law, which imposed prison sentences of up to three years on women who receive abortions, except in narrow cases like rape or risk to a mother’s health. The ruling initially applies just to Coahuila’s law, but it sets a precedent for judges to strike down similar laws in other states, the Associated Press and Telemundo reported. Mexican reproductive rights group GIRE celebrated the ruling, which it called “historic” on Twitter, but the right-of-center National Action Party indicated opposition to abortion in a Monday statement tied to the Supreme Court case, the Washington Post noted. Prior to Tuesday’s ruling, Mexico City and three Mexican states allowed women to seek out abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but most states barred the procedure except in cases like rape and health risk. Most people in Mexico affiliate with the Catholic Church, which is staunchly opposed to abortion and has led political efforts to restrict the procedure. Meanwhile, some members of the country’s ruling left-of-center Morena party support easing abortion restrictions, but the party’s leader — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — demurred last year and said the question should be decided via public consultation. Mexico is moving to loosen abortion restrictions as some U.S. states vie to ban or heavily restrict the procedure. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to block a Texas law that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is usually about six weeks into a pregnancy, reportedly rendering the vast majority of the state’s abortions illegal. And the Supreme Court is set to review Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks during its current term, meaning the court — which is now controlled by a 6-3 conservative majority — could modify or overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide. Abortion is either illegal or heavily restricted in most Latin American nations, but Mexico is the latest majority-Catholic country to ease its restrictions. Argentina legalized abortion up to 14 weeks late last year, and Irish citizens voted in 2018 to repeal their country’s ban on abortion.

"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott defended the state’s controversial near-total ban on abortion and its lack of exceptions for victims of rape and incest Tuesday, misleadingly stating that rape victims can still get abortions under the law and claiming that the government will “eliminate all rapists” in the state. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott speaks in Tyler, Texas, on September 7. Texas law Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) has drawn significant criticism since going into effect last week, as the law bans abortions after a “fetal heartbeat” is detected—a term medical experts have criticized as misleading—and has an exception only for medical emergencies. Asked Tuesday about the law forcing rape and incest victims to carry their pregnancies to term, Abbott claimed the law “doesn’t require that at all” because it “provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion.” Fetal heartbeats can be detected approximately six weeks into a pregnancy, which medical experts say is before many people know they’re pregnant.  The six week calculation is also dated from a pregnant person’s last period, which means the actual window to get an abortion could be more like two weeks even if they realize early enough that they are pregnant. Abbott also claimed the Texas government would reduce pregnancies through rape, saying the state would “work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas.” The governor claimed the state would be “aggressively going out and arresting [rapists] and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets”—historically the vast majority of rapists are never prosecuted, convicted or even reported to police.  310 out of 1,000. That’s the approximate number of sexual assaults that are reported to police, according to statistics from RAINN based on U.S. Department of Justice data. According to the FBI, there were 24,986 rape-related arrests in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, and the Washington Post calculated in 2018 that less than 1% of all rapes and attempted rapes result in felony convictions. Abbott’s comments Tuesday have sparked widespread opposition from abortion rights advocates. “Greg Abbott is lying” about rape victims still being able to get an abortion, former San Antonio mayor and presidential candidate Julian Castro tweeted Tuesday, while progressive group Ultraviolet said of Abbott’s comments, “Maybe if you don't understand basic biology you shouldn't legislate bodily autonomy away.” SB 8,  enacted last week, is likely to block approximately 85% of abortions in Texas, abortion providers estimate, making it the most extreme anti-abortion law to be imposed in the U.S. since the 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade. In addition to the law’s failure to carve out exceptions for rape and incest, SB 8 has also drawn significant controversy for its stipulation that it can only be enforced by private citizens, who are empowered to sue anyone who “aids and abets” an abortion and receive at least $10,000 if they’re successful, which many have decried as putting a “bounty” on those seeking abortions. In addition to Democrats and companies like Uber, Lyft and Bumble that have already mobilized against the law, it has sparked pushback from even some anti-abortion Republicans. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday they believe the law’s lawsuit enforcement mechanism goes too far, and Kinzinger also took issue with the law not having rape and incest exceptions.

"Speaks for itself. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) New business formation nationwide certainly has its monthly ups and downs, almost as a mirror image of declines and jumps in covid infections, but on balance the data point to recovery and a bright immediate economic outlook. The latest figures for July show just under 500,000 new business applications nationwide. That is up 1.2% from the June level. Almost half the applications, some 216,000, occurred in the south – effectively the old Confederacy — which for some time now has been the fastest growing region in the country. The Northeast showed the greatest rise from the June level, a 5.3% increase. Though still the most populous region of the country, it accounts for barely 15% of the nationwide applications to start a new business. The West also saw a relatively steep rise from June, 5.1%, and though the least densely populated region of the country, accounted for twice the number of applications as the Northeast. Still more encouraging is the reported rise in what the Census Bureau calls “high propensity applications,” by which it means those new businesses with a high likelihood of supporting a payroll. These, though only some one-third of total applications, also jumped some 1.2% from June’s level for the nation as a whole and had a similar regional pattern to applications overall, with the largest proportion in the South and the strongest monthly jumps in the Northeast and the West. What is most encouraging is how these latest numbers begin to correct a disappointing decline this past spring. That drop in business formation accompanied a rise in Covid infections. Before this decline, both total and high-propensity applications showed good growth. Between December 2020 and this past May, for instance, overall applications to form a new business jumped some 45%. Applications to form a business with a high propensity to support a payroll rose some 43%. This impressive growth was present in every major region. But as infections began to rise, the enthusiasm for new business formation waned. Overall new business applications nationwide fell 10% in June, while high-propensity applications fell 8.9%. This pattern prevailed in every major region. The news created the feeling that new business enthusiasm had broken. Even though the July growth failed to correct fully for the June drop, the rise in new business formation, even as infection rates continued upward, has restored the sense that business still has an appetite for new ventures. Especially if an increase in vaccinations creates a declining rate of infections, this picture on new business formation leaves room to expect that the economy’s remarkable recovery will sustain its momentum through the remainder of this year and into 2022. Longer term, the economy does face constraints. A labor shortage clearly already exists that in time will depress growth potentials. Inflationary pressures have also become apparent, perhaps in part because of the labor shortage but for other reasons as well. The inflation itself as well as the kinds of policies that it will likely elicit also raise questions about longer-term growth potentials. In time, large and growing budget deficits will also have an adverse economic effect. These and other matters raise serious questions about the economy’s progress later in 2022 and beyond. But for the period immediately ahead, growth prospects look bright, and this latest news on new business formation has brightened those prospects still further.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2021/09/07/new-business-formation-tells-of-a-brighter-immediate-economic-outlook/,New Business Formation Tells Of A Brighter Immediate Economic Outlook
"More than 250,000 children tested positive for Covid-19 last week in the U.S., according to a report published Tuesday by the American Academy of Pediatrics which shows cases are continuing to soar following the start of the school year.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 04: A member of staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) takes a ... [+] child's temperature at the Harris Academy's Shortland's school on June 04, 2020 in London, England. As part of Covid-19 lockdown measures, Harris Academy schools have taught smaller pods of students, to help maintain social distancing measures. With restrictions now lifting and the Government encouraging schools to re-open, the school staff has been working to find the best way to provide extra spaces while still retaining the correct social distancing measures and cleanliness requirements. This week, some schools across England reopened for some students, with children in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 allowed to return first. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) The report from the pediatrics group counted 251,781 cases of the coronavirus among children between August 26 and September 2 based on data provided by 49 states.  This marks a 25% increase from the week prior, which was already up exponentially from the roughly 50,000 cases tallied during the last week of July.  Children now make up more than a quarter of all new coronavirus cases in the U.S., with some states, like Tennessee, reporting shares that are even higher.  The AAP highlighted that kids made up about 15% of new infections for most of the pandemic, a number that began to rise in late July.  Death and hospitalization from Covid-19 among children still appear to be extremely rare, with between 0.1% and 1.9% of cases resulting in hospitalization and between 0.00 and 0.03% of cases resulting in death, according to the AAP.  However, the group reiterated its “urgent” plea for “more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children,” ranging from impacts on the “long-term physical health” of infected kids to “emotional and mental health effects.”  750,000. That’s how many children tested positive for Covid-19 between August 5 and September 2, according to the AAP.  Growing numbers of children have been testing positive for the virus since the start of the school year in late July. Booming case numbers have led to the closures of at least 1,000 schools across 31 different states, according to data cited by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, the number of children hospitalized with Covid-19 has also continued to reach new pandemic peaks, overwhelming pediatric hospitals in virus hotspots. Almost 2,400 children were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 as of Tuesday, more than at any other point in the pandemic, data from the Department of Health and Human Services show. The uptick in children being hospitalized with the virus has contributed to “unprecedented strain” on the U.S.’s “children’s health care safety net,” said Children’s Hospital Association President Mark Wietecha in a letter sent to President Biden late last month, warning“[t]here may not be sufficient bed capacity or expert staff to care for children and families in need” as the school year progresses.  “These Are The Parents Most Likely To Oppose School Mask Mandates, Poll Finds” (Forbes) “Child Covid-19 Cases Rise in States Where Schools Opened Earliest” (Wall Street Journal) “Children's Hospitals Are Pleading For Federal Help As They Run Out Of Beds” (NPR) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/07/at-least-250000-kids-tested-positive-for-covid-last-week-as-school-year-surge-continues/,"At Least 250,000 Kids Tested Positive For Covid In The U.S. Last Week As School Year Surge Continues"
"If you were to look inside the cells of all living things, you would find a common code in the form of DNA. In talking about code, we tend to immediately think of the digital code associated with computers, but DNA, the blueprint of life, is a biological code that is not so different. Where computer code uses 0’s and 1’s to program software to execute a task, our biological code uses A’s, C’s, G’s, and T’s to program cells to accomplish specific functions necessary for life.  Now, a biotech company by the name of Ginkgo Bioworks is applying to synthetic biology the same principles of computer programming that companies like Microsoft

  pioneered that transformed our daily lives. Jason Kelly, co-founder and chief executive officer of Ginkgo Bioworks Inc., sits for a photograph ... [+] at the company's facility in Boston, Massachusetts. Photographer: Scott Eisen/Bloomberg Simply put, synthetic biology is the field of biology that manipulates and reprograms the DNA, or biological code, of living organisms to generate an alternative natural product. As Dr. Jason Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, explains this week on A Second Opinion podcast, we can find synthetic biology quietly hidden all around us from the food industry to the fashion world. For example, Burger King’s meatless Impossible Burger that “bleeds” like meat was “enabled by a pretty magical component from synthetic biology which is an animal protein without the animal,” Kelly explains. Using the power of this new field of science, the code for the animal hemoglobin protein was coded into yeast, creating a veggie burger that has the smell, taste, and consistency of a traditional beef burger.  More recently, Ginkgo customer Genomatica partnered with Lululemon to create biosynthesized plant-based nylon fabric that eliminates the microplastics that appear in other nylon and microfiber fabrics, creating a more environmentally-friendly yoga pant.  Ginkgo is pushing the field of biology toward the engineering industry, and has labeled itself “The Organism Company” with the mission to program cells like we have been programming computers. Drawing comparisons to Apple, Kelly broke down the Ginkgo vision for me, where Ginkgo aims to serve as the horizontal platform for synthetic biology products (much like the App Store on Apple devices). Ginkgo does not bring products to market, rather they work with companies to develop the desired synthesized DNA code and then charge a royalty when the physical good produced from that code is made available. This innovative approach allows companies, including startups who struggle to afford the multimillion-dollar cost to set up a lab, the freedom to outsource the time and expense of arduous lab work and grants to Ginkgo and the flexibility to operate in a variety of biotech markets. The current pandemic has been pivotal in showcasing the importance of synthetic biology and DNA manipulation. Synthetic biology is providing more efficient ways of producing mRNA vaccines, with a recent Ginkgo partnership creating an engineered cell that creates a key enzyme used in mRNA vaccine manufacturing that is 10-times more efficient and has the potential to lower costs and speed up production.  Covid has also provided an opportunity for Ginkgo to think about the future of biosecurity, specifically through the lenses of detection and prevention. On this topic Kelly told me, “We are entering the era of being able to design and program biology, and, I would say, we just have evidence that our biosecurity capabilities in the U.S. are not very good.” The CEO would like to see a “muscling up” around biosecurity for both national security reasons as well as for public health reasons. He adds, “It’s the topic of the moment and the U.S. should not waste the next 18 months where the pandemic is still an issue in the U.S., and importantly worldwide, to build that.”  Ginkgo is using these next 18 months to build up biosecurity measures via the concept of surveillance testing. “You know what viruses are potentially flowing through your computer right now, but you have no idea what’s in the air.” Kelly feels that we need more widespread, routine Covid-19 testing, which he hopes will allow decision makers to have access to more information. He adds, “when a governor has to make a decision about how to contain the virus, they don’t have to close down a whole state. They can close down a town, or a city, or a school, or a classroom because they know exactly where the virus is. They are not having to do gross interventions that ruin everyone’s life, they are able to make targeted interventions.”  It has been easy to see the direct impact that a biotech company like Ginkgo has had during the pandemic, from the biological monitoring methods they are currently working on to the production of an enzyme allowing for more efficient creation of mRNA vaccines. The broader scope of a company like this cannot be ignored. Kelly estimates that his platform roughly doubles in efficiency each year, tripling the output and halving the cost per project annually. Ginkgo is adding nearly 30 new products to its repertoire this year with the goal of producing up to 500 new products during 2025. It’s valued at an impressive $15 billion and has been listed for the past three years on CNBC's Disruptor 50 List of fast-growing companies. Where the computer age disrupted the information-based industries, the Ginkgo synthetic biology platform is completely altering the physical goods industry. When I asked about future markets Kelly responded, “Engineered cells… they don’t move information around; they move atoms around. So, the industries they disrupt won’t be the information-based industries, they will be the physical good industries—and all of them. From building materials to food to pharma to electronics, they are all biotech industries—they just don’t know it yet.” Synthetic biology has the potential to usher in the next industrial revolution, changing the future of food to make it more sustainable and plant-based, engineering biofuel to reduce oil and gas dependance, and transforming medical treatments to effectively target various diseases, and Ginkgo Bioworks is at the forefront.

"North Carolina State Legislative Building in Raleigh, NC Recent polling from Pew Research shows trust in the media has plummeted in recent years. National media outlets, both television and print, offer plenty of instances of news coverage that is slanted or incomplete so as to serve a political agenda or aid a particular political party. Though people like to talk about local newspapers with great reverence, misinformation is also found in plenty of local media outlets, either through omission or commission. A Durham Herald-Sun column published on August 30 provides a timely example of such locally spread misinformation.  In that Herald-Sun column Stephen Greenberg, a Chapel Hill-based tax accountant, portrays North Carolina as an outlier when it comes to the taxation of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds that small businesses used as a financial lifeline to survive over the past year: “Thousands of small business owners in North Carolina who received Paycheck Protection Program money are being treated unfairly by the state,” Greenberg writes. “It’s the fault of the N.C. General Assembly.”  Yet, never once in his entire article does Greenberg inform readers that North Carolina legislators have already enacted a bill to exempt forgiven PPP loans from state income tax. He alludes to it when he notes that last year “the General Assembly passed a law that changed the taxation of PPP forgiveness.” Yet he never explains to readers what that change accomplished, which is to exempt forgiven PPP loans from state income tax. That Greenberg withholds such information is both odd and a disservice to readers.  What Greenberg’s column is addressing, though he doesn’t clarify it for readers, is the fact that under current law businesses cannot deduct expenses paid with PPP funding when calculating their state tax liability, as they are allowed to do when tabulating their federal tax burden. Here again, Greenberg leaves readers in the dark by not mentioning that the new state budgets approved this summer by both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly include provisions that rectify this matter. North Carolina House and Senate lawmakers are currently working out the differences between their two budgets in conference committee, and the final product to be sent to Governor Roy Cooper’s (D) desk is expected to include language that will have the state conform with federal tax deductibility for expenses paid with PPP funds.  “Recent figures show that approximately 22,861 PPP loans over $150,000 were issued in North Carolina, as well as 242,523 smaller than $150,000,” Greenberg writes. “Among them were thousands of small business owners. I hope each one of them will contact the General Assembly and get N.C. legislators to correct this unfair tax.”  Greenberg could’ve informed readers that the North Carolina General Assembly has already taken action to ensure that state income tax is not assessed on forgiven PPP loans. He could’ve also informed readers that North Carolina legislators are in the process of fixing the remainder of the problem, which is the focus of his article, as part of the new budget that Governor Cooper could sign into law as soon as this month. Yet Mr. Greenberg chose not to clue readers in on that relevant information, perhaps because it completely debunks his narrative that legislators in North Carolina are harming small businesses.  In fact, when it comes to the tax treatment of small businesses in North Carolina, state legislators, led by Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) & Speaker Tim Moore (R), have provided significant relief to small businesses in recent years through income tax rate reduction. As recently as 2013, North Carolina small businesses, the majority of which file their taxes under the individual income tax system, faced the highest state income tax rate in southeastern United States at 7.75%. Over the past eight years, the Republican-led General Assembly has enacted multiple rounds of rate-reducing tax reform, ultimately bringing the personal income tax rate down to a flat 5.25%, which is now the lowest in the region aside from the no-income-tax states of Tennessee and Florida. The compromise budget deal that will soon be released from the conference committee will include another reduction in North Carolina’s personal income tax rate, possibly taking the rate down as low as 3.99%.  At the same time that North Carolina lawmakers are working to finalize a budget that provides more relief to small businesses and households with a reduction in the personal income tax rate, they’re also seeking to provide relief for low income taxpayers. The budget deal to be released from the conference committee is also expected increase the standard deduction, as both the House and Senate versions of the new budget expand the zero tax bracket in a way that will provide relief to households who need it the most, raising the threshold at which state income tax begins to be assessed from $21,500 to $25,500 for married couples. Senate leaders estimate that the standard deduction increase included in their new budget would remove 200,000 North Carolinians from state income tax rolls. According to IRS data for tax year 2018, the most recent year available, more than 817,000 small businesses filed under the individual income tax system in North Carolina. That figure only represents sole proprietors. More than 262,000 partnership and S-corp owners also pay the personal income tax rate.  Thanks to the multiple rounds of tax reform enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly, more than a million small businesses across the state have a much lower tax burden today than was the case a decade ago and, subsequently, have greater capacity to hire new workers and give existing employees raises. This, like the fact that North Carolina legislators have addressed half of the PPP taxation problem and are getting ready to rectify the rest as part of the new budget, runs contrary to the August 30 Herald-Sun story about Republicans allegedly hurting small businesses. Rather than harm small businesses by prohibiting the tax deductibility of expenses paid with PPP funds, which is is not going to happen so long as Governor Cooper signs the new budget, North Carolina legislators have actually done more to provide tax relief to small businesses than have lawmakers of perhaps any other state.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2021/09/07/smear-of-north-carolina-lawmakers-requires-withholding-of-key-information/,Smear Of North Carolina Lawmakers Requires Withholding Of Key Information

With two more wins in the region, the rapper has now charted a milestone 20 top 10s in the U.S. A dozen of West’s 23 new Hot 100 placements start off inside the top 40, certifying them as at least minor, momentary hits.

Donda is chock full of guest appearances and contributions from some of the biggest musical stars of the day, but for some reason, West chose not to officially credit any of them for their work.

Steve Carra, who in June introduced legislation to create a “forensic audit” of the 2020 election in Michigan, a key state whose 16 electoral votes contributed to President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Forbes has reached out to Upton’s campaign for comment. Trump has previously endorsed primary challengers to Reps.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who voted for conviction, calling him “’Gloomy’ Pat Toomey” in a statement and claiming the only reason he isn’t running for reelection in 2022 is “I would not give him my endorsement.” Trump has endorsed veteran Sean Parnell, his close ally, in the race to replace Toomey.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/07/trump-revenge-tour-ex-president-endorses-challenger-to-fourth-republican-who-voted-for-impeachment/,Trump Revenge Tour: Ex-President Endorses Challenger To Fourth Republican Who Voted For Impeachment
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the state’s restrictive voting bill into law Tuesday after it was passed last week by the state legislature—and a flood of lawsuits had already been filed aiming to strike the law down even less than an hour after it was signed. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott shows off voting bill SB 1 after he signed it into law in Tyler, Texas, on ... [+] Sept. 7. Abbott signed Senate Bill 1 (SB 1) into law, which imposes such restrictions on voting as prohibiting drive-through voting, 24-hour polling places and sending out unsolicited mail-in ballot applications; imposing voter ID requirements for mail-in ballots and criminalizing ballots being submitted by third parties, which Republicans refer to as “ballot harvesting.” Two lawsuits had already been filed in federal court against the bill even before it was signed, brought by voter advocacy groups, community organizations and the elections administrator in Harris County, among others. Those lawsuits allege SB 1 violates federal law including the Voting Rights Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, Civil Rights Act and the First, 14th and 15th Amendments, with one lawsuit slamming the voting bill’s alleged “cruel targeting of vulnerable voters and community organizations.” Minutes after Abbott’s signed SB 1 into law, LULAC Texas, Voto Latino, the Texas Alliance for Retired Americans and the Texas AFT brought a third federal lawsuit challenging the law, which alleges violations of the Voting Rights Act and the First and 14th Amendments. Two additional lawsuits were then filed against the law, one of which was brought by the Texas State Conference of the NAACP and other groups in state court and one which the NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought on behalf of several Houston-based organizations and the Delta Sigma Theta sorority in federal court. The lawsuits all argue the law’s provisions that restrict voter access illegally suppress votes from vulnerable populations—particularly voters of color—though some of the lawsuits also argue the law violates the rights of other groups including voters with disabilities and elderly voters.  “The Legislature enacted SB 1 not to preserve election integrity or combat election fraud—after all the state’s own election officials have acknowledged that elections in Texas are already secure—but rather to stem the growing tide of minority voter participation by weaponizing the false, repeatedly debunked accusations of widespread voter fraud advanced by supporters of former President Donald Trump during the 2020 presidential election,” plaintiffs alleged in the lawsuit filed Tuesday by LULAC Texas and other groups, which is backed by Democratic Party voting rights attorney Marc Elias. “I feel extremely confident that when this law makes it through the litigation phase, it will be upheld in a court of law,” Abbott said Tuesday after signing the bill, claiming that “no one who is eligible to vote will be denied the opportunity to vote.” The law “does however make it harder for cheaters to cast an illegal ballot,” Abbott added. “Those are the kinds of principles that the courts will uphold.” Though SB 1 has been widely criticized for its restrictions on voting, the law also has several measures that are more beneficial to voter access, including allowing voters to cure their ballots to ensure they’re counted if there are any deficiencies and expanding hours for early voting. How the legal challenges will hold up in court after the U.S. Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act earlier this year. The high court upheld restrictive voting laws in Arizona that critics alleged were racially discriminatory and imposed a more restrictive test for determining whether voting laws violate the Voting Rights Act, which could affect the Texas lawsuits and their allegations that SB 1 violates the federal law. The Supreme Court ruling also stated that wanting to prevent voter fraud is a “strong and entirely legitimate state interest” that justifies voting restrictions—despite such fraud being exceedingly rare—which Abbott has said is the state’s intention with SB 1’s restrictions. SB 1 is part of a broader trend of GOP lawmakers imposing new restrictions on voting nationwide in the wake of the 2020 election. The Texas law has proved particularly contentious, however, as Texas Democrats in the state legislature initially blocked the bill’s passage in the House by first walking out of the chamber as it was first put up for a vote in May, and then leaving the state entirely to block the bill’s passage after Abbott called a separate special session so it could pass. Enough Democrats returned for the chamber to ultimately regain its quorum on August 19, and the voting bill passed the state legislature on August 31.

Key appointments include Ricky Strauss, the former President of Content & Marketing at Disney+ and President of Marketing for Walt Disney Studios 
  
  DIS 
 , Heather Moosnick of NOWwith and Hulu, Charlie Andrew’s from Fox (who was formerly at Netflix 
  
  NFLX 
 ) and former Vice President at NBCUniversal, Jon Cotton. Strauss is set to be Chairman of the board. Ricky Strauss said on the new venture: “The idea behind Binj is such a singular unmet need in the marketplace and I believe that people will enjoy the opportunity to learn what their peers and trusted community are recommending as far as content consumption choices. I’m not only very encouraged by how it can fill a gap in the market, but also by the team behind the venture, who are both impressive and focused.” The board is currently positioned to advise and facilitate expansion, strategic development and partnerships. This expansion accelerated in June with the hiring of Steven Barrow Barlow as CFO. Barrow Barlow co-founded Kallpod, a hospitality-focused tech company, following a decade as a securities analyst on Wall Street at BofA Merrill Lynch. He also currently invests in early-stage startups through Andon Okapi Holdings, a newly-formed investment syndicate.  Binj’s purpose stems from the growing overload of content encompassing viewers. There are now over 300 streaming services across the world with Netflix alone currently streaming 15,000 film and TV titles globally across all genres. The platform seeks to take advantage of this in an area that has seemingly been overlooked, with Binj positioned to be the world’s first social media network for TV and streaming video content. Analysis of the market paints a surprising picture. Twitter records at least 10 million tweets daily on movies and TV shows whilst, in 2020, Reddit had 300,000 conversations per month around similar content. Hazel Steward, Co-Founder and COO stated, “To have access to a platform like Binj and, not only discover, but discuss content that you’re passionate about in an environment that is specifically curated for entertainment, allows users the capability to truly capture and dictate the content zeitgeist and answers a long-standing unmet need in the marketplace.”  Reza Hashemi, Co-Founder & CEO of Binj said, “Binj is embracing a world where most people are interacting online. Therefore, we have built an enhanced platform, to create a social community for movie buffs across the globe to discuss, vote and recommend what is on both our big and small screens.” Users will be able to start discussions with friends, family and even the public-at-large, create lists, post reviews, vote and recommend content with Binj’s algorithms taking that data - and importantly users’ personal emotions - to transmit recommendations. Hashemi notes the platform’s “emotion-driven rating system” as a key driver for the network. “Our mission is to allow people to make their streaming decisions based on emotions, not biased algorithms, to solve information overload and ultimately save users time searching for what to watch.” The app, exclusively available for iOS, is soft-launching this month and is raising seed round investment.

Biden — who is pushing a giant infrastructure spending bill, including major funding for the green economy — argues that extreme weather across the United States this summer is a harbinger of worse climate change to come. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Shalanda Young, the acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote a blog post urging Congress to pass a continuing resolution (CR) to provide lawmakers leeway to pass an annual budget after September 30, the last day of the fiscal year. Young said that in addition to funding critical public services to avoid “severe disruptions,” Congress should appropriate $6.4 billion to help screen and resettle Afghans who assisted U.S. forces and were evacuated from Afghanistan amid the rise of the Taliban. An administration official said those funds include $2.4 billion to fund the bases where Afghans are being screened, $1.3 billion for resettlement operations, $1.7 billion for refugee benefits and services and $193 million to accelerate the application process for permanent resident status. Young also called for at least $14 billion in natural disaster assistance covering storms, fires and other disasters over the last 18 months – including Hurricanes Laura and Delta – estimating that damage from Hurricane Ida will require at least an additional $10 billion in relief. “Climate change is producing more severe natural disasters like storms and wildfires,” an administration official said of the need for additional disaster relief in a press call. Another official added, “Red and blue states are having to respond to more frequent and intense disasters, and more extreme ones more frequently.” 65,000. That’s roughly the number of vulnerable Afghans are expected to arrive in the U.S. by the end of September, with an additional 30,000 expected over the next 12 months, an official said.

"There’s been a long-held concept that a supply chain could be agile or lean, but not both. In last month’s article, we explored how with the right digital transformation, there is no reason why a company can’t be both. Here, we’ll discuss the ways to get there. When supplies are abundant and external variables are “predictable” the notion is to act on cutting down on expenses. However, organizations that have undergone a digital transformation know that a combined agile and lean supply chain is possible. Digital transformation is necessary to regain a hold on inventory management, yet it requires C-level buy-in. At the height of the pandemic, there was a rush to stop the bleeding by testing and implementing new technologies, but as companies have now settled in for the long haul, they have quickly reverted to slow and lengthy decisions and implementations. As more time passes, there is less incentive for leadership to approve new technologies. That stall to move forward will leave companies more vulnerable when another “black swan event” arrives and upends the way businesses operate. It’s time to take the necessary steps to be as best prepared as possible for whatever may come next. When done right, digital transformation in the supply chain makes your organization even more efficient today while meeting the challenges of the unknown. Yes, making the digital transformation can be intimidating, but five steps are essential for making a smooth transition that will enable having both a lean and an agile environment to have a more resilient supply chain.  1. Data foundation is critical, but data cleansing is not Traditional processes are broken. To be agile, the network should be able to understand data accurately and send signals with supply chain updates. But legacy systems and processes cannot keep up with the amount of manual data cleansing required to be efficient. To create a consistently agile supply chain, organizations have to understand their data across systems, both in-house and with your supplier network. As long as you understand your data, you can use existing data, incomplete and dirty, to drive outcomes more effectively and still carve a path to be agile and lean. 2. Digitizing the supply chain Shipping physical goods from supplier to supplier to user needs an efficient system. If you aren’t getting the most from your data and if new systems are dependent on human data entry, the supply chain weakens. A digital supply chain means digitized goods, processes, and logistics. Yes, it requires taking manual processes and transitioning to a digital one, but once you lay the data foundation, you are enabling that data can be understood, intelligence presented to a human expert, and the “why” of decisions can be accounted for across the supply network.  3. Strategic supplier alignment The important part of resiliency is the ability to interact and understand the operational risk. When shipments are predictable, they can be planned for, but if the shipment is now 40 weeks out instead of the regular four weeks, supply chain management is thrown off the rails. With digital transformation, it is easier to align with your suppliers. In a digitized supply chain, when you realize you need certain items, your supplier also can know it by sharing your data easily across platforms. The system will keep all parties in the loop with the changes. By building this network that allows you to be both agile and lean, you can pivot on demand.  4. Change management and understanding intentions across organizations Change management is really about incentive alignment. As you’re undergoing a digital transformation, procurement will have different incentives than operations or financial. When the incentives don’t align with the goals you’re trying to achieve, you end up creating silos. And silos can’t scale to your real-time needs. Understanding how to bridge and align incentives takes you back to being both agile and lean. You can drive out costs and trust your risk is as low as possible. In this step, you see how the other three steps build upon each other. Procurement can save money with strategic supplier alignment, for example, which is built through a digitized supply chain and a solid data foundation.  5. Speed and changing the dynamic of the supply chain Executing the digital transformation of the supply chain can’t wait. It is a time-consuming project. But putting it off for years or turning to the technology solutions of the past just means that you won’t be able to react and readjust your supply chain when the next “black swan event” comes along, and this will ultimately be a major detriment when it comes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulnoble/2021/09/07/top-five-ways-to-become-agile-and-lean-in-your-supply-chain/,Top Five Ways To Become Agile And Lean In Your Supply Chain
"Dolly Meckler, founder of Challah Dolly, Photo Credit: Griff Lipson For Dolly Meckler, founder of Challah Dolly, the Jewish High Holiday season that includes Rosh Hashanah (which is the Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), can essentially be considered her business’ “Black Friday” in terms of demand.  Meckler’s signature selection of challah loaves are available year-round on Challah Dolly’s website, but she created a round loaf of challah to be enjoyed for the Jewish holidays, in two flavors: regular and cinnamon raisin. (According to Jewish tradition, the round shape symbolizes the circle of life and cinnamon raisin signifies a “sweet New Year.”).  But first, let’s slow our scroll: what is Challah Dolly? Challah Dolly is a New York-based company founded by 29-year-old Dolly Meckler, which ships its loaves of the traditionally Jewish bread (known for its braided look and egg-based recipe) weekly across the United States, and is available at several bakeries in New York City.  She successfully managed to take her bread-making business from curbside to nationwide, within a year, all thanks to a drive for sparking joy, a passion for storytelling, and a devotion to encourage people to “eat and enjoy bread.” Its origin story involves the pandemic, happenstance, the magic of bringing people together over bread, and Meckler’s mission “to make Jewish tradition ‘cool, modern and accessible.’” A New Yorker feature this past May and a nationwide distribution plan have helped make Meckler’s brand a bona fide food business. For Meckler, baking bread served as a passion project during peak quarantine, back in March 2020. One could say it was an accidental career opportunity, more than a pivot.  Meckler had been working as the social media manager for HBO’s Game of Thrones and Westworld for four years, followed by a social media role at YouTube. The native New Yorker wanted to take a risk — “the plan was to not have a plan,” she explains — so she moved to Los Angeles in October 2019 and set out to find freelance social media work and focus on her web series and podcast, Hello Dolly!. And then, the pandemic hit and like many others, her plans took a dramatic detour.  Here’s where Meckler’s social media skills came into play and worked for her: in the midst of the doom and gloom created by COVID, Meckler took up baking.  “Instead of stressing out about this, I decided I was going to bake,” Meckler shares.  She didn’t cave into the sourdough phenomenon that became ubiquitous on Instagram and TikTok (“Have you ever looked at sourdough recipes? They’re so complicated!”) — and instead leaned into something simple and sentimental to her: challah bread. Dolly Meckler, founder of Challah Dolly, Photo Credit: Courtesy of Dolly Meckler Meckler’s only prior experience with challah-making stemmed from her days at Jewish summer camp — it wasn’t a family tradition for her — so she found a recipe on The New York Times and got to work baking and braiding in her tiny West Hollywood kitchen. But since baking became a popular pandemic pastime, Meckler had to contend with a yeast shortage in Los Angeles. Thanks to her social media savvy, she was able to leverage her content creation skills to share behind-the-scenes content of her search for yeast in Los Angeles, and of early-day customers coming to pick up her challah loaves, curbside.  Her challah content gained traction and created buzz on social media, which led to Meckler’s bread becoming waitlisted — all orders were placed via Instagram direct messenger.  In the meantime, Meckler was feeling the urge to return to New York City to be with family and friends — she’s a proud New Yorker, through and through, so she headed back to the East Coast and committed to growing her bread business even more. There was already brand awareness, it was just a matter of sprinkling in more strategy and a plan for scaling.  When it came time for branding, Meckler landed on Challah Dolly as the title for this venture, since she’s also the host and creator of a web series, Hello Dolly!, and she hired a friend to create the logo. Challah Dolly round loaves for the Jewish holiday season, Photo Credit: Dolly Meckler She started baking in her Upper East Side kitchen and then when a TimeOut New York feature on Challah Dolly hit in August of 2020 — it helped her bread gain certified street cred in the foodie world. At this point, the challah recipe had taken some twists from the original, and Challah Dolly now uses Meckler’s own formulas for its variations.  The three signature flavors on the site include The Honey Cinnamon, The Everything Seed (“a classic New York City everything bagel staple, reimagined”), and The OG ‘Challah Dolly’. All holiday-inspired round loaves of bread are available through the month of September. Challah Dolly's signature loaves of challah, Photo Credit: Dolly Meckler Meckler knew it was time to level-up and use a larger facility to take her loaves to the big leagues, so she approached a bakery in the Lower East Side about baking her challah loaves temporarily and having a pop-up there. Meckler is a hustler and entrepreneur at heart — and wanted to ensure that everyone could enjoy her challah, especially Jewish families celebrating at the Shabbat table. Today, as a result of the word-of-mouth marketing created by Meckler and her FOMO-inducing Instagram content, Challah Dolly has a direct-to-consumer website as well as a burgeoning wholesale business, and currently outsources the challah-making to a large-scale baking facility in Queens. Challah Dolly ships nationwide, including Hawaii, and its loaves are available at six different retailers in New York City.  “It's about trying new things with challah. It's braided and bold. That's what it's all about,” Meckler asserts.  And since part of the boldness is building hype around challah, Meckler also partnered up with other brands for some limited-edition collabs, including MatchaBar for a matcha-flavored challah and Tony’s Chocolonely for a soft pretzel chocolate challah. Fans of savory challah also enjoyed a pesto parmesan limited drop. What makes Meckler’s story even more extraordinary is that she’s not a trained chef — her primary career focus has always been social media content, strategy and production (she studied television, communications and media, and also has a degree in gender studies). A storyteller and entrepreneur at heart, Meckler knew she had stumbled on something with promise — on several levels.  “It wasn’t a career pivot. It was more of a career shift and an awakening based on my skills. It’s about, how can I apply what I'm good at to this thing? I’ve definitely always valued marketing, and now I understand the value of storytelling and how to communicate with audiences.” At its core, Challah Dolly weaves together Meckler’s passion for storytelling, meeting people and creating content. In this case, “content” in the literal sense and in the sense of “sparking joy.”  Going back to the early days of Challah Dolly, Meckler recalls how much she loved chatting with customers who reached out via DM and came by for curbside pickups. (This speaks to one of her earlier career ambitions of being a talk-show host.) Today, she is sparking up conversations with those who attend IRL pop-ups.  “I have met so many people and heard so many stories through this business and being in this food world. It's been so fun and truly beautiful to meet this whole new group of people that I would have never met before, and hear why they want to buy my bread,” Meckler shares.  The concept of bread bringing people together — whether to pick up loaves in a socially-distanced manner during the peak days of COVID, or enjoying breaking bread together at the dinner table, is what nourishes Meckler.  Her other podcast series, called You Have Such a Pretty Face, shines a light on living in a larger body, overcoming fat phobia, and the beauty of body diversity — and encourages others to “eat the bread, guilt-free.” It focuses on body image and Meckler’s desire to create something fulfilling, especially while she was faced with the looming uncertainty of the pandemic.  “Growing up in a larger body helped shape how I see the world,” Meckler shares. “And so I started to talk about that with other women, including plus-size models and professionals. And it was really shocking how similar all of our stories were. And I realized that talking about it publicly was so healing, because it removed the shame. Challah Dolly’s other mission became about, Don't be scared of carbs. At the root of it all, it’s about making people feel good.” The core ethos of Challah Dolly, Hello Dolly! and You Have Such a Pretty Face is based on bringing people joy — that’s the through line of Meckler’s work. This joy is woven into each Challah Dolly loaf, as well as the content she creates with the podcast and web series. “It’s always been about people,” Meckler asserts. “I've always been interested in people and building relationships with people using different forms of communication.” Challah Dolly even went the accessory route with a deliciously iconic moment: the earring and ear-piercing brand, Studs, created a challah-inspired earring shaped like the braided treat. Meckler lovingly refers to them as “Challah Choops” — they were designed by Garbage NY in honor of the “Studs Loves New York” campaign (as Meckler’s challah was named “the unofficial bread of NYC”).  For a brand that is considered “social-first,” Meckler has come a long way since the early days of searching for yeast in Los Angeles.  “I didn't know what I was doing! And I really had to learn day-by-day and take risks and figure it out,” Meckler shares. “No one said to me, ‘Dolly, you need to scale this thing, from the beginning.’ I called a bakery in New York, who was struggling during COVID to see if they wanted to partner together. I'm very scrappy, in that sense. I wanted to work with another local business to help bring it back. I love this place and I want Challah Dolly to be synonymous with New York — it's this New York brand with this New York soul behind it, who is a hustler, who doesn't take ‘no’ for an answer, and who is going to knock on doors to make it happen.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/karineldor/2021/09/07/how-this-social-media-strategist-is-sparking-joy-with-her-bread-brand-challah-dolly/,"How This Social Media Strategist Is Sparking Joy With Her Bread Brand, Challah Dolly"

The six-team circuit will now be known as the Premier Hockey Federation. “We felt it’s time for our players to be defined by their talent and skill,” commissioner Tyler Tumminia told the Associated Press. “It’s not like they’re female phenomenal. You’re just phenomenal.” With the new slogan “No Labels, No Limits,” the league said in a press release that the PHF name is “inspired by empowerment, gender equity, and inclusivity with respect to differences in the gender identity of current athletes, prospective players, and league stakeholders.” Not all current players in the NWHL identify as female. The rebrand also comes at a time where the league has been changing the way it does business. Founded in 2015, it was the first women’s hockey league to pay players a salary. But some early hiccups, including a sudden 50% pay cut for players early in the league’s second season, caused many of the game’s top players to sour on NWHL participation. Even after the rival Canadian Women’s Hockey League folded at the end of the 2018-19 season, more than 200 players elected to band together as the Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association, with the goal of establishing a sustainable professional league, rather than suit up with the NWHL. Undaunted, the NWHL forged ahead. In the 2019-20 season, the league grew to six teams and expanded into Canada for the first time when the Toronto Six debuted. But the coronavirus pandemic prevented the 2020 Isobel Cup from being awarded. In October of 2020, the league announced a major change of direction. Tumminia, with a primary background as a minor-league baseball executive, took over as interim commissioner, replacing founder Dani Rylan Kearney. The league also announced a new corporate governance model, moving away from its centralized approach where the league owned four of its six franchises. Mimicking major sports leagues such as the NHL, NFL and MLB, the league adopted an unincorporated association structure, with each team represented on a board of governors, and began a shift toward independent ownership of each franchise. Nevertheless, there were highs and lows. With Covid-19 still an issue, the league chose to mount an abbreviated 2020-21 season in a bubble in Lake Placid, New York. Tumminia secured a broadcast deal with NBC Sports Network and a major sponsorship with Discover that was lauded as the largest in the league’s history, reportedly in the $1 million range. The 14-day tournament began on Jan. 23, but Covid-19 concerns eventually caused the Metropolitan Riveters and the Connecticut Whale to choose to drop out. One day before playoffs were scheduled to begin, the season was suspended. Nearly two months later, it was re-started at Warrior Arena in Boston. On March 27, the Boston Pride lifted the Isobel Cup.

The 2021-22 PHF season is set to get underway on Nov. 6, with all six teams back in their home arenas in front of fans for a 20-game, 19-week schedule.  As for the new name and branding, “This disassociates us from any negativity or negative perception that may have been there,” Riveters captain Madison Packer, who has been with the NWHL since its inaugural season, told the Associated Press. “As these changes continue to occur and we re-establish ourselves, a lot of the players are the same, a lot of the structure looks the same, but it’s different. It’s a new improved model of what we had before.” “This rebrand strategy speaks volumes about what women in sports and women, in general, are trying to do,” said Boston Pride sophomore forward Sammy Davis, the first overall pick in the 2020 NWHL Draft. “We’re trying to be seen for more than just being women. It’s important to be pioneers, to be first. Set the foundation and show people that it’s okay to be different and it’s okay to want change.” Last week, Canada won gold over the United States at the 2021 Women’s World Championship in Calgary — a tournament that came after the cancellation of both the 2020 edition and the original 2021 dates, which had been set for last May. From here, most of the game’s top players will be centralized with their national teams for the better part of the next six months, preparing for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. In early August, the PWHPA announced details for its 2021-22 Dream Gap Tour. Once again, players will train in five hubs across Canada and the United States and participate in showcase events with prize pots and bragging rights on the line. While the Olympians may not be able to be as involved in on-ice activities, many are expected to remain involved with the association as supporting members. The first Dream Gap Tour showcase of the season is set for Nov. 12-14 in Truro, Nova Scotia.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolschram/2021/09/07/goodbye-nwhl-hello-premier-hockey-federation/,"Goodbye, NWHL. Hello, Premier Hockey Federation."
"Call Of Duty: Vanguard Last week, I spent a little over two hours playing several of Call Of Duty: Vanguard’s upcoming multiplayer maps with other members of the press and influencers/streamers/pros some of whom were much, much better than me—though I think I held my own at times. We played several different modes on four different maps which I’ll go into more detail about below. First, let’s talk about the modes, gunplay and overall feel of the upcoming WW2 shooter from Sledgehammer Games. Since I didn’t have access to all 16 MP maps or all modes and wasn’t able to try out all the different guns, these impressions are obviously limited. Sledgehammer and Activision had us play several different modes. Some you’re probably familiar with like Domination (capture and hold three points) and Kill Confirmed (TDM with dog-tags you have to collect). The only new mode we played was Patrol, which is basically Hardpoint but the point moves constantly across the map on what’s essentially an invisible track. Patrol mode is a fun new twist that I really did enjoy. You can never hunker down and defend a stationary point since it’s always moving, so it’s a much more active game mode than Hardpoint. Enemies can come at you from all sides and you can get the jump on defenders. It’s all very chaotic. I played these modes in 6v6 and big team mode. Vanguard has a slightly confusing new “combat pacing” system that’s really just a fancy way of determining what size teams you want on any given map. Combat Pacing goes something like this:   We played Tactical and Blitz during the demo session. Tactical is your classic 6v6 gameplay which is my preference when it comes to Call of Duty games (unless we’re talking about special modes like Gunfight or War Mode which I like even more). 6v6 works pretty well on the smaller maps, but at least one during the demo session (Red Star) was too big for such a small player count. Later, we played it on Blitz mode and that felt too chaotic. Maybe “Assault” will be just right. We shall see. Gunplay felt pretty decent. The game is built on the same engine as Modern Warfare so there are a lot of similarities with things like double-sprint and just the way the game feels overall. It might be a bit faster and a bit less grounded—Modern Warfare has a clunky realism to it that’s basically the opposite of Cold War’s fast arcade style. I’d say Vanguard falls somewhere in the middle. Call Of Duty: Vanguard The guns, of course, are quite different. These are all WW2-themed guns, though the basics all still apply. You have your sniper rifles, your super-fast revolving shotgun, your SMGs and Assault Rifles, and the M1 Garand as a Tactical Rifle (at least that was the only one I recall seeing during the demo). The M1 Garand is a classic rifle but I didn’t use it much, sticking mainly with Assault Rifles and devoting one entire match to sniping. The other new addition to multiplayer is destructible walls. These are very obvious as they’re essentially just boards instead of actual walls. You can fire or slide or melee these to pieces, opening up new routes or taking down some enemies who mistakenly think they have cover. It’s basically the barest of bare minimums when it comes to destructible environments and I think it adds very little to the game and can in fact be somewhat distracting—though not as bad as in Champion Hill mode where spawn kills were a direct result. Overall, I had fun with the online multiplayer session but I’m not sold on the experience as a whole yet. Partly this is because I’m used to Black Ops Cold War at this point and nothing in Vanguard felt as good or as natural, including the maps. So let’s look at those next. One thing I’ll say for the four maps we had a chance to play during our sessions is that they were all very different from one another. This is in contrast to the Champion Hill mode, where the maps felt starkly similar, especially in terms of color palette which was all brown and grey and army green. Those maps made it very hard to see enemy players. In the MP session, this was not really an issue. EAGLE’S NEST Eagle's Nest Eagle’s Nest—Hitler’s famous alpine base—was the smallest of the four maps we played. It’s comprised of a compound and basically three lanes. The left lane skirts the compound with a wooden walkway or a more open outdoor corridor that passes by the windows and walkways leading inside. The right lane is a long outdoor hallway perfect for sniping from either side. Most of the action takes place inside, however. There are a series of medium-sized rooms to fight through, with lots of exits and entrances on either side. This is a pretty chaotic map since most of the engagements are close-quarters. I will say, I didn’t love the flow on this one but I didn’t hate it, either. GAVUTU Gavutu Gavutu is a small South Pacific island map. It has lots of winding paths, a long open central lane perfect for sniper battles, and several compounds to explore. In a Domination map, the A and C points are both on the beach while Bravo is inside the largest compound. Here, a tank on a platform raises up and down from the roof to the interior where the point is, which is an interesting wrinkle. I liked this map quite a lot. It’s medium-to-large but at least in Objective-based modes I think it works pretty well even in 6v6. This was the first map we played on and we played in Patrol mode. You can watch the entire Patrol match in the video I made below: HOTEL ROYAL Hotel Royale Another medium-sized map, Hotel Royal is mostly an interior map, but includes lanes around both sides and a rooftop to battle on. Two atriums adorn the roof and you can break the glass and drop in on unsuspecting enemies from above. Inside you’ll find plenty of cover, with bars and lots of different rooms to hide in. This was a pretty fun map, though I admit I played rather poorly on it for whatever reason. Sometimes you’re on your game, sometimes you’re not. RED STAR Red Star By far the largest of the maps we played, Red Star is a sprawling courtyard surrounded by large buildings, most of which you can enter. Second or third-story perches provide lots of opportunities for snipers, as do open rooftops. This mode can work in 6v6 but only with Objective modes. In TDM this will feel way too empty. I also played Blitz on this with something like 24 players on each team. It was . . . chaotic to say the least. Aesthetically I enjoyed this map, but it’s awfully big for a Call of Duty map. Graphically, Vanguard looks fine but it’s nothing awe-inspiring. Modern Warfare had a somewhat colorless palette but it worked in its own way, evoking a realism that gave the game a distinct feel. Black Ops Cold War completely dropped realism in favor of bright colors and diverse locations. This made it easier to spot enemies and added to the game’s more arcadey experience. I didn’t like it as much at first, but it grew on me and I now prefer it to Modern Warfare’s drab presentation. Vanguard, once again, falls somewhere in-between. It’s not as drab as Modern Warfare but it’s not quite as colorful as Cold War.  Speaking of Cold War, Treyarch did some cool things with that game that are scrapped in Vanguard, including the much larger control points in modes like Dom and Control and Hardpoint. I really liked those changes, but we’re back to much smaller points here. I’m also a little bummed out that Killstreaks are back instead of Scorestreaks. Killstreaks penalize Objective-based play and reward getting kills. Players like me who throw themselves on the objective every time die too much to get many Killstreaks. The only time I got all of mine in a single match was when I ignored the Dom points and played as a sniper. That’s a weird incentive. Since Killstreaks reset on death, you’re just screwed. I prefer Cold War’s algorithm, which rewards staying alive but doesn’t reset a streak on death. Here are the Killstreaks we know of:   The mini-map is the same as Modern Warfare’s, meaning it won’t reveal players as red dots on the map when they fire with unsuppressed weapons. There’s a Radar perk that turns this function back on, but of course that takes away from other useful Perks. I’m not sure why we’re reverting to this system which simply takes vital information away from players, but I suspect it’s to even the playing field a bit, hamstringing better players in favor of casuals. All told, I had a fun time with Vanguard’s multiplayer but I’ll need to spend a lot more time with it to really get a full sense of what to expect from this game. The gunplay feels pretty good and there’s a wide array of guns to choose from. Since Gunsmith is back, you’ll be able to customize to your heart’s content with all number of attachment combinations to choose from. With a couple Beta weekends coming up, we’ll have plenty of time to dig into the game further, try out more weapons and really get a feel for Vanguard’s gameplay loop.

"Impeachment: American Crime Story — Pictured: Beanie Fieldstein as Monica Lewinsky. CR. Kurt ... [+] Iswarienko/FX  When the impeachment trial of the 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton, was in the media every day, Beanie Feldstein was just a small child. In fact, the actress was merely five years old at the time. Now, she’s portraying one of the central figures in the story, Monica Lewinsky, in the limited series Impeachment: American Crime Story.  The narrative of the piece tells the story of the proceedings, and what led up to them, through the eyes of the women at the center of the events – Linda Tripp, Paula Jones, and Lewinsky. All three were thrust into the public spotlight during a time of corrosive partisan rancor, shifting sexual politics, and a changing media landscape.  Feldstein says that while the time she spent with the real Lewinsky was limited, it was informative in a unique way. “Monica and I had one in-person meeting before the Coronavirus. We had a beautiful kind of ‘get to know you, and because of Coronavirus, she was not able to be as present on set, so, honestly, we had more of a friendship than we do a working relationship.” She says that when she received the scripts for the series she got a ‘great gift’ because, “I knew that every word that I was saying was approved and had been to Monica first. By the time it got to me, I was sure that everything in there was something that she felt comfortable with, she felt was real to her life, and felt represented her.”  Executive Producer Nina Jacobson says of the importance of Lewinsky’s involvement in the series, “Monica did not have a voice during this entire, really, unbelievably overwhelming series of events that happened. So, to have been silenced and really culturally banished for 20 years, there was no way we could make this show and not give her a voice. It would have felt utterly wrong.” The undertaking was challenging for Lewinsky, as well as the creative team says Jacobson, because, “[With] the demands of a narrative and true-life events, you're always having to find the balance of how to drive your narrative forward while staying true to the emotional truth and, in our case, a heavily documented series of events. So, [Lewinsky’s] contributions were invaluable. It was not easy for her, and it was not always easy for us, but it was worth every moment.” Fellow Executive Producer Brad Simpson adds that Lewinsky was, “was really respectful in the process, in terms of [the] other characters. Obviously, this is Monica's story, but we're showing a tapestry of characters [in the narrative.]” Because she was too young to take in what happened in real-time, Feldstein said that she, “was as about as blank of a slate as you could possibly have, given that this is such a known story and it's a huge American historical moment. Because of my age at the time, I was really taking this in for the first time. So, in that way, I didn't have my own preconceived notions. I understand completely what we were up against as far as what people thought of [Monica Lewinsky] at the time. It was deeply important to me to unravel that and redeem her.” She says that she learned that Lewinsky is, “a deeply loyal person, deeply loyal to everyone that she comes in contact with,” and that the series delves into her familial relationships as well as her previous romantic relationships, examining just how those contributed to her involvement with Clinton and the aftermath of that interaction.  It’s because of this loyalty that Feldstein feels Lewinsky connected with another central figure who plays a crucial role in Lewinsky’s life, Linda Tripp. She explains, saying, “I think Linda is actually quite charismatic. That's very important to understanding why these two developed such a deep relationship - they're taken with one another, and so really [in Impeachment] the central relationship is not Monica and Bill. The central relationship is Monica and Linda. It's the story of their coming together, their discovery of one another, and then their eventual parting ways, of course, with this huge, unbelievable betrayal.” Overall, it was a life-changing experience for Feldstein to play this role she says. “I have never been given an experience like that to portray, that dramatic, one that is also someone's life. It was incredibly taxing, but it was the most rewarding experience I've ever had as an actor.”  ‘Impeachment: American Crime Story’ airs Tuesdays at 10pm e/p on FX.

"An electric Toyota bZ4X SUV on display at the Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition. Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, plans to spend more than $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop batteries and the underlying supply chain to catch competitors in the growing market for electric cars and trucks. While the Japanese automaker led the industry in the technology of hybrid gasoline-electric hybrids, it is working hard to bring its first all-electric vehicle lineup to market next year. The company said it wants to slash the cost of its batteries by at least 30%, primarily by looking for lower cost materials and a more efficient way to structure its battery cells.  “For the vehicle, we aim to improve power consumption, which is an indicator of the amount of electricity used per kilometer by 30%, starting with the Toyota bZ4X,” said Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda, citing a new compact SUV expected to be launched soon.  Another goal is to set up 70 electric vehicle battery lines by 2030 capable of producing 200 gigawatt hours of battery power. A gigawatt hour is equivalent to one million kilowatt hours.  According to Reuters, Toyota is specifically focused on producing solid-state batteries, which are more energy dense than the liquid lithium-ion batteries used in many EVs currently available. Solid state batteries are less susceptible to catching fire.  The company also plans to use solid-state batteries in its future gasoling-electric hybrids, including the Prius.  Toyota wants to sell 8 million partially or fully electrified vehicles by 2030, of which about 2 million will by powered entirely by batteries or fuel cells. The other 6 million will be gasoline-electric hybrids or plug-in hybrids. Volkswagen said Tuesday it may have to spend more than previously announced to achieve its goals in the areas of autonomous driving and electric vehicles. The German automaker has already said it plans to spend 150 billion euros ($178 billion) by 2025 on the transformation to electric propulsion.  VW plans to produce batteries at six new plants by 2030 with a capacity of 240 gigawatt hours.  General Motors

"Viral science fiction romance Ice Planet Barbarians by Ruby Dixon, the first in a series, will be ... [+] published in print in November by Berkley, with a print edition of Dixon's Barbarian Alien to follow in January. The series went viral on TikTok, with the publisher crediting user Emma Carter for highlighting the series, which features blue aliens. Science fiction romance novel Ice Planet Barbarians by Ruby Dixon, which was originally self-published in 2015, will be published in print by Berkley on November 30, with new exclusive content, after its viral success. The book saw an influx of purchasers and new fans after TikTok user Emma Carter posted on May 22 of this year about the book, using hashtags such as #smuttok and #spicybooktok about the book (BookTok is the term used by those who post about books on TikTok).  CNN write in June that in the weeks following Carter’s initial post, “IPB books started popping up on Amazon's 
  
  AMZN 
  Sci-Fi and Romance bestseller lists, occasionally even taking the top spots. The first few books in the series have also cracked Amazon's overall Kindle bestseller list.” For the week of June 13th, Amazon Advisor noted that Ice Planet Barbarians had reached the fifth most-sold book on Amazon, with Barbarian Alien hitting the 11th spot. There’s also been a demand for merchandise related to the series; 215 items using “Ice Planet Barbarians” appear on Etsy, including a t-shirt that reads “I like my aliens big blue and ribbed.” The series also has its own Wiki, which also covers other books set in the same universe. Carter said in a statement of the response to her viral post, “I was tagged in at least ten videos an hour for over a week. The sheer number of people reading and reviewing these books was astonishing. A few of my friends on BookTok made videos too and when I saw the likes and views they were getting I was blown away. When the first book hit #1 on e-book bestseller lists, I realized the power BookTok has.” Ice Planet Barbarians is the first in an ongoing series, which currently has 22 titles such as Barbarian’s Prize and Having the Barbarian’s Baby, as well as two spinoff series and eight novellas. Of the new print edition, on her website, Dixon wrote, “This cover (and the special bonus epilogue) will only be available in the print edition. Also included in the print edition – Georgie & Vektal’s honeymoon novella. It’s like an extra-complete version and I can’t wait for everyone to see it.” In January, Berkley will also publish a print edition of Dixon’s Barbarian Alien. In a statement, Dixon said, “It was amazing to see how the organic word of mouth lead so many new readers to my books. I knew a publisher partner could help me satisfy the existing reader desire for physical books and allow me to introduce the series to a whole new audience of print readers. I immediately thought of Berkley as the right partner.” Of the print partnership, Cindy Hwang, Berkley Vice President adn Editorial Director, said in a statement, “I’ve followed this addictively entertaining series for some time and when Ruby approached us about partnering with her, I was thrilled at the opportunity to bring these books to an even broader audience.” Of the success of the series, Carter told CNN in June, “There's no shame when you read. Some people may look at the shirtless men on the covers and think this is the most outlandish, disgusting thing you can read. But all it took was one person, saying with their whole chest, 'I like these books.' And then all of a sudden, other people are reading it. They're liking it. They're saying, 'Oh, this is really good,' too.” Dixon noted to CNN the communal nature of the discussions on TikTok that helped foster sales, saying, “[TikTok] is a totally different vibe than the traditional reviews that books get. Readers love making fan art. They love discussing books and getting their friends to read things. It's such a strong, creative community.” BookTok has become so popular that retailers such as Barnes & Noble

"Katy (Awkwafina) and Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios. ©Marvel Studios 2021.  As entirely expected, Walt Disney undersold the opening weekend estimates for Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. For the record, every studio has done this for as long as I’ve been tracking domestic box office. If the lower guestimate gets you the good press or the “We won!” media narrative on Sunday, why not go with that and then get another day of “We really won!” coverage on Monday morning? Despite not unreasonable mostly Covid-specific concerns that it would open below “normal” for an MCU movie, the Simu Liu/Awkwafina/Tony Leung/Michelle Yeoh opened with a $75.5 million Fri-Sun/$94.7 million Fri-Mon holiday haul. That’s not only arguably a best-case-scenario debut on a Covid curve, it’s pretty damn good for a non-sequel MCU movie even in conventional circumstances.  The martial arts flick opened with a Fri-Sun debut 2/3 smaller than Black Panther ($202 million in early 2018) and 52% smaller than Captain Marvel ($154 million in early 2019), but those were exceptions to the MCU rule. Prior to Black Panther, the biggest solo MCU origin story flicks were Iron Man ($102 million in 2008) and Doctor Strange ($85 million in 2016). If we compare other “new” MCU movies, Shang-Chi nabbed an opening right in between the $55-$65 million likes of Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and Ant-Man and the $88-$102 million likes of Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange. We can debate to what extent Black Widow ($80 million in 2021) and Spider-Man: Homecoming ($117 million in 2017) were “new.”  Ben Schwartz in 'Sonic the Hedgehog' and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in 'Bad Boys For Life' The film also earned $19.3 million on Monday. That’s five times what Halloween earned ($4.2 million) on Labor Day 2007. It’s 2.7x the $6.9 million day-four and $7.2 million day-four grosses of F9 and Black Widow. It’s more than double the $9.4 million Memorial Day Monday of A Quiet Place part II and almost double the over/under $11 million holiday Monday grosses of Bad Boys for Life and Sonic the Hedgehog in early 2020. Its Monday gross that’s almost tied with the film’s pure Friday gross ($29.6 million minus $8.8 million in Thursday previews) while pushing the film’s global cume over $150 million. It puts Shang-Chi’s four-day debut right in line with the Fri-Sun debuts of some of the MCU’s biggest breakout hits, even when adjusted for inflation.  Yes, four days is one more than day than three days, and Monday falling on a holiday slanted the Monday grosses accordingly. But, especially when dealing with a much-anticipated film opening on a holiday day, the folks who showed up over the long weekend almost certainly would have shown up within the confines of a traditional Fri-Sun weekend had Monday been a work/school day. Most who flocked to Deadpool over its $152 million Fri-Mon President’s Day weekend in 2016 would have done so had it opened in a conventional Fri-Sun weekend. Ditto the $158 million Thurs-Sun debut of Revenge of the Sith (including a record $50 million Thursday) in 2005 or the $128 million Wed-Sun debut of Shrek 2 (including a $108 million Fri-Sun gross) in 2004.  'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' Yes, breakouts like Baby Driver or Knives Out arguably increased their long-weekend multipliers due to buzz. However Shang-Chi’s four day debut is essentially tied with the $96 million Fri-Mon Veteran's Day weekend debut ($85 million Fri-Sun) of Thor: The Dark World in 2013. It topped the four-day cumes of Ant-Man and the Wasp ($77 million Fri-Sun/$88 million Fri-Mon in 2018) and Black Widow ($80 million/$87 million in 2021) while nearing Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95 million/$101 million in 2014). Among Marvel’s non-sequels, Shang-Chi’s four-day gross is behind only Iron Man ($102 million/$109 million in 2008), Guardians of the Galaxy ($94 million/$106 million in 2014), Black Panther ($202 million/$242 million in 2018), Captain Marvel ($154 million/$164 million in 2019) and Spider-Man: Homecoming ($117 million/$129 million).  It’s almost tied with the “tickets sold” four-day cume of Doctor Strange ($91 million in 2016 and $98 million adjusted-for-inflation). Even with Covid variables, the lack of an A-level property and the comparative lack of “everyone in America knows who they are” movie stars (and, yes, it’s unfortunately easier in pop culture for white actors to become “general audience-famous”), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings still pulled in opening grosses on par with a mid-level Marvel movie. A $94.5 million Fri-Mon debut would have been, until just three years ago, a top-of-the-line for a non-sequel “origin story” solo MCU flick. Moreover, Shang-Chi had an almost identical four-day multiplier (3.17x from a $29.6 million Friday) to Black Panther (3.18 x from a $76 million Friday) is beyond encouraging.  Chadwick Boseman in 'Black Panther' Ditto the “made almost as much on Monday as Friday” factor. Black Panther earned $51 million in pure Friday grosses ($76 million minus $25 million in previews) and then $40 million on President’s Day. Even if it’s way too early to even hope for similar post-debut legs (which would mean $273 million domestic, natch),the size of the Monday gross (66% of the Friday gross) compared to the Fri-Sun grosses is closer to Black Panther (52%) than Thor: The Dark World (31%). Yes, more kids are in school/adults at work for Veteran's Day than Labor Day. Yes, the Simu Liu-led flick could dive bomb today and could take a second-weekend drop closer to Black Widow (-69%) than Iron Man (-49%). However, the odds are in its favor.  Credit, for now, strong reviews, the Marvel brand as a “one ring to rule them all” moviegoing option for many theatrical moviegoers, positive buzz, the “marketing undersold the film” factor, the demographically-specific “event movie” variable and the lack of tentpole competition until Venom: Let There Be Carnage on October 1. Black Panther earned 82% of its $700 million cume by its 28th day, so a month is enough time to run the tables. Let’s see how leggy Shang-Chi can be with a shortened 45-day theatrical window, which by the way is what Bob Chapek meant when he referred to Shang-Chi’s release as an experiment. Shang-Chi may not be the next Black Panther in terms of global grosses, but it might yet be just that in terms of domestic legs.

"English actress Hayley Mills as identical twins Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers in the Walt Disney ... [+] comedy 'The Parent Trap', 1961. (Photo by Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images) Actress Hayley Mills might just be the real world’s most unintentional “Peter Pan” and for being a Disney darling pretty much her entire life, the irony of that could not be more fitting. Yes, Mills is a grown woman today, but the English actress was never truly “allowed” to grow up in the eyes of much of society, as many still only see her as her beloved Pollyanna character or as those clever twins from The Parent Trap these sixty years later. “My career happened terribly quickly and it took me by surprise and astonished everybody else,” Mills reveals to me at Forbes. “Nobody was expecting it. I was just a very ordinary little girl. I wanted to ride my pony and hang around with my brother and climb trees and all those things and suddenly, I was in Hollywood. It was great but it took a lot of adjusting for the whole family.” After she took a nostalgic walk down memory lane about five years ago at the Disney offices looking at archives from her early career, Mills, 75, is now ready to speak out about the highs and lows of her Hollywood journey in the form of a new memoir appropriately titled Forever Young. Even though she is remembered by moviegoers as this confident, adventurous and wildly talkative presence on-screen, in reality, the young Mills often times felt much the opposite.  “I think what was really difficult was that when I was going through adolescence, I became terribly, terribly shy and terribly insecure. I was really lacking in confidence. That made it difficult and it was such a waste of time. I look back now and I think Ugh, what a waste of time, but that’s part of life, isn’t it? That’s part of growing up. A lot of people have the same experience. I really did find going to social occasions torture. I was alright with some people and I was alright sometimes. That was the weird thing about it. As I say in the book, I’d be absolutely fine and then suddenly this monster from the deep would like wrap its tentacles around my ankles and suck me down into the slime and I was inarticulate with shyness and people probably thought that I was just rude or stupid or stuck-up or something like that, but there we are. That’s all part of the journey we’re on, isn’t it? When we are trying to find out who we are and we leave childhood behind, when life was so simple and we lived in the moment.” Hayley Mills memoir 'Forever Young' In Forever Young, Mills talks about the fun she had filming Disney classics like The Parent Trap, in which Mills played side-by-side twin characters Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick, a filmmaking trick in the early 1960s that she explains in great detail in her memoir. When I asked Mills if there was anyone on-set she wishes she would have had more conversations with or things she would have done differently while filming The Parent Trap, Mills playfully reveals exactly what she would have changed, especially during her iconic “Let’s Get Together” musical number. “I would spend a lot more time with Leon Charles, who was the dialogue coach, and I would spend a lot more time on my accents, which wandered about between each twin in the most alarming way (laughs). I’m surprised I got away with it, actually. And I think also I would have worked harder on my guitar playing and piano playing, which were dreadful. Yes, those three things I would definitely go back and sort out. My sons play the guitar, two of my grandsons play the guitar and they think that it is absolutely appalling.” Like many child actors at the time, Mills was under contract with Disney with a five-year contract. During her quick rise to Hollywood stardom, Walt Disney became a supportive friend and adviser to Mills, guidance early on in her career that she remembers fondly and discusses candidly in her book. Even though he passed away in 1966 after her contract with Disney had ended, I asked Mills what she would say to Walt Disney today, looking back on her experiences with him and seeing how her life & career have played out ever since.  14th December 1961: American film producer Walt Disney talking to British actress Hayley Mills on ...

Well first of all, I’d tell him I loved him because I never did tell him that I loved him and I hope he knew it. And I would thank him so much for giving me a career and caring so much about finding the right projects for me as he thought fit. I got some interesting things offered to me and they were not considered appropriate. They didn’t gel with the Disney image at all and nowadays, young actors have a lot more freedom because being under contract is not quite the same as it was then.” As years went by and life continued on for Mills into adulthood, she began seeking out roles that could set her apart from her well-known Disney persona. Mills found a great love for theatre in her later years, a performing outlet that she says gave her the opportunity to play all kinds of things she had never done before. Mills is also quite memorable to younger generations for her starring role as teacher Carrie Bliss on Good Morning, Miss Bliss, a short-lived comedy sitcom in the late 1980s with her relatively unknown young co-stars at the time Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dustin Diamond and Lark Voorhies which would eventually evolve into the popular Saved By The Bell series. Lark Voorhies, Heather Hopper, Dustin Diamond, Hayley Mills, Max Battimo and Mark-Paul Gosselaar in ... [+] 'Good Morning, Miss Bliss' “That was the first time that I’d worked in television like that,” Mills continues. “It’s very challenging with the script being re-written all the time, right up to recording time. That’s really hard. The kids were so quick and good and learned things in the twinkling of an eye. I do think that kind of television falls between two stools, between the kind of focus they can give when you make a film and the theatre because it’s so kind of off the top of your head and I was aware that it was only too easy to fall back on old things that you’d done before. Old tricks.” While many fans of Mills might think that she must have been financially set for life early on following her very successful childhood years with Disney, she has actually spent much of her adult life in legal battles surrounding her trust fund. When Mills turned 21, she was granted access to her trust, but her savings was given a 91% tax rate by the Inland Revenue to help build the United Kingdom back up following the war. Mills says she was able to really rehash those difficult memories around that whole ordeal while she worked with her son Crispian to write this memoir.  “I didn’t realize how much money I would’ve had or I had forgotten because what you’ve never had, you don’t miss and that really was true as far as I was concerned. I wasn’t bemoaning and bewailing. The one thing that it would have given me that would have been very valuable was the freedom to say no and the freedom so I wouldn’t have to go off and work, do something I didn’t particularly want to do but I had to because I had to earn a living and so that would’ve been nice.” Hayley Mills Even though her life has been an elaborate story all its own, Mills is hopeful that readers of her memoir will be able to connect with her experiences and struggles of growing up. “Everybody goes through it, don’t they? I mean, it is a universal experience. Adolescence, puberty, self-consciousness, weight gain, insecurity, self-doubt, all those things. Everybody can identify with that and even though my life was quite extraordinary in many respects, the situation I was in working in my career, my human, personal, private experience was exactly the same as everybody. So, I hope that people will relate and they’ll understand it and see themselves.” As I wrapped up my conversation with Mills, who is just as captivatingly authentic as you would hope she would be today, I had one final question for the life-long actress and now eloquent author, forever seen as the girl who dazzles us moviegoers, generation after generation: If you could go back to the little Hayley Mills who had just landed her first Disney breakout role in Pollyanna and give her advice after all that you have experienced throughout your life up until now, what would you tell your former self? Hayley takes a moment to think and responds with, “I think I would say don’t waste time. Don’t waste time being negative. Live in the moment. Embrace it all. Be grateful.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2021/09/07/disney-icon-hayley-mills-is-ready-to-tell-her-extraordinary-life-story/,Disney Icon Hayley Mills Is Ready To Tell Her ‘Extraordinary’ Life Story
"Hyundai is developing technology for a hydrogen-powered Trailer Drone, a nonpolluting, robotic truck. Hyundai Motor, which is readying a new line of battery-powered vehicles, says hydrogen is essential for cutting carbon emissions from transportation, especially heavy-duty trucks, and intends to roll out a cheaper, smaller fuel cell system to power every commercial vehicle model it makes—as well as drones, emergency vehicles, homes, trains, ships and a sports car.  The Korean industrial giant, which has previously committed billions of dollars to commercialize hydrogen-powered trucks, said it will introduce a next-generation fuel cell system in 2023 that’s 50% cheaper, 30% smaller and twice as powerful as the current version. Every truck, bus and commercial vehicle it produces will also be offered with a fuel cell powertrain by 2028, and the company said its hydrogen-power system will reach cost parity with battery packs by 2030. “Countries and companies are developing feasible carbon-neutral solutions to help combat global warming. Hyundai Motor Group’s solution to this problem is to encourage a shift in the energy paradigm to hydrogen,” Group Chairman Euisun Chung said today in a video presentation. “Hydrogen is a powerful solution to combating climate change.”  Hyundai joins automotive and trucking rivals including Toyota, Hino, General Motors, Daimler, Volvo, Cummins and newer upstarts such Nikola and Hyzon in lining up behind hydrogen as a better electric-vehicle option for heavy, long-range vehicles than batteries owing to weight savings and faster refueling. Yet big challenges remain: the technology has to overcome high costs for fuel cells stacks and hydrogen tanks that make the vehicles more expensive than those powered by carbon-based fuels or batteries. Additionally, the supply of “green” hydrogen fuel sourced from renewable energy and water, or sourced from waste materials, needs to expand dramatically to ensure maximum carbon reduction.  Hyundai's next-generation fuel cell modules are 50% cheaper, 30% smaller and twice as powerful as its current version. Fuel-cell and battery-powered vehicles are both electric, sharing the same motors and many other components. The key difference is batteries store electricity and fuel cells make it onboard as needed, in an electrochemical process that extracts electrons from hydrogen forced through fuel-cell membranes. Aside from electricity, the only byproduct is water vapor. Beyond cars and trucks, they’ve been used by NASA for decades, they work as stationary electricity generators and are being developed to power trains and even ships and ferries.  The U.S. Energy Department hosted its first “Hydrogen Shot Summit” on Aug. 31 and is promoting the fuel, along with batteries and renewable energy as key tools in the battle against climate change.  The fuel can be “be a multi-trillion-dollar global market in the coming decades, and industry estimates that the U.S. could build 700,000 jobs in the hydrogen economy just by 2030,” John Kerry, President Joe Biden’s Special Envoy for Climate said in remarks at the conference. “Hydrogen offers a way to bridge the gap between the clean energy technologies we have today, such as wind, solar, nuclear, hydro and geothermal power, with the vast set of end uses of energy that aren’t yet hooked up to the power grid today.” Hyundai’s big hydrogen push follows plans by Toyota to start making fuel cell modules at its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant in 2023 for use in commercial vehicles, and Nikola’s fuel cell partnership with Bosch that includes making the power units at the company’s new Arizona plant, also in 2023. General Motors plans to make its “Hydrotec” fuel cells for trucks at a factory in Michigan in a partnership that includes Honda.  Its new fuel cell modules will be produced in 100- and 200-kilowatt variations. It also wants to use the technology for “trams, trains, ships and urban air mobility,” Chung said and exploring options to use hydrogen for non-transportation applications including home and building power systems and in power plants. Hyundai said in late 2018 it would spend nearly $7 billion on efforts to commercialize hydrogen technology, aiming to produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles powered by the fuel annually by 2030.  During the video presentation, Chung showed off a hydrogen-powered, autonomous Trailer Drone, the company’s idea for a clean, robotic truck. Hyundai is working on concepts for emergency vehicles, a rescue drone and the Vision FK, a future high-performance, rear-wheel-drive sports car that accelerates from 0-60 mph in under four seconds.  “We have long understood the tremendous potential of hydrogen energy, so over the past 20 years we have devoted significant resources and talents to developing hydrogen-based technologies,” Chung said. “Our vision is to apply hydrogen energy in all areas of life and industry.”  The Vision FK concept sports car.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/09/07/hyundai-making-big-hydrogen-push-with-cheaper-fuel-cells/,"Hyundai Making Big Hydrogen Push With Cheaper Fuel Cells For Trucks, Drones And Sports Car"
"Jason Miller, a former top aide to former President Donald Trump who runs the pro-Trump social media platform Gettr, confirmed reports he was detained and questioned by police in Brazil on Tuesday after he reportedly met with President Jair Bolsonaro.

(Michael Reynolds/Pool via AP) Miller told Forbes in a statement he and others he was traveling with for the Conservative Political Action Conference in Brazil were “questioned for three hours” at an airport in the capital city of Brasilia. Miller claimed he was “not accused of any wrongdoing” and that police told him they only “‘wanted to talk,’” adding that he told the officers he had “nothing to say” and was later released to fly back to the U.S. Miller was detained by Brazilian federal police as part of an investigation into “anti-democratic acts” after meeting with Bolsonaro, according to Brazilian news outlet Metrópoles, which first reported the development. According to the outlet, the order to question Miller came from Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre De Moraes, who in August opened an investigation into unproven claims by Bolsonaro that Brazil’s federal elections in 2022 will be rife with fraud. Forbes has reached out to Miller and the Brazilian police for comment.

[+] Seoul on September 1, 2020. - K-pop sensation BTS has become the first all-South Korean act to rule the top US singles chart, industry tracker Billboard announced on August 31, with their English-language ""Dynamite"" hitting number one. (Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) BTS have no trouble scoring a hit single whenever they want these days, as they have one of the largest fan bases in the business and now they also have the institutional support to turn any of their tunes into proper smashes. With “Butter,” the South Korean band didn’t just want to reach the top of the charts, but to rule through an entire season, and Billboard has just confirmed that the group has accomplished this feat in spectacular fashion. The music magazine and chart company has announced that BTS’s “Butter” has officially been declared the Song of the Summer for 2021, earning one of the most prestigious and coveted titles in the U.S. music industry. This latest win marks not only the septet’s first time coming out on top in the running, but also their first time landing inside the top 10 on the end-of-season list. “Butter” debuted atop the seasonal Songs of the Summer chart on the ranking dated June 26, the first frame the tally was updated in 2021. The smash didn’t vacate the throne for the rest of the tracking period, making it an easy champion.  By the time Billboard reinstated the Songs of the Summer chart, “Butter” had already controlled the Hot 100 for three previous turns, and it was still just getting started. The track debuted atop the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. with ease in early June and ended up ruling for nine nonconsecutive stints, only stepping aside as another BTS single, “Permission to Dance,” also opened in first place. The Songs of the Summer chart is compiled in a similar fashion as the Hot 100, combining sales, streaming and radio play data to paint a picture of which tracks dominated the warmest months of the year. “Butter” was a success when it came to streaming platforms (it peaked at No. 4 on the Streaming Songs chart) and at radio (it rose as high as No. 20 on the all-genre Radio Songs tally), but its pure purchases that really helped make the tune a winner. BTS’s smash claims nine of the 10 largest sales weeks of 2021, and it has led the Digital Song Sales chart for a history-making 14 frames (so far). The announcement came just a short time before Billboard also revealed that “Butter” has returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a tenth nonconsecutive week, bouncing from No. 7 to the peak spot once again. Coming in behind “Butter” on the ranking of the top 10 songs of the summer are mega hits like “Good 4 U” by Olivia Rodrigo (No. 2), Dua Lipa's ""Levitating"" (No. 3), Doja Cat and SZA's ""Kiss Me More"" (No. 4) and The Weeknd and Ariana Grande's ""Save Your Tears"" (No. 5). In the past few years, the title of Song of the Summer has been bestowed upon hit singles like “Rockstar” by DaBaby and Roddy Ricch (2020), “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X (2019), “In My Feelings” by Drake (2018) and “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber (2017).

For a while the tune consistently dipped, week after week, but now it’s rocketed back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. “Butter” shoots from No. 7 to No. 1 on this week’s Hot 100, improving thanks to an enormous sales frame. The summer smash lifts thanks to the release of a new must-hear remix that features Megan Thee Stallion. Her involvement helped introduce her fan base to the all-pop tune, and it gave BTS fans another reason to stream and click purchase on digital storefronts like iTunes and Amazon

 . BTS’s current success sold an amazing 143,000 copies in the past tracking frame, which easily makes it the bestselling in the nation once again. The tune also racked up 10.7 million streams and it reached an audience of 12.2 million at radio, which ic actually down considerably from the prior period. All versions of the song are blended into one charting entity, including the original, the version with Stallion as well as several remixes BTS released on their own. While Stallion’s verse absolutely helped reinvigorate the track, her version was not responsible for the majority of consumption in the past week, so she isn’t technically credited on “Butter,” which means she misses out on scoring another No. 1 on the Hot 100. “Butter” debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 back in early June, and the seasonal cut ended up ruling for nine nonconsecutive weeks. The track initially only stepped aside to make for BTS’s even-newer single “Permission to Dance,” which also opened in first place, making the South Korean superstars one of the only groups in charting history to replace themselves atop the list. Recently, “Butter” was forced off the throne by The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s “Stay,” which owned the tally for four frames in a row.  BTS have now hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 with five songs: “Dynamite,” ""Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)"" with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo, “Life Goes On,” “Butter” and “Permission to Dance.” So far, the last two titles have not been connected to a larger project, such as an EP or album, though chances are they likely will be sometime soon.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/07/btss-butter-returns-to-no-1-on-the-hot-100-with-a-little-help-from-megan-thee-stallion/,BTS’s ‘Butter’ Returns To No. 1 On The Hot 100 With A Little Help From Megan Thee Stallion
"Colin Hanks Colin Hanks has gotten into the cannabis space — well, sort of — with a very unique strategy. The actor, producer, director and entrepreneur recently partnered up with multi-state cannabis operator Jushi Holdings to sell his Hanks Kerchiefs-branded products at the company’s Beyond / Hello dispensaries – and online. A portion of all sales will go towards assisting California farmers who have been impacted by wildfires, while helping amplify the message of the not-for-profit organizations that support them.  You don’t need to be a multimillion-dollar business for your company to have a charitable component, Colin declared during an exclusive interview. “Every little bit helps.” Interestingly, and unlike many other celebrities getting into the cannabis game, Colin is not a big stoner. He indulges here and there, socially, but doesn’t make the herb part of his daily routine. This, however, does not mean he carries any prejudice against cannabis. “Like a majority of people my age, I think it was not really a big deal when I was growing up,” Colin explained. “I enjoyed it quite a bit in my younger days and always felt that it was something that was not as big a deal as older generations really seem to make it out to be. And so, ironically, I sort of lost interest in it around the time that it started to become a little bit more acceptable in a mainstream sense.” Still, Colin is happy with this mainstreaming of the plant. In fact, he loves to see “cannabis stores and billboards and things” popping up all over America. “To me it's just such a non-issue. I'm just so glad that we've somehow been able to collectively get over it. And as soon as people that have been in prison for far too long for these things can be let go, we'll be able to move on with the conversation.” As Colin delved deeper into his history with cannabis and his more frequent use during younger years, he remembered the acts of comedian Bill Hicks.  “He's got a lot of really funny material about that kind of thing: ‘Have you ever met an aggressive, violent guy? Are they drunk or are they stoned? Chances are they're drunk. They're not stoned,’” Colin reminisced. “Now, I feel like the way that I have looked at the issue for years has become the conversation now – which I'm grateful for, because then it shows me that I'm not insane, that it wasn't irrational to have that sort of belief.” And he went on: “I don't believe that alcohol should be illegal. And cannabis serves many more positive functions than alcohol does. The uses [of cannabis] that are positive in nature, I think outweigh any of the negative.” Colin Hanks But the actor quickly followed up with a warning: cannabis needs to be respected and consumers need to be mindful of the effects it has and can have. “That comes with being an adult and being able to try and look at things from a certain perspective, if you will. But it’s clear cannabis serves a million better uses than alcohol does, and yet people don't flinch at alcohol being legal. So that's really the way that I look at it.” For Colin, cannabis is like a glass of wine or a cold beer at the end of a long day. “I know a lot of people use it to sleep. I've done that on a few occasions, when needed. There are a bunch of different positive uses for cannabis. So for me, this idea of ‘you can't be some sort of productive member of society because you smoke cannabis,’ that is just simply not true. “Now, I will say affects different people in different ways,” he added. “But it's fascinating to see how cannabis has evolved and how the conversation around it has evolved. And that to me is, ironically, the kind of conversation that I had been wanting to have about that for a long time when I was incredibly passionate about it.” The Birth Of An Odd Pair Andreas “Dre” Neumann Andreas “Dre” Neumann, globally recognized advertising creative director and photographer, is Jushi’s chief creative officer. Dre is also a long-time friend of Colin’s. It was during a friendly meeting that the idea of selling Hanks Kerchiefs handkerchiefs and other products came up, as the duo discussed the cannabis dispensary experience and compared it to the experience one would get when visiting a Tower Records store – the topic of Hanks’ 2015 documentary “All Things Must Pass.” As Dre shared details on how Jushi’s Beyond / Hello dispensaries look and feel like, it became evident to Colin that they would be the perfect place for the brick and mortar debut of his (until now) fully online brand. “We are always looking for ideas to expand on our experiential values in the stores and go beyond just cannabis related products,” said Neumann. “Sometimes in life you have to recognize the thing that's right in front of you is there for a reason and realize the unique synchronicity. The handkerchiefs were the perfect fit for the stores and an amazing kick off for our new experiential strategy.” Jushi's CEO, chairman and founder Jim Cacioppo saw the strategic value of the partnership right away as well. “We immediately came to the conclusion that a collaboration with Colin aligned perfectly with our vision for BEYOND / HELLO's brand journey. In the cannabis industry, we’re on this unique mission to not only normalize the plant, but also to demystify what dispensaries are. “These stores are no longer some backdoor, clinical speakeasy – they have evolved into sophisticated retail experiences that you would expect to see at Fred Segal in Los Angeles, or let’s say, a Starbucks Reserve. They’re places where like-minded people are gathering to chat and discover cool new products, or even music and art. Our partnership with Colin is the next organic step in what we call our ‘experiential expansion’,” he added. Hanks Kerchiefs In Colin’s view too, Jushi’s dispensaries are “much more than just a dispensary: They are really an environment, a place that you can go to where you can go get cannabis, but you can also get all of these other products that are a part of a larger lifestyle. That, to me, was really interesting and really engaging… One of the things that I loved about record stores was that it wasn't really just about the music you were buying. It was also about the environment, about the people, about the experience.” Making “All Things Must Pass” clearly left a mark on Colin. And it also taught him quite a bit about business. This learning led him to starting one of his own: Hanks Kerchiefs.  According to Colin, Russ Solomon, founder of Tower Records, was also extremely curious, and that inspired him. “He didn't need to know about how everything worked; he didn't need to know how everything operated; but he was curious about it. And so he would enlist people that knew what they were doing and that could answer some of those questions and that also had a curiosity about that.” Fortune, fait and history would also play important roles in the creation of Hanks Kerchiefs. “It was a little bit of a right place / right time / right attitude situation. Not too dissimilar from the relationship with Hello / Beyond,” he explained. “I have always had a personal connection to kerchiefs or bandannas. They were always prevalent in my house growing up. At stores or truck stops or whatever, I'd always be looking and grabbing one and adding them to the collection.” And this is true. For decades now, Colin has very often been seen carrying a handkerchief, just like your grandpa used to. Also for years, Colin saw handkerchiefs as utility items, as opposed to fashion accessories. But as he got older, the fashion element came to be more prominent. “While this is a business, it’s also a creative outlet for me,” he voiced. Hanks Kerchiefs Beyond history and creativity, there’s one more element about handkerchiefs that has always fascinated the California native: The fact that they are pretty universal items.  “The more and more I looked into the history of them and the designs of them and the fact that it is an item that is relatively simple to manufacture, the more I loved them,” he said. “Depending on the material and the design, it could be for anyone. It could be a very high-class item with a high markup or something that's a little bit lower for everyone else in between, from models to mechanics. I really liked that concept.” By means of conclusion, Colin looked back at his entrepreneurial journey and reflected. “I think part of it is just a genuine curiosity about things. I think that is truly the first little building block that you need in any sort of endeavor,” he ended.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2021/09/07/colin-hanks-on-cannabis-and-handkerchiefs-appealing-to-everyone-from-models-to-mechanics/,"Colin Hanks On Cannabis And… Handkerchiefs?

"Luke Backhouse As ways of living, working, and spending leisure time continue to change, particularly in a post-COVID world, real estate developers need to rethink the ways they develop property. There are well-known multi-billion dollar companies such as WeWork who have innovated in the space. However, there is also a new wave of young property developers coming through who are thinking of creative ways to innovate in the industry. One of these entrepreneurs who comes from a family with a history in real estate but is innovating for the current environment to take the business to the next level is Luke Backhouse, CEO of Backhouse Group. Early Beginnings  Luke grew up in Liverpool in a relatively large family which had a long heritage in real estate. His grandfather was a well-known real estate developer who built his business up from nothing into one of the largest real estate developers in the U.K. However, whilst life should have been rosy for Luke, tragedy struck as his Dad passed away when he was only four years old and he was then raised by his grandfather. The last boy in his family meant he ended up getting into the family business and he left school at 13 with no GCSEs to take up his apprenticeship. Rather than starting in an office-based role his grandfather wanted him to learn the trade properly so he worked as a laborer learning about the business from the ground up. After working his way up the ranks, in 2016, his grandfather began taking a step back from the business, and still in his mid-20s Luke was catapulted to the forefront of the business where he would start leading on deals.  Leading The Family Business  At the time of Luke assuming more responsibility, the business had already grown into one of the largest commercial landlords in the U.K. However, one change Luke quickly noticed they could make was turning any estate that wasn’t performing well into retail or residential space which further grew the development arm of the business. This arm of the business, today called Backhouse Group, is a full-scale development and construction company based in Liverpool. Their execution capability spans a full 360-degree approach from ground-up construction to property management across commercial, residential, and industrial property, owning over 10m square feet of property today. Additionally, something important to Luke and the group is that whilst commercial success is important each project they have developed is a cornerstone for the communities where they make long-term commitments, and take pride by investing in up-and-coming areas with one example a 700-bed apartment scheme in Widnes.  700-bed apartment scheme in Widnes Omnia Hospitality Group & The Future In addition to the U.K., the expansion of Luke’s business endeavors have expanded internationally. He currently has a partnership with an entertainment executive who he met at an airport lounge in Toronto where they immediately struck up a conversation and realized their passions were similar. They launched Omnia Hospitality Group which has become one of the most talked-about hospitality companies in the U.S. This has meant partnerships with leading venues such as Nobu, SBE, and Hilton as well as brands such as Evian and Beluga. More recently they have begun partnering with celebrities, both musicians such as Grammy award-winning Mike Will and athletes, matching them with brands in spaces with experiences that you would not expect. They have significant development and partnership projects coming up they are negotiating, one of which involves a global social media platform and a fashion brand in the action sports market. They expect many more of these over the coming years as we come out of COVID-19 so which makes this a company worth keeping an eye on.  It would be easy to say that Luke was born with a silver spoon in his mouth however the way he sees it his job is to turn the “silver spoon into gold” he says. This work ethic has been noticed with awards such as British property 30 Under 30 which means he’s certainly on his way to replicating the success his grandfather was able to achieve and continue the family legacy.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommywilliams1/2021/09/07/meet-luke-backhouse-entrepreneur-combining-development-and-entertainment-to-innovate-in-the-real-estate-market/,Meet Luke Backhouse: Entrepreneur Combining Development And Entertainment To Innovate In The Real Estate Market
"Twenty-one states have yet to reach the goal President Biden set for the U.S.having 70% of adults at least partially vaccinated against Covid-19, even though the country surpassed the milestone in August—but an uptick in inoculations is bringing many places closer.

Vaccine hesitancy remains high in many of these states despite experiencing outbreaks this summer that ranked among the worst in the world.  Mississippi, Idaho, Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia are part of a growing list of states where all or nearly all intensive care unit (ICU) beds are filled amid surges in coronavirus-linked hospitalizations.  But an uptick in vaccinations nationwide has also brought a handful of states closer to the target threshold.  Arizona, Iowa, North Carolina, Alaska, Michigan, Oklahoma and Arkansas are all just a few percentage points away with more than 65% of adults partially vaccinated.  After months of steep decline, the number of coronavirus vaccine doses administered each day began to increase steadily in July. It then jumped even further in August, with around 14 million people receiving their first dose of the vaccine, up from 10 million the month prior, according to White House Covid-19 Advisor Jeff Zients. The uptick in inoculations comes as polling suggests Americans are feeling more worried about the coronavirus as the delta variant surges. This more infectious mutation has helped drive hospitalizations to over 100,000 and deaths to nearly 1,400 each day in the U.S..  9. That’s how many states surpassed a 70% partial vaccination rate over the past month. Florida, Utah, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Wisconsin, Nevada, South Dakota and Kentucky were all varying distances from the milestone when the U.S. reached it nationally on August 2.  “​Here Are The States Where Covid-19 Vaccine Refusal Is Still The Highest, Poll Finds—Including Ones Where Cases Have Surged” (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/07/21-states-still-havent-hit-bidens-70-vaccination-goal-but-some-are-getting-closer/,21 States Still Haven’t Hit Biden’s 70% Vaccination Goal—But Some Are Getting Closer
"UNITED KINGDOM - FEBRUARY 01: Photo of AALIYAH (Photo by Sal Idriss/Redferns) It’s been 20 years since Aaliyah tragically passed away in a plane crash, but her popularity hasn’t diminished, and she is still regarded by many to be one of the most successful and most influential R&B musicians of all time. The singer’s catalog is finally being rolled out to streaming services and digital storefronts after an odd and lengthy absence, and fans rushed to support the first reintroduced title, helping the late superstar demonstrate her undeniable power on at least one Billboard chart. This week, Aaliyah doesn’t just reappear on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart, a ranking of the bestselling R&B-only tracks in the U.S., she dominates the list. The Grammy nominee occupies five spots on the tally, which only features 15 spaces. That means that Aaliyah commands one-third of all available real estate this time around. Aaliyah’s single “One In A Million,” the title track from her newly re-released album of the same name, opens at No. 1 on this week’s R&B Digital Song Sales chart. The tune is the powerhouse’s first champion on the list, and it’s one of her four current top 10 smashes.   Not far behind “One In A Million” are four other tracks from One In A Million, with “If Your Girl Only Knew” launching in the runner-up space. Fellow singles from the album “4 Page Letter” and “Hot Like Fire” open at Nos. 5 and 9, respectively. Just outside the top 10 comes “The One I Gave My Heart To,” which enters the tally at No. 11. Aaliyah has now scored five top 10 hits on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart and half a dozen placements in total. Before this week, she once appeared at No. 5 as a featured artist on Chris Brown’s “Don’t Think They Know,” which hit the ranking in 2013. The R&B Digital Song Sales chart didn’t exist when Aaliyah was alive, so it’s understandable that the singer’s total career counts aren't much higher. Her sums will almost surely continue to climb in the coming weeks and months as the other releases in her back catalog that have been missing from online outlets like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon

"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week he doesn’t plan to ask President Joe Biden for his resignation after previously shutting down the idea of impeaching him, casting upcoming elections as the true referendum on the president’s performance. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 04: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attends a press conference ...

The Senators spoke out on the tax proposal saying that it will hurt job growth and the middle class. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Asked during a press conference in Kentucky on Thursday whether there have been talks about asking Biden for his resignation, McConnell replied that Biden is “not going to do that,” noting Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress. McConnell added that “as a practical matter, he’s not going anywhere,” pointing to the 2022 congressional elections as a “report card” for the administration and the 2024 presidential election as the best opportunity to oust Biden. The comment came after McConnell poured cold water on the idea of Congress trying to remove Biden by force, stating at an earlier event in Kentucky “the president’s not going to be removed” and “there isn’t going to be an impeachment.” The remarks by the Senate GOP leader represent a break with dozens of House and Senate Republicans who called for Biden to resign or be removed last week over his handling of the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Those calls, stoked by the deaths of 13 U.S. service members in a suicide bombing in Kabul, have died down some since the U.S. completed its withdrawal last week, though Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, said as recently as Monday Biden is “unfit” for office. Biden took considerable heat from Republicans in Congress as the U.S. scrambled to withdraw Americans and Afghan allies from Afghanistan in the later half of August after the Taliban swiftly captured the capital city of Kabul. In all, the administration said it evacuated more than 120,000 people, including 5,500 Americans, from the country, with around 100 Americans left behind. 4. That’s how many Americans were evacuated from Afghanistan overland on Monday, the State Department said. Rep.

" NIO ES8 electric SUV at NIO's headquarters in Hefei, Anhui Province of China. (Photo by Ruan ... [+] Xuefeng/VCG via Getty Images) Technology powerhouse Intel Corp’s Mobileye subsidiary and German car rental giant Sixt SE will start a driverless ride-hailing “robotaxi” service test in Munich next year and hope to expand it across Germany and eventually Europe later this decade.  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and Sixt announced the plan at the IAA Mobility show in Munich.     The venture will use the NIO ES8 all-electric SUV from China for the venture.  The companies didn’t say how long the testing program might last.  “Additional details about operations will be available next year,” a statement said. “Mobile-powered robotaxis will begin a driverless pilot on Munich streets in 2022 at speeds up to 130km/hour (80 mph), with vehicles expected to begin commercial passenger operations after receiving regulatory approvals. The test fleet will begin with a couple dozen vehicles and grow with the service over time,” according to the statement. The global automotive industry has high hopes for the driverless taxi business, not least because the hugely expensive autonomous car technology it is developing is probably a long way from acceptance in the private market for cars and SUVs. Just this month, Argo AI, the autonomous driving startup backed by Volkswagen and Ford, said it is planning to test electric VW ID.BUZZ robotaxis at a track in Munich with the ambition to start a service within 4 years. Alphabet’s Waymo and GM-backed Cruise are also cranking up self-driving taxi ventures in the U.S.     Speaking at the IAA Mobility show, Intel’s Gelsinger said the project aspires to scale driverless ride-sharing services across Germany and other European countries late this decade.  Why start in Germany? “A recently enacted autonomous vehicle (AV) law permits driverless vehicles on German roads, allowing Mobileye robotaxis to begin early-rider testing on Munich streets in 2022. The fleet will thereafter move from test to commercial operations upon regulatory approval. Germany has shown global leadership toward a future of autonomous mobility by expediting crucial AV legislation,” Gelsinger said.  “Our ability to begin robotaxi operations in Munich next year would not be possible without this new law,” he said. Intel said the deal with SIXT was the first commercial robotaxi service between a tech supplier and a mobility services provider.  “With strong logistics and operational partners like SIXT, Mobileye can bring the promise of full autonomy to life in cities around the world,” said Mobileye CEO Professor Amnon Shashua.

It has about 80% of the global market for advanced driver-assistance vision systems. It is developing its camera-based technology with a system using radar and lidar laser censors which it aims to make, using an Intel chip, Bloomberg said in a profile on Mobileye.    Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.  Also presenting at IAA Mobility was Hyundai with its robotaxi based on the Ioniq 5 electric vehicle and expected to begin transporting passengers next year, according to investment bank UBS, although it didn’t say where. Hyundai has said it will begin public service in 2 years through a partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft

"Americans are no longer confident President Joe Biden has communicated a clear plan to tackle the pandemic, according to a new Gallup poll published Tuesday, in line with the president’s worsening approval ratings as the country battles a delta variant-fueled wave of Covid-19.  More Americans view Biden's communication on the pandemic negatively than positively for the first ... [+] time, according to a new poll.  A Gallup poll, conducted August 16-22 among 3,552 adults, found 42% of Americans do not believe Biden has elucidated a clear plan of action to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, up from 35% in July. The poll marks the harshest review of Biden’s pandemic messaging since October—a time that covers his candidacy, time as president-elect and time as president—according to Gallup’s polls, and for the first time ever fewer Americans, 40%, were positive about his coronavirus communications than negative. Opinions on communications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state governors have followed similarly negative trajectories, the poll found. While opinions on the CDC fluctuate, they now skew decidedly negative, Gallup found, with 41% saying they do not believe the agency has communicated a clear pandemic plan. That level of negativity has only been recorded twice before—once in September amid heightened concerns over the rapidity of vaccine approval (41%) and again in January amid skyrocketing cases (40%)—though the number of people expressing a positive attitude towards the CDC’s pandemic communications (32%) remains above nadirs from those two times (25%). Opinions on communications from state governors, which have consistently been more positive than negative since Gallup began polling the topic in June 2020, are souring, with 35% of Americans believing there is no clear communication on pandemic response from governors, up from previous polling, although 41% still believe governors are communicating clearly on the crisis. Increasing negativity towards officials and organizations managing the pandemic comes amid a persistent wave of coronavirus and a new barrage of restrictions attempting to manage it. Many of these new policies—like the reintroduction of masks and social distancing recommendations—had been phased out in every state bar Hawaii and were reimposed on vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. This was a marked shift in approach from organizations like the CDC, prompted by the highly infectious nature of the delta variant, following many months of officials holding up vaccines as an end to restrictions and lockdowns. The president’s approval ratings in particular have been sliding as the country manages another wave of the pandemic and troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan.  Unlike Biden, opinions on pandemic communications from former-president Donald Trump consistently polled as more negative than positive, according to Gallup.  Americans' Ratings of CDC Communication Turn Negative (Gallup) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/09/07/fewer-americans-than-ever-think-biden-has-a-clear-plan-to-fight-covid-poll-finds/,"Fewer Americans Than Ever Think Biden Has A Clear Plan To Fight Covid, Poll Finds"
"Two 2021 graphic novels, Red Lines by Cherian George and Sonny Liew (MIT Press) and Orwell by Pierre ... [+] Christin and Sebastien Verdier (Self Made Hero) both address issues of censorship and free speech. Fake news, gag rules, NDAs. cancel culture, government crackdowns, algorithmic deceptions: It’s as though we live in a world that took George Orwell’s 1948 classic 1984 as an instruction manual for controlling thought and expression. But because people on all sides feel that they, and only they, are the victims of this chill, it’s difficult to find a contemporary analysis of censorship and free speech that does not resort to partisanship and finger-pointing. Now two works of graphic nonfiction released in the last month take on this challenge from two different directions, each with great success. Red Lines: Political Cartoons and the Struggle against Censorship by Cherian George and Sonny Liew, ... [+] published August, 2021 by MIT Press. Red Lines: Political Cartoons and the Struggle Against Censorship by two Singaporeans, Cherian George and Sonny Liew (MIT Press, August, 2021), takes the direct approach. This is a scholarly and systematic look at efforts to suppress political speech in the form of cartoons, drawings and comic strips historically and globally.  As the book lays out in great detail, cartoons have a unique power to get under the skins of authorities, hypocrites and stuffed shirts in all times and all cultures. Because cartoons are so informal and approachable, efforts to censor them appear especially humorless and heavy-handed, which can redound to the benefit of satirists and provoke a public outcry against the oppressors.  Consequently, the efforts to stifle this kind of speech have grown both sophisticated (through invisible means of influence applied to publishers, distributors and consumers of the content) and coarse (violence, repression, and mass murder in the case of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo). Red Lines offers vivid examples from around the world indicating the many ways governments, religious authorities, economic interests and others conspire to stifle dissent and silence cartoonists. The authors, accustomed to the chilly attitude of their home country of Singapore toward speech that violates the “consensus” promulgated by the government, view censorship as anything that impedes the free expression of the artist’s ideas, not just official action. They present examples of subtle intimidation by authorities, commercial censorship (cartoons whisked out of sight by media companies), censorship by technology (either through bloodless algorithms or opaque and unappealable platform policies), the well-meaning censorship of online mobs out to suppress “problematic” expression, and outright violence and intimidation, among others. Red Lines s not exactly a graphic novel, although there are sections that are done in comics style. It is more of an extensively illustrated textbook, full of word balloons and narrative blocks, charts, clip art, Fumetti-style photo-collages and other graphic elements along with sequential art. Both authors seem comfortable working in this visual format; the two previously collaborated on the award-winning, best selling graphic novel The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye and Liew has worked at the highest levels of the American comics business. All of visual design helps, at least partially, to decompress what is a very dense and academic work (it clocks in at 448 pages). It also carries the point across in ways that plain text could not. Red Lines might not be beach reading, but it surely belongs on the syllabus of any media studies class as it sets the standard for discussion of this topic. Orwell, a graphic novel biography of the famed novelist, by Chrstin and Verdier, published by Self ... [+] Made Hero, July 2021 Orwell, a graphic biography of the famed British author by writer Pierre Christin and artist Sébastian Verdier (English edition from Self Made Hero, July, 2021, following a 2019 French release from Dargaud) arrives at largely the same place but takes a completely different path. Orwell famously predicted a world where censorship was so ingrained in the fabric of government and society that any form of critical thinking was viewed as a crime by the totalitarian regime. It is thanks to him that we have the colorful vocabulary for describing modern censorship and the manipulation of perception: Big Brother, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, Room 101, two-minutes hate, and many others. If history has flattened Orwell into this collection of his “greatest hits,” Orwell seeks to reclaim the legacy of the man through a gripping narrative of his life story. Christin and Verdier explore how Orwell, born Eric Blair, synthesized a range of influences and experiences from his upbringing in the twilight years of the British empire, into the clear-eyed perspective on the dangers of totalitarianism that he exhibited in his masterworks Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell’s unusual variety of life experiences, from being the “clever poor boy” in his elite British prep school to a low-level colonial authority in Burma to a destitute vagabond throughout the 20s, helped shape a worldview that was able to step outside the frames of class and ideology typical of the era. The final step in his education was his traumatic tenure as a foreign fighter in the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, where he took up arms to defend the left wing Spanish state from a fascist rebellion led by Francisco Franco. Orwell himself survived the experience but his idealism perished on the battlefield; from then on, he recognized that ideologies that elevated abstract theory over ordinary human experience could only lead to oppression, no matter how lofty their stated goals. For someone as disdainful of comics as Orwell apparently was (he wrote critically about Superman and the superhero genre in the 1930s), he is extremely well-served by the medium in this book. Verdier’s black and white artwork is gorgeously detailed where it needs to be, while telling the story without much fuss and frill. It is especially good at evoking the atmosphere of pre-war Britain and the various physical environments. Orwell avoids emphasizing its subject’s most famous work; 1984 literally does not appear until the next-to-last page, with an extended quote to give the flavor of the book. However the final section, After Orwell, provides broader context and some incidental overlap with Red Lines in its description of how factions have appropriated some of his passion and critique in service of illiberal agendas stemming from various points on the political compass. For Orwell, dystopia was a world in which words and meaning have parted company, whether through the explicit work of censors or through the insidious processes of self-censorship, euphemism and intimidation. As Orwell and Red Lines make clear, the courage to stand up to those forces is as necessary today as it was in 1948.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2021/09/07/two-new-works-tackle-censorship-and-the-power-of-speech/,Two New Works Tackle Censorship And The Power Of Speech
"Saks Fifth Avenue is giving eight rising brands the VIP treatment. Saks Fifth Avenue is invested in new talent. With the Delta variant rearing its head, the upscale retailer is throwing its weight behind a spate of up-and-coming designer labels that will differentiate its offering at a time when consumers need a little extra incentive to visit stores.  The New Wave, a roster that includes Ashya, BruceGlen, Busayo, Kimberly Goldson, LaQuan Smith, Reese Cooper, A.W.A.K.E. MODE and Alejandra Alonso Rojas has launched at the upscale retailer as part of an accelerator program aimed at supporting and developing high-potential independent brands and speeding their growth at Saks, and ultimately, the greater fashion landscape. “Through this program, Saks has been working closely with the brands on all different facets of their business,” said Anna Irving, senior vice president and general merchandise manager of women’s designer ready-to-wear at Saks Fifth Avenue. Saks is projecting an 80% percent increase in volume of the eight labels in 2022, and expects the brands to collectively drive a roughly seven-figure business. Saks started by developing a list of exciting emerging brands, which were then vetted by the retailer’s executive team, Irving said, adding, “We then identified the brands that had significant growth potential, but needed more support to scale. While some of these brands had been in business for quite some time. It was clear they could benefit from sharing our knowledge, resources, and network, whether in design, merchandising, marketing, or business development.” Saks wasn’t necessarily looking to fill white spaces in its assortment, Irving told me, but rather, wanted to highlight labels by Black, Indigenous and People of Color, emphasizing independent talent as well as BIPOC companies.  Saks Fifth Avenue has launched an accelerator program to nurture and grow up-and-coming designers. “We ensured that half of the brands are BIPOC-owned, furthering Saks’ commitment to increasing representation in its assortment,” Irving said. “All of the brands chosen are ones that we felt offered a totally new fashion perspective to the customer and had great potential to scale.” The year-long accelerator program offers an onboarding bootcamp, mentorship, and entrepreneurial workshops to help brands gain the skills and insights needed to grow their businesses at Saks and beyond.  Each brand will be eligible to receive a $10,000 end-of-program grant to support their business operations and growth, as well as dedicated marketing support from Saks. And as the presenting sponsor of the program, Mastercard 
  
  MA 
  will offer participating brands access to its Digital Doors program which helps small businesses further grow and digitally enhance their online presence. Saks mentorship opportunities will be offered to each designer, with functional expertise to support each brand’s specific needs and gaps in their businesses. Accelerator designers will have Q&A sessions with established talents including Thom Browne, Jonathan Simkhai, Jason Wu and Loeffler Randall’s Jessie Randall, among others.  The program offers 360-degree immersion on topics such as financial strategy, and supply chain and product development and production. There will be a sales strategy roundtable, featuring Brand Assembly, showroom 10eleven and wholesale e-commerce platform NuORDER, as well as legal and HR discussions.  Laquan Smith is one of eight designer promising brands to be showcased by Saks Fifth Avenue. Participants will be taught how to execute and measure their marketing strategies, and receive coaching in leadership. They’ll also have cross-functional internal advisory sessions to develop action plans and plot next steps. Saks is treating the new brands like part of the family with marketing opportunities that include added exposure on Saks.com and digital communications, multi-vendor New York flagship window and visual moments, and dedicated clienteling and training, including product knowledge and training for style advisors, who can confidently recommend the labels.  Asked whether customers in some of Saks’ smaller markets will appreciate the accelerator brands, Irving said, “Customers in all of our markets are very interested in new fashion, especially brands that offer a fresh point-of-view. What’s unique about our accelerator program is that we’re not only sharing resources to help these businesses scale, but we are also giving them the opportunity to grow through our investment in purchases. The designers are all available on saks.com, as well as a few select stores for now. “We definitely selected the brands with the Saks customer in mind,” Irving added. “These brands offer just what our customers are looking for, luxury designer fashion that’s unique and inspiring, but at the same time relatable and approachable.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/09/07/saks-fifth-avenue-catches-a-wave-of-talent-with-new-accelerator--program/,Saks Fifth Avenue Catches A Wave Of Talent With New Accelerator  Program
"As school mask mandates remain a major source of contention, a new Axios/Momentive poll finds that while 59% of parents support school mask mandates overall, some groups are far more likely to be opposed than others based on demographics like income level, race and their partisan affiliation. Students wearing face masks arrive with their parents on the first day of classes at Baldwin Park ... [+] Elementary School in Orlando, Florida, on August 10.  The poll, conducted August 16-25 among 10,168 parents, found the biggest predictor of school mask mandate opposition was a parent’s political party, with 56% of Republican parents opposed to school mask mandates versus 24% of Independents and 4% of Democrats. White parents are also far more likely to oppose school mask mandates, with 42% opposed versus 6% of Black parents, 15% of Hispanics and 25% of those of other races. Parents’ opposition to mask mandates increases as their income goes up: only 19% of parents earning less than $50,000 per year oppose the mask requirements, versus 36% of those earning between $50,000 and $99,999 and 40% of those making more than $100,000 annually. Men are more opposed to school mask mandates than women, with 36% of fathers against them versus 24% of mothers. Older parents are least likely to oppose the mandates, with only 21% of parents ages 65 and up against the mask requirements versus 28% of those ages 18-34 and 31% of those ages 35-64. The smallest difference between demographic groups is in parents’ education level, as 29% of parents that only have a high school education or some college opposed the mandates versus 31% of those with a college or graduate degree. The poll also provided breakdowns among parents in 12 states, which found the states with the highest level of opposition to school mask mandates are Iowa (44%), Ohio (43%), Minnesota (38%) and Colorado (37%). With the exception of Iowa, which bans school mask mandates, states that have provoked the biggest mask controversies because of state-level policies banning school mask mandates actually largely saw lower levels of opposition. Only 25% of parents in Florida, 26% in Texas, 27% in Arkansas and 32% parents in Tennessee opposed school mask mandate bans, and Axios notes Republican parents in Texas and Florida were less likely to oppose mandates than Republicans in other states where the mandates aren’t banned. The polling was based on small sample sizes of only a few hundred parents per state, however, and not all states were polled, so those findings may potentially be skewed. 61%. That’s the percentage of parents that said school districts in their area are requiring students to wear masks. The states with the highest share of respondents in areas with mask mandates are Illinois (73% requiring masks) and North Carolina (63%), and the lowest are Iowa (10%) and Tennessee (35%). The Axios poll is in line with other recent polling showing a majority back school mask mandates, though parents have shown lower levels of support than adults overall. School mask mandates have been a particular source of controversy as the new school year has started amid the delta variant surge, leaving children ineligible for vaccination particularly vulnerable. Mask mandates have led to numerous clashes and even threats of violence at school board meetings, and 10 states have enacted policies that prohibit school districts from imposing mask mandates, though not all are presently in effect. Those state policies have drawn particular controversy, with numerous lawsuits—some of which have been successful—and school districts requiring masks in violation of the state measures. Some school districts in Illinois, which mandates masks in schools, have also taken the opposite tack and declared masks optional despite the state-level mandate.

The title, named after his late mother Donda West, opens at No. 1 with more than 300,000 equivalent units, scoring one of the largest opening frames of 2021. With one more Billboard 200 champion to his credit, West advances yet again on the all-time ranking of the musicians who have hit No. 1 on the albums chart the most often, and he joins a very exclusive club now that he’s accrued another ruler. Donda is West’s tenth No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, and he is now just the seventh musical act to chart double-digit chart-toppers. With 10 leaders on the all-genre ranking, the “Gold Digger” hitmaker is now tied with both Eminem and Elvis Presley for the fifth-most No. 1s on the tally. Presley isn’t likely to reach the top spot again, though both Eminem and West continue to add to their totals whenever they have new music to share, so both rappers could easily progress again in the coming years. The Beatles continue to lead the charge among all artists when looking at who has the most No. 1 albums, and they still have a pretty safe lead over all other acts. The Fab Four managed 19 No. 1 releases throughout their time together and even afterward. Behind the pioneering rock band comes Jay-Z, who has thus far reached the peak with 14 collections. Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand are tied as the musicians with the third-most winners, with 11 apiece. West has thus far reached the top spot on the Billboard 200 with nine solo albums—Late Registration, Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Yeezus, The Life of Pablo, Ye and Jesus Is King—as well as Watch The Throne, a collection released alongside Jay-Z as the super duo The Throne.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/07/kanye-west-ties-elvis-presley-and-eminem-for-the-fifth-most-no-1-albums-of-all-time/,Kanye West Ties Elvis Presley And Eminem For The Fifth-Most No. 1 Albums Of All Time

[+] Higashioka #66 of the New York Yankees at first during the second inning at Progressive Field on April 24, 2021 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) This will be a crucial offseason for what will be Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Guardians. A massive face-lift of the 40-man roster may accompany the team as they they shed their Indians nickname and become the Guardians at the end of this season. Reeling from a season that saw them lose their best three starting pitchers for weeks, the team has tried to stay competitive despite having to rush pitchers to the big leagues before their player development was complete. The team’s offense continued to sputter, showing instability in the outfield and an inability to consistently score runs. Prior to the Indians losing their quality starters, the team was competitive. After those injuries, the rotation was in stress, bringing even more pressure to a mediocre offense. The fact that they managed to cobble together 68 victories so far this season is admirable. The Indians front office has long been recognized as among the best in the game. Indians President of Baseball Operations Chris Antonetti and General Manager Mike Chernoff have offered steady, highly capable stewardship of baseball decisions while saddled with reduced player payrolls for several years. Complicating the challenges, the soon-to-be Guardians brass will have to determine which players in their organization must be protected with a promotion to the 40-man roster. fangraphs.com lists the Indians estimated 2021 payroll to be $51M, among the lowest in the game. That is a reduction from the estimated $99M payroll of 2020. Reports have indicated the team will increase payroll in 2022. However, details of the amount of increase have not been released. The status of the MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement, currently being negotiated, will likely help dictate the shape of the payroll. To this writer, Cleveland’s organizational middle-infield depth is among the best in baseball. Several prospects at various stages of their player development have major league upside. Many of those players have the skills to eventually help the big league club on the 26-man roster, or be used to fetch players that can help improve the major league club. To this scout, a trade that includes any of the following middle-infielders could help bring much needed outfield depth for the big league Guardians roster: Andres Gimenez-Age 22 Among the most advanced of the middle-infield prospects, Gimenez came to Cleveland from the New York Mets in the trade for Francisco Lindor. After a brief trial with the parent club, Gimenez spent most of the season sharpening his game on both sides of the ball. He’s a solid defensive player with a hopeful, yet unrealized hit tool. Playing now for the parent club, Gimenez has work to do to improve his hitting. Gabriel Arias-Age 21 Obtained in a trade from San Diego, Arias is an outstanding right-handed hitter with developing power, an ability to hit for average, and an outstanding defensive profile. He would fit well at shortstop due to excellent range, soft hands and excellent arm strength.  Tyler Freeman-Age 22 Currently sidelined after shoulder surgery, Freeman is an excellent hitter for batting average. He doesn’t have much power, but his pitch recognition, bat to ball skills, patience, and plate discipline are solid. He’s a top prospect infielder. Brayan Rocchio-Age 20 The switch-hitting Rocchio has the type of baseball acumen that could be very valuable as he climbs the ladder to the big leagues. He has more power than Freeman and more speed than Arias. He should be able to hit for average, making good contact while driving the ball. Aaron Bracho-Age 20 Like Rocchio, Bracho came to Cleveland in a very good group of 2017 international free agent signings. A switch-hitter, he profiles as a utility infielder capable of playing several positions with enough offense to be credible. Jose Tena-Age 20 One of the younger prospects, Tena is opening eyes with very solid overall play. He has a sweet left-handed swing that just needs repetition and refinement. So far, he has shown scouts a good hit tool and speed enough to cause damage on the bases. He’s an advanced hitter, good defender, and could continue to elevate his game. Richard Palacios-Age 24 A 3rd round 2018 Indians draft choice, Palacios has made it all the way to Triple-A, where he is hitting very well. He has speed, an ability to hit the gaps, and can hit for a very good batting average. The left-handed hitter makes good contact, and could be a true sleeper. Carson Tucker-Age 19 Tucker was a 2020 1st round draft pick out of high school in Phoenix. Tucker is a solid athlete, and could make a switch to the outfield at some point in his career. He has a good feel for the barrel of the bat with a measured swing that generates contact. He is a raw, unproven prospect. However, the Indians paid a reported $2M to sign him, and he’ll get his chance to showcase his talents. Gabriel Rodriguez-Age 19 Rodriguez is seen as a very balanced, multiple-tooled infielder. He could develop power, but for now, he is showing an ability to drive the ball to all fields. Big and strong, he could outgrow a middle-infield role and move to either corner. He has a bright future as a hitter. CLEVELAND, OH - JUNE 17: Yu Chang #2 of the Cleveland Indians rounds the bases after hitting a two ...

Owen Miller-Age 24 Ernie Clement-Age 25 Marcos Gonzalez-Age 21 Raynel Delgado-Age 21 Angel Martinez-Age 19 The future Cleveland Guardians are loaded with potential big league middle-infielders that can be used by the parent club or as trade chips to bolster their organizational depth. During the offseason, the front office will have to decide the upside of each candidate and determine their best course of action for each player.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/2021/09/07/quality-middle-infield-prospects-could-provide-a-boost-for-cleveland-indiansguardians/,Quality Middle-Infield Prospects Could Provide A Boost For Cleveland Indians/Guardians
"(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Who invests a database worth of intelligence into the price of a chocolate bar? Turns out, it could be more than half of all retailers.  In 2020, 58% of top retailers said they planned to implement some form of AI pricing technology by the end of 2021, according to research conducted for Revionics, a pricing technology company. That compares with 34% in 2020.  It’s likely they are implementing the technology as pandemic-related inventory delays cause customer-infuriating price hikes: 90% of shoppers said in a recent survey that they plan to switch brands, seek lower prices or cut back on discretionary spending because of higher prices. More than half are already doing so. The extent to which artificial intelligence can place retailers ahead of these shifts hinges largely on its ability to optimize price at the individual level – not simply to inform prices on circulars. So far, the results indicate it can.  In fact, AI has the potential to cure the “COVID-effect” of pricing, empowering retailers to meet new expectations of loyalty and personalization while seeding a dramatic change in which consumers, retailers and product makers all benefit.  This is why: AI uses machine learning to create algorithms that automatically detect patterns in consumer behavior. The software factors external information into those patterns, like market fluctuations, and can predict optimum prices to meet sales and volume goals.  So far, its use is proving effective in five areas.     Yes, pricing for the consumer at the personal level is complex, but retail is already heading there – and has been – thanks to opted-in member data gathered through loyalty programs. AI is the next logical step: It accelerates the ability to adjust prices based on a retailer’s promotional activities, price histories, product mix and other data. Not just by chain, geography and store, but by individual.  Intelligent pricing should make all parties smarter. Because when retailers, manufacturers and shoppers are reading from the same page, they can work more closely, share with greater confidence and all reap the rewards.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpearson/2021/09/07/personalizing-price-with-ai-how-walmart-kroger-do-it/,"Personalizing Price With AI: How Walmart, Kroger Do It"
"CHARLESTON, WV - MAY 08: U.S. Senate Republican primary candidate Don Blankenship addresses ... [+] supporters following a poor showing in the polls May 8, 2018 in Charleston, West Virginia. President Donald Trump weighed in on the Republican primary yesterday in a tweet, urging West Virginia to vote for Blankenship's opponents, declaring the former coal executive ""can't win the General Election . . . "" (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) Don Blankenship is pugnacious. He has battled federal prosecutors. And he just delivered a staggering blow to Donald Trump, Jr., who tried to upend the former coal baron’s 2018 bid for a U.S. Senate seat — a plan that went offtrack when Junior falsely tweeted that Blankenship was a “felon.” Blankenship sued for defamation and a U.S. federal judge just decided that the case can go forward.  Blankenship was convicted of a single misdemeanor for violating federal mine safety laws. He was found not guilty on two felony counts of securities fraud and of making false statements. Any search of the internet would reveal this. And thus the judge said that the public could infer that Junior knowingly sought to destroy Blankenship’s reputation. Junior, who argued it was a mistake, left up the incriminating tweets long after they were originally posted.  This is a huge win for Blankenship, reached just before the Labor Day weekend. This dispute won’t settle. The former coal baron had been accused by federal prosecutors of crimes that could have landed him in prison for 30-plus years. But prosecutors told this writer that he never wanted to negotiate. In the end, he was convicted of the one misdemeanor that got him a year in prison. During that time, he authored a booklet called An American Political Prisoner.  Blankenship’s “allegations are sufficient at this stage to create a ‘plausible inference’ that Trump, Jr. published his tweet with knowledge of its falsity,” writes Judge John Copenhaver, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. “Trump, Jr.’s remaining arguments fail because labeling (Blankenship) a felon can constitute a provably false assertion of fact.” Legally, defamation is to knowingly make a false statement that can damage someone’s reputation. And if it is in written form, it is called “libel.” To prove defamation, plaintiffs who are public officials — Blankenship was a candidate for the U.S. Senate — must have “clear and convincing evidence.” And they must show that the statements were made with “actual malice.” That is the standard set by New York Times v. Sullivan, which is a tough hurdle. In West Virginia, “actual malice” can be proven by circumstantial evidence.  Some background: Blankenship’s trial ended in December 2015 and he was sentenced in April 2016. He served his time. In January 2018, he announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate from the state of West Virginia. In the run-up to the election, the coal exec had been gathering steam and some speculated that Blankenship could win the Republican nomination.  Enter Trump, Jr., a ne'er do well who insinuated that Blankenship was a “felon” — words for which he never corrected or apologized: Blankenship says that this act caused him “enormous damages” that also led to his defeat. A statement is considered “defamatory” if it harms someone’s reputation — meaning it lowers their value in the eyes of a community or it prevents professional associations.  “Regardless of whatever reputation (Blankenship) may have had in West Virginia, the complaint plausibly alleges that Trump, Jr.’s tweets lowered (Blankenship’s) reputation in communities both within the state and outside the state, particularly since the plaintiff was in a campaign for federal political office,” Judge Copenhaver writes in his order.  No Settlement  File- In this file April 10, 2010 file photo, people from the coal mining towns along the Coal River ... [+] participate in a memorial vigil in Naoma, W.Va., for 29 miners who died in the explosion at Massey Energy Co.'s Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W.Va. A year since the disaster, Massey Energy company and their CEO Don Blankenship, "" King of Coal"" , are no longer around.(AP Photo/Amy Sancetta, File) The criminal case against Blankenship was multifaceted. But the gist of it had been whether the former coal baron skimped on safety measures in favor of increasing productivity and profits. Blankenship remains convinced of his innocence: hiring more miners to avert “non-willful” mine safety violations would not have prevented the deaths of 29 miners, he wrote in his booklet.  He had pointed to a different coal mine, which he said most resembles that of the ill-fated Upper Big Branch facility. The “Harris Mine,” he noted, had 35 more miners but received 250 more violations than did Upper Big Branch. The prosecution says that it just followed the facts and that accountability had been paramount: between January 2008 and April 2010, the coal mine in question had received 835 citations for such infractions as poor ventilation and excessive coal dust. At the time of the accident in April 2010, Blankenship’s company had been assessed penalties of nearly $900,000 but it had only paid about $168,000 of that. Then the unthinkable happened: 29 miners were engulfed in an underground explosion. Blankenship was accused of violating mine safety laws.  Blankenship had been one of three major Republican candidates vying for the seat held by Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat. Ultimately, WV Attorney General Patrick Morrissey had been declared the Republican winner, who Manchin defeated. Blankenship refused to support Morrissey, calling him complicit in the state’s opioid crisis — one that is still devastating southern West Virginia. His son-in-law told this reporter that Morrissey’s involvement was “disqualifying.” It’s an interesting position given that Manchin had earlier said that the coal exec had “blood on his hands.”  “Under the conspiracy charge, the jury was also asked to decide whether there was an intent to defraud the United States,” Blankenship wrote in his book. “If the jury believed there was such an intent, it would be a felony conviction and subject to five years in prison.”  Judge Copenhaver rightly notes that anyone with the ability to type keywords into a search engine could have discovered that Blankenship was found guilty of a misdemeanor. If Junior had “mistakenly” thought it to be a felony, he could have immediately corrected himself — something he failed to do. Moreover, in the specific tweet to which Junior implies that Blankenship is a felon, he references a CNN story that clearly says that the verdict resulted in one misdemeanor.   Where does this leave Trump, Jr.? Unfortunately for him, Blankenship is an unrelenting hard-ass who wants to get his pound of flesh. He won’t settle it. He wants justice, not money. A jury will ultimately hear the evidence. The facts favor Blankenship. But the fog from the Upper Big Branch mine explosion has never lifted and the memories of 29 men who perished that day are still fresh.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2021/09/07/former-coal-baron-blankenships-defamation-suit-aims-to-knock-out-trump-jr/,"Former Coal Baron Blankenship’s Defamation Suit Aims To Knock Out Trump, Jr."
"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is completing its review of Lockheed Martin’s 
  
  LMT 
  proposal to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne 
  
  AJRD 
  in a $4.4 billion transaction. Aerojet is the nation’s last independent producer of liquid and solid-fuel rocket motors, with annual sales of about $2 billion. Lockheed is the company’s biggest customer, generating 33% of Aerojet sales pre-pandemic and an additional 10% through a joint venture with Boeing 
  
  BA 
  called United Launch Alliance. The proposed merger thus is an example of vertical integration, in which a company seeks to acquire portions of its supply chain necessary to the manufacture of finished products. As a result of sector consolidation, Aerojet's main rival produces rocket motors for all three ... [+] stages on the Navy's Trident II nuclear missile.  For instance, Lockheed uses Aerojet solid-fuel rocket motors on several of its missiles. Other companies in the same line of work, notably Raytheon, have argued that the proposed transaction would give Lockheed Martin an incentive to discriminate on pricing in order to gain a competitive advantage in the missile business. Raytheon accounted for 17% of Aerojet sales, pre-pandemic. There seems to be concern in defense circles that FTC Chairman Lina Khan will apply novel antitrust reasoning to the merger, with far-reaching implications for future rationalization of the sector. This concern is probably misplaced: Khan’s innovations in antitrust theory result from her analysis of companies like Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
  and Google 
  
  GOOG 
 , enterprises for which there are few obvious precedents in U.S. economic history. The Lockheed-Aerojet combination would be a more traditional tie-up of two industrial entities, for which existing case law is more than adequate to reach an appropriate conclusion. Having worked for many years with all of the parties involved, including Raytheon, I see five factors as being determinative in how the Federal Trade Commission will likely rule. Defense is not a typical market. There is only one military customer that matters, the government, and thus the defense market has the characteristics of a monopsony. The same is true of the nation’s civil space program: NASA drives demand, and in fact provided 21% of Aerojet sales pre-pandemic. Because government entities largely determine the character and scale of demand for Aerojet products, the views of the relevant agencies will likely bulk large in the FTC’s assessment of the proposed merger. The FTC’s Khan will meet with her Pentagon counterpart this week to discuss the merger. If the defense department is strongly opposed to the merger, then it probably won’t happen. If it is not opposed, then the merger will probably proceed. The most likely outcome is that the merger goes forward, but with conditions aimed at preventing any loss of competition in the rocket-motor business. Integration is the rule rather than the exception. In the years since the Cold War ended, the domestic rocket-motor industry has undergone a drastic transformation. Previously independent suppliers merged to create more survivable combinations in the face of declining demand. Meanwhile, a new community of non-traditional launch providers emerged, exemplified by SpaceX. The non-traditional companies tend to build their rocket motors internally; SpaceX’s business strategy from the beginning stressed vertical integration. The traditional rocket-motor companies have been submerged in more broadly integrated enterprises. For instance, Alliant Techsystems, manufacturer of the third stage on the Navy’s Trident nuclear missile, in 1995 merged with Hercules Aerospace, builder of the second stage. The resulting combination then acquired Thiokol, builder of the first stage, in 2001. The company subsequently merged in 2014 with Orbital Sciences, which in turn was acquired by missile producer Northrop 
  
  NOC 
  Grumman in 2018. This steady integration of the sector, both horizontally and vertically, was driven mainly by demand trends. Aerojet Rocketdyne is the product of a 2013 merger of two previously separate companies that reflects the chronic distress in the sector. Rocketdyne was previously owned by Rockwell, then Boeing, then United Technologies 
  
  UTX 
 —all of which elected to sell it. The proposed merger could strengthen competition. Even in combination with Rocketdyne, Aerojet only generates about $2 billion in sales annually. This inevitably raises questions about its resilience, given the volatility of both the products it makes and the customers it serves. One big setback, such as a program cancellation, could doom key product lines. Over the last several years, Aerojet has gradually lost market share in large solid rocket motors. Today, the viability of that product line depends on the willingness of prime contractor Northrop Grumman to continue providing Aerojet with a role on the nation’s next-generation ICBM. Other opportunities beckon, but they all involve government programs that may not come to fruition. Competing for such opportunities is expensive. A merger with Lockheed Martin would provide access to financial resources that otherwise could only be obtained at significant cost from capital markets. One reason that investors have long expected Aerojet to merge with a larger entity is that it will need such resources to remain competitive. The competitive landscape is not level. The 2018 merger of Northrop Grumman with Orbital Sciences created a disequilibrium in the solid rocket motor sector. Aerojet Rocketdyne, a company with only $2 billion in sales and narrowly-defined competencies, now faces a competitor with $36 billion in sales and far broader market presence. Even in areas where Aerojet has world-class expertise, the combined Orbital-Northrop enterprise has gradually squeezed Aerojet out of the market. If Northrop had excluded Aerojet from the future ICBM, its role in supplying large solid rocket motors would be in jeopardy. There is no obvious way to level the competitive landscape other than to permit the assimilation of Aerojet into a larger enterprise. But that entity needs to be committed to Aerojet’s core markets, otherwise the rocket-motor industry would continue its inexorable march to monopoly. A sale to private equity investors, for instance, would probably lead to less investment in new products. A Lockheed-Aerojet merger with conditions may be the best available option. It tells you a lot about the rocket-motor market that none of Rocketdyne’s previous three owners wanted to hold onto the business. It is not a sector where vast riches await the right entrepreneur. Lockheed Martin’s proposed merger may be the best option for maintaining competition in key product categories. Lockheed Martin has pledged to avoid discriminatory pricing or the inappropriate sharing of competition-sensitive information. Obviously, the FTC can’t simply accept such a commitment at face value. It needs to fashion the same sort of consent decree imposed on Northrop Grumman in 2018 as a condition for approving the merger with Orbital. Some observers contend that arrangement failed to prevent anti-competitive behavior on Northrop’s part. However, having witnessed the agonizing decision that competitor Boeing made to pull out of the ICBM competition, handing it to Northrop, I know what the real problem was: FTC didn’t enforce the restrictions it had imposed. With a rigorous enforcement mechanism that maintains Aerojet Rocketdyne as a merchant supplier to all customers, there is no reason why such behavioral remedies cannot be made to work. If that solution is not embraced, then Aerojet’s long-term role in the rocket-motor business does not look promising.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/09/07/five-factors-that-should-drive-the-ftcs-assessment-of-a-lockheed-aerojet-merger/,Five Factors That Should Drive The FTC’s Assessment Of A Lockheed-Aerojet Merger

(Photo by Danilo Di Giovanni/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Italy’s Serie B side Ascoli Calcio has added its name to the list of Italian clubs with North American ownership, as New York-based family office holding company North Sixth Group, LLC acquired a 31% stake in the club last week. North Sixth Group chairman Matt Rizzetta has revealed some of the details of the new partnership with Massimo Pulcinelli, Ascoli Calcio’s majority shareholder since 2018 through his holding company Ferinvest Italia S.R.L. and CEO of Bricofer Group S.p.A., one of Italy’s largest retail chains for do-it-yourself and home goods.  The deal between North Sixth Group and Ascoli Calcio is a confirmation of the American investors’ growing interest in the Italian soccer market that has been observed over recent years. From left to right: Roberta Pulcinelli, member of Ascoli Calcio's board of directors; Daniela ... [+] Mancinelli, CEO of North Sixth Group's communications agency N6A and member of the board of directors; and Massimo Pulcinelli, owner of Ascoli Calcio and CEO of Bricofer S.p.A. “The purchase values Ascoli at approximately €20 million ($23.7 million), with additional premium payments in the event that the club gets promoted to Serie A,” Rizzetta told me.  The transaction assigns North Sixth Group a 31% minority stake in Ascoli Calcio and entitles it to two seats on the club’s board of directors. The percentage of shares, however, might increase significantly by the end of the 2021-22 Serie B season. “We purchased an initial 31% interest with options to 51% which we can elect by the end of the season,” continues Rizzetta. Regardless of the amount of shares, Rizzetta explains that his priority is to always work hand in hand with the Pulcinelli family, for whom he expressed great admiration in the way they have been handling business both at the club and at Bricofer. “I have immense respect for Massimo [Pulcinelli] and his family, who built a €500 million empire in the retail sector from nothing,” says Rizzetta. “The most important thing is that we have a partnership and a co-ownership structure alongside the Pulcinelli family, and this will not change regardless of who holds the most shares in the club.” Rizzetta added that a few other American investors have joined North Sixth Group in supporting the Ascoli Calcio project. He mentioned NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end and Super Bowl LV winner Ndamukong Suh, former Univision Communications CEO Vince Sadusky, venture capital firm Wavemaker Partners and Los Angeles-based investment company KM Sports Ventures.

For North Sixth Group, Ascoli’s tradition and glorious past represents a unique story that needs to be told to the many sports fans around the world.  “We want to preserve the tradition of Ascoli and introduce fans in the international market who might not be as familiar with the club to the beauty, tradition and heritage of Ascoli,” says Rizzetta.  His desire to reach the global soccer audience is visible in the substantial investment plan that North Sixth Group has laid out to grow the Ascoli Calcio brand in the U.S. “We are investing considerable dollars in the North American market, well over $3 million between resources from our NSG family of companies and key growth initiatives such as content, marketing and the opening of Ascoli Club NYC and a youth academy in the future.” ASCOLI PICENO, ITALY - JULY 13: Massimo Pulcinelli Patron of Ascoli Calcio looks on during the ...

Rizzetta admits that he had been looking to join forces with someone that would share a similar vision of globalizing the soccer club by developing an international strategy that could open new revenue streams outside of Italy.  In this sense, Rizzetta is grateful to the Pulcinelli family for having built a solid financial foundation at Ascoli Calcio, because it allows North Sixth Group and the other American investors to channel their energy toward gradually growing the club rather than having to lay the groundwork. “This was very unique and appealing to us, as it enables us to bring in new skills, new networks and open up new markets without having to recreate the infrastructure,” Rizzetta explains. At a time when U.S. investment is looking increasingly more at the Italian soccer landscape, Rizzetta believes that Ascoli Calcio has in its management the right blend of skill sets to be successful on the pitch while operating in an innovative way in the international market. At the heart of the partnership between North Sixth Group and the Pulcinelli family, Rizzetta continues, is a shared passion and vision for the future of Ascoli Calcio, which together they hope to bring back to its glorious Serie A days.

Obviously, it is always essential to bring home the result!” According to a recent report by Gazzetta dello Sport, Genoa’s president Enrico Preziosi is about to sell the Grifone to Miami-based private investment firm 777 Partners.

"Shang-Chi Shang-Chi is busy destroying box office records and racking up sky-high critical and audience scores, but many viewers will walk away from the film with the same question. “What’s the deal with those rings?” The Ten Rings are central to the story, the vessel for The Mandarin to exercise dominance over the world, but even if they are eventually transferred to Shang-Chi, their origin is never explained, and the film ends with the idea that this is going to be an important mystery for the MCU to solve. Spoilers follow. On film, the Ten Rings are unlike really anything we’ve seen since maybe Yondu’s whistle arrow, and here, they’re a blend of tech and mysticism with a purposefully murky origin. The after-credits scene of Shang-Chi, the first one, has Wong, a mystical expert, consulting Bruce Banner, a scientific expert, and Captain Marvel, an alien expert, about their origin. In short, no one has any clue where these rings are from and what they actually are. But it’s discovered that they are broadcasting some sort of beacon to…somewhere.  So, what are the Ten Rings? While the comics does have an answer, I’m not so sure we can trust it to be a roadmap for what Marvel has planned going forward here. After all, Shang-Chi did not rely on a specific storyline for the plot of the film, as though it used elements of the character and its comic history, this was an original tale. Shang-Chi Even the rings themselves changed. The Ten Rings were not armbands, but ten finger-rings of power, each with their own unique abilities. That was totally changed for the film (and no doubt made all those fight scenes much, much better). If you look at the comic origin for the Ten Rings, things get a bit…weird.  The Ten Rings are actually power sources for an alien spaceship created by the Makluans, a race of space dragons. The Mandarin originally got his hands on them by finding a crashed Makluan ship and killing Axonn-Karr, who warned him against taking the Rings.  If we were following the comics, presumably, the idea might be that the Ten Rings are calling out as a beacon to the Makluans, a race which includes the likes of famed comic dragon Fin Fang Foom, which many thought may show up in Shang-Chi.  But this is where things get confusing. The Makluans and Fin Fang Foom are not in Shang-Chi, even though we are intimately dealing with giant magic dragons. The “Great Protector” does not appear to be a Makluan alien, but rather a mystical being in the Ta Lo dimension, and what seems like it’s being indicated to me is an idea that perhaps, we’re not teasing a race of space dragons as an invading force in the future of the MCU, which would seem a bit odd after dealing with different giant dragons in Shang-Chi’s premiere. Shang-Chi In short, I don’t think we can know what Marvel has planned for the Ten Rings, but I would not be surprised to see them rewriting their origin story to better suit their purposes. In truth, we don’t actually know for sure what Marvel’s big bad threat is supposed to be for this coming phase, similar to how we eventually got to Thanos. There seems to be a team of anti-Avengers being assembled (Yelena Belova, US Agent) but on the cosmic level, Eternals is teasing the arrival of Eson the Searcher, a Celestial, that some have gotten confused with Galactus. And yet many think it’s Galactus himself who will eventually be the next main threat of the MCU, given that we’re getting a Fantastic Four movie down the road here. The other option is Kang the Conqueror, after the multiverse-based events of Loki.  I just don’t really see the Makluans fitting into all this, or them being the answer to the Ten Rings tech or the “beacon” question in Shang-Chi. I may be wrong and this is definitely supposed to be some sort of Fin Fang Foom teaser for a sequel, but I think something else is at work here.

"Bakery workers in Richmond, Virginia on the picket line. Since August 10, unionized bakery plant workers in five states who make Oreos, Ritz and Chips Ahoy, have been on strike. Here is what two striking bakery workers have to say. Carl Miller has worked for Nabisco for 34 years and is a member of BCTGM (Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco, Grain Millers) Local 358 in Richmond, Virginia. Mike Burlingham has worked for Nabisco for 14 years and is BCTGM Local 364 Vice President in Portland, Oregon Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Errol Schweizer: Tell us a bit about your job. Mike Burlingham: I have been a worker at the Portland biscuit factory for 14 years now. And I've done a variety of roles. I think when people hear the word baker, you're picturing the white coats and the tall hat, and they're rolling out dough. And for a lot of the smaller bakeries, that's exactly what it is. But we do things on a very large scale. It is a large bakery that takes up several city blocks. The process starts with giant silos, filled with our raw ingredients and tanks with oil, and goes through the process with automation. So we have our mixing department, which trickles down into a big shop where things go through very large ovens on a very large conveyor, which then heads down into our packing department where everything is mostly done by machines operated by us. And then it's sent out to our warehousing and distribution centers. BCGTM Local 364 Vice President Mike Burlingham with co-workers in Portlan, Oregon on the picket ... [+] line. Errol: What has it been like during Covid-19? Carl Miller: When we were first mandated to be open for production, we weren't sure of COVID. We didn't know where it came from. We didn't know how it was transmitted. But then as time progressed, a few individuals in the bakery had tested positive. Now, we wouldn't get this information until one or two days later, and then find out where this particular individual actually worked. You begin to backtrack in your mind as to where was that? What was I doing? And have I been around them, they've been around me? As far as working in a bakery, it is very unrealistic to work in a six foot separate capacity, a lot of jobs are overlapping, you have to give directions, you have to talk, you have to share, you have to assist. It left stress levels to be rather high. And volume was just incredible. Because we make all the products that people eat for comfort, you know, everybody was sitting on their couches during the pandemic eating Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, you know? And the expectation was to be here. My wife herself contracted COVID-19. And that, for me was very stressful, very scary. And to still have the pressure to come to work. Carl Miller of BCTGM Local 358, has worked at Nabisco for 34 years. Errol: What inspired the strike? Carl: The backstory is that Mondelez acquired us in a split with Kraft Foods 
  
  KHC 
  back in 2012. So earlier in 2012, we had just re-negotiated a new contract with Kraft Foods at that time. When Mondelez acquired us in 2012 we could almost feel the atmosphere change right away, you could tell that the this was a whole different animal that we were going to be working with. Mondelez is a global company. So, we're no longer competing with markets in North America, we're now competing against Europe and China. And so when it came time for renegotiation in 2016, they put out a letter to us, and that basically summarized that was it going to be our way or the highway, these are the concessions we want you to take. And it was written in a way as if they were trying to tell us that us making less money and paying more out of pocket for our benefits is good for us. Basically, what that means is, you can either take these, or we can take our business elsewhere. They have two very large factories down in Mexico. And 2016 was also the same year that they told Chicago to accept concessions. And Chicago didn't agree to their terms. And so true to their word, Mondelez closed half of Chicago. So the 1200 person workforce went down to 600, just like that. And they invested that down in Mexico, which we have to believe was their intent all along. Just in those last seven years, we've seen over 2000 people now out of work, because they have shut the bakeries down. Mike: So in 2016 was our first time meeting at the table with Mondelez. And it was very clear they had certain things in mind, and they were unwilling to budge from those. One of those things at the time was to back out of our pension plan. That's a big reason why people have come to work at these Nabisco bakeries, is that we had a pension plan and between the money you can make with the benefits along with the pension, it's a good job. It was a place that you can plan to work for a long time. And retire from. And that's exactly what people do. There's folks who put my 14 years to shame, they've been there for 40-50 years. So it's incredible. It is. It really is. We have one lady in our bakery here, she's been there for 55 years. And she's still going. Bakery plant workers with Local 364 in Portland, Oregon on the picket line. Errol: What is at stake ?  Mike: We're not coming into these negotiations with a bunch of wants. We're coming in saying, we've already fought for what we have today. We've already given up things in the past. We are asking to maintain those benefits and Mondelez, their stance on it is, “Well, we weren't there for that, we know nothing about it, this is what we want.” So things went stagnant. In spring 2018, without negotiation, the company sent out a statement that they were withdrawing from our pension.  We've paid for those long before my time there, the people before me, who fought to have that benefit. They already gave things up. And you know, it's unfortunate to see something like that happen, especially because this is manufacturing. And as automated as some things are, it's still a labor intensive job, you are putting in a lot of hours, you have mental and physical fatigue, and you put your body at risk. And I can speak personally, that I've been injured on the job. So, that’s the trade off, you're putting your body at risk when you go there. And, you know, the payoff is at the end, do you have something that you can retire with? And now that's gone? That's horrible. Mondelez in particular, had a very profitable year. In 2020, Mondelez, netted $26 billion in revenue. Their net income for the quarter ending June 30 of this year was $1.08 billion. That's a 98% increase, or double the second quarter earnings from 2020. Mondelez net income for the 12 months ending June 30, was $4.3 billion. And that's a mere 24% increase. So they're doing very well this year, going into these negotiations. This isn't a company that's hurting. We're not coming into these negotiations with a bunch of wants, just keep what we have.  BCGTM Local 364 and supporters in Portland, Oregon. Errol: How can the public support your efforts? Mike: This is a nationwide strike with Nabisco. If you're near any one of the locations, showing up and getting the word out. If you're nowhere near these areas, while we're out on strike, avoid buying Nabisco products.   I just read a quote from the striking coal miners in Alabama, that this this isn't just about us, that this is a fight for America's working class. So keep yourself educated and fight for what you know your worth. Carl: It's just my opinion that the unions across the country, I think we're all inspired by each other right now. Because everybody's having the same experience. We all worked harder than we ever did during the pandemic. We were exposed. We were put in harm's way. And we worked. We showed up. We made them all that money. And then they come to the table and they ask for everything.  This is our line in the sand. We're standing up for ourselves finally. Everybody stand up together standing with their humanity. We are united. Everyone should really pay attention to what this means, it's the middle class fighting to stay alive. And we're all banded together right now. The union movement is strong. If you're not union, you should join one.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/errolschweizer/2021/09/07/why-are-bakery-workers-who-make-oreos-ritz-and-chips-ahoy-on-strike/,"Why Are Bakery Workers Who Make Oreos, Ritz And Chips Ahoy On Strike?"

"Tacko Fall, then with the Boston Celtics takes a shot between Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Thon Maker. ... [+] (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) Tacko Tuesdays are officially over in Boston. It was pretty much assumed that Tacko Fall, the tallest player in the NBA, would not be back with the Boston Celtics after the team declined to re-sign him earlier in the offseason. Last week, the Cleveland Cavaliers made the ending official when they signed Fall to a one-year deal. The Celtics signed Tacko Fall to an Exhibit 10 Contract in 2019 after the 7-foot-5 center gained nationwide attention during his four-year stint with UCF. The Celtics signed Fall, who grew up in Senegal and came to the sport as relative newcomer, after he fell out of the NBA draft. They did this realizing he was going to be something of a project, so the team signed him as a two-way player who would split time between the NBA club and the G League Maine Red Claws (who are now rebranding as the Maine Celtics). In his rookie season, Fall became a cult sensation. Crowds would go so far as to start chanting his name during games that had essentially been decided, something which became so common that it even sometimes happened in the opposing team’s stadium. A second year as one of Boston’s two two-way players was supposed to give him enough professional experience for the team to figure out if he had a future with the team or not. Unfortunately, Fall just ended up being a victim of timing: the Red Claws shut down for the entire season thanks to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This meant that Fall was only getting reps with the main club in less than ideal situations. Most often, Fall would appear in garbage time or stretches where they were so shorthanded that head coach Brad Stevens penciled Fall just as a change-of-pace big man option. In the end, he appeared in just 26 games with the Celtics, averaging 2.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game while strongly suggesting that his shot-blocking skills have earned him a longer look from a team. Fall deserves a chance to prove that he’s more than a curiosity, but the Cavaliers might not be the ideal landing spot. After all, they just acquired Lauri Markkanen from the Chicago Bulls to go along with a group of big men that still includes Kevin Love, unless he finally does agree to a buyout, alongside Jarrett Allen. On top of that, the team just used the third overall pick to land Evan Mobley. Even though it may seem like Tacko Fall has just made the league—his career is only two seasons old—but there may be more pressure on him than you would think. Life on the margins of the NBA can be brief: there are only so many roster spots and the competition only becomes younger the longer a player lasts.  At merely 25, the clock might already be ticking for Tall even though he literally towers over the rest of the league. Let’s hope he makes it, the league is more fun for his presence.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2021/09/07/in-the-end-tacko-never-had-enough-time-with-the-boston-celtics/,"In The End, Tacko Fall Never Had Enough Time With The Boston Celtics"
"Icelandic strongman Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson is one of the cofounders of the latest skyr brand in the ... [+] U.S. market. U.S. consumers’ climbing interest in skyr, an Icelandic yogurt that delivers more protein using four times the amount of dairy than traditional yogurt, bodes well for Thor’s Skyr, the latest brand cofounded by Icelandic strongman Hafþór Björnsson, actor Dylan Sprouse, and restaurant industry veteran Unnar Danielsson. Yogurt sales in the U.S. have been relatively flat over the past decade, the latest Statista data showed, expected to increase slightly to $7.24 billion. But skyr has carved out a sweet spot in the increasingly competitive market, outgrowing several subcategories such as Greek yogurt, according to Nielsen. While previous skyr brands, including Siggi’s and Icelandic Provisions, are already on fast growth trajectory with the former acquired by the world’s largest dairy company Lactalis in 2018 after reportedly reaching $200 million in sales, Thor’s Skyr promises higher protein, less added sugar, and low lactose. American tourists’ frequent request for the traditional Icelandic dairy delight at Danielsson’ previous restaurant in Reykjavik, which was forced to shut permanently during COVID, makes launching Thor’s Skyr in the U.S. a no-brainer. The product currently comes in original, vanilla, blueberry, and strawberry flavors. Hafþór Björnsson (left), Unnar Danielsson (middle), and Dylan Sprouse (right) want to make skyr a ... [+] mainstream U.S. treat. Danielsson initially partnered with Sprouse, who he recalled so obsessed with Icelandic culture that even attempted to make skyr in his own kitchen, before onboarding long-term friend Björnsson as their third cofounder — the company shares are equally divided among the trio. “Dylan is a little ‘Iceland crazy,’ and he’s probably the only Disney star who actively follows Ásatrú, the traditional Nordic religion of Thor, Odin, and the other Nordic gods,” Danielsson jokingly said. “Hafþór and I used to work together in the nightlife industry many years ago. It's weird that we have all these world-class strongmen in Iceland eating loads of skyr every day to bulk up, but none of them represent a skyr brand.” For Björnsson himself, being a brand ambassador for Thor’s Skyr is personal, and he plans to leverage his enormous fan base to launch the product on a social platform called Thor’s Academy. Björnsson said: “I represent the real results of skyr. Thor’s Skyr from the beginning was about bringing more than a tasty treat; it’s about a lifestyle of health and fitness.” To create the nutrient-dense product that contains 17 grams of protein and one gram of added sugar per cup, the team signed up with Reykjavik Creamery, a dairy co-manufacturer in Pennsylvania operated by a fellow Icelandic Gunnar Birgisson, whose family traces their connection to skyr back to 1647.  The 13,000-square-foot gluten-free plant, equipped with additional storage and shipping capabilities, currently runs in two shifts, processing around 100,000 gallons of milk per week all sourced from local dairy farms within the state, according to Danielsson. Its Tetra Pak ultrafiltration system developed in Iceland also helps reduce lactose content by half. Thor's Skyr plans to enter 10,000 U.S. retailers by 2022.  The size of the facility is expected to more than double by 2022 to support Thor’s Skyr’s rapid expansion as it’s already available at 500 different regional retailers that cover the majority of the U.S., including Giant and Earth Fare, with pending partnerships with several national retail chains. “Our goal is to be in 10,000 stores next year, and we believe our brand can help grow skyr's share among the overall yogurt market significantly,” Danielsson said, noting how Thor’s Skyr also has the potential to enter adjacent snacking categories such as nutritional bars — a model that has proven successful for many skyr businesses in Iceland. The growing presence of skyr is also a good sign for many U.S. dairy farmers who feel increasingly threatened by the plant-based movement and rising operation costs, Danielsson believes, coupled with the recent milk price rebound. The average of inflation adjusted milk prices have increased to $3.32 per gallon in 2020 after dropping below $3 for the first time in 2018 since 2004, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Skyr is more than a breakfast food or something for a packed lunch,” said Danielsson. “We’re hoping to maneuver into the snacks market to create something people can easily grab and feel good about.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2021/09/07/viking-invasion-icelandic-strongman-hafr-bjrnsson-and-dylan-sprouse-backed-thors-skyr-promises-more-protein-and-less-sugar/,Viking Invasion: Icelandic Strongman Hafþór Björnsson And Dylan Sprouse Backed Thor’s Skyr Promises More Protein And Less Sugar
"A rendering of Don Purcell with the art of Ashley Longshore on the walls. Don Purcell is the latest alumnus of The Jeffrey Kalinsky School of Retail who is opening or in the process of opening a specialty store. It’s a testament to the training and contacts the founder of Jeffrey New York bestowed upon employees at the Manhattan, Atlanta and Palo Alto, Calif. locations, which were a fertile training ground for retail talent until all three stores were shuttered during the Covid-19 pandemic by owner Nordstrom Inc. Purcell will unveil on September 10 during a soft opening, a 1,200-square-foot flagship in Atlanta, featuring on the walls the work of art world star Ashley Longshore, a New Orleans-based artist, whose bold style is matched only by her extroverted personality. Don Purcell, a distinctive curation of fine jewels, art and gifts combined with a passionate personalized luxury in-store shopping experience, will be located in Buckhead, a high-end residential and shopping district in the northernmost fifth of the city. The jewelry selection will feature collections by Cathy Waterman, Eli Halili, Hoorsenbuhs, Irene Neuwirth, Loree Rodkin, Marie Helene de Taillac, Melissa Kaye, Mio Harutaka, Nina Runsdorf, Renee Lewis, Sanjay Kasliwal, Spinelli Kilcollin, Sylva & Cie and Will Hanigan Pearls. Purcell’s taste runs the gamut, from delicate Eva Fehren diamond rings and bracelets to Monies’ colorful pieces made from natural materials such as wood, amber, amethyst and lapis lazuli. On the more whimsical side, Purcell will feature The Paper-Cut-Project, which makes intricate paper wigs and has partnered with Hermès in the past. Trudon candles and  Horsenbugh is a favorite of fans such as Newbark, Jay Z, and Buscemi. Judith Leiber minaudieres, which are small works of art themselves, will round out the offerings.   Don Purcell will feature Cathy Waterman's necklaces. Purcell, who was the inaugural general manager of Jeffrey New York when the Manhattan flagship opened, said, “I worked at Jeffrey for over 25 years and suddenly I didn’t have a job anymore. I started thinking about what I really wanted to do, and a dream of mine has always been to one day open my own store. “I decided that this was the best time to do it,” Purcell added. “I have relationships with amazing designers and vendors. Jeffrey was a great teacher and a great retailer, and he’s mentored me through this whole process. We talk about a couple of times a week.” Jesse Dong honed his skills and earned his luxury stripes as a buyer at Jeffrey for eight years. In April, he opened Two: Minds, a 3,000-square-foot multi-brand retailer on Gansevoort Street in New York’s Meatpacking District featuring labels such as Givenchy, Stella McCartney, Tom Ford, The Row, Jacquemus and Khaite.  Philip Manghisi will launch Wunderkind on the border of Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, Arizona in December. He said of Kalinsky, “I learned from the best. Jeffrey was so smart and shrewd and good at what he did, watching him think and seeing him run the store was an education.” Wunderkind will feature Balenciaga, Chloe, Stella McCartney, Paco Rabane, Dries Van Noten, and the Elderstatesman, among other ready-to-wear and contemporary labels, along with shoes, fine jewelry, eyewear and home products.  “I’ve been traveling to Scottsdale for years,” Manghisi said. “From the first time I went, I couldn’t understand why there were no specialty stores there. Barneys New York closed in 2016. There’s money there and women are spending on themselves.” A rendering of the exterior of Don Purcell. Don Purcell will get a burst of energy from Longshore’s art, and an array of her products will be for sale, including handbags and clever hostess gifts. “I’m very close with the amazing artist Ashley Longshore,” Purcell said. “She’s kind of like a sister to me in a lot of ways. Her art will be in the store for the first eight months to a year, and after that, she’ll help me curate other artists that we want to support. Ashley is a force to be reckoned with. I admire her talent.”  Purcell decided to open his namesake store in Atlanta, where he lived prior to joining Jeffrey in New York. He returned to Atlanta in 2007 to run the Jeffrey store there. “Jeffrey in Atlanta needed a penicillin shot,” he said. “I’m from a town of 200 people in the mountains of Virginia. I do still love New York, but I was ready to go back home to Atlanta. I have an amazing clientele that I’ve built up over the years. Atlanta just seemed like the right home for me. Nobody is doing what I’m going to do in Atlanta.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/09/07/don-purcell-spreads-luxury-wings-with-namesake-store-in-atlanta/,Don Purcell Spreads Luxury Wings With Namesake Store In Atlanta
"The Asia Vision LNG carrier ship sits docked at the Cheniere Energy Inc. terminal in this aerial ... [+] photograph taken over Sabine Pass, Texas. Photographer: Lindsey Janies/Bloomberg “Think we’ll have a cold winter this year?” That’s been a common question heard in the office hallways and field locations of U.S. producers of natural gas since price deregulation occurred in the late 1980s. A colder-than-normal winter has always meant strong demand for the product, which in turn meant stronger prices at the wellhead, which generated more free cash flow and increased capital for drilling budgets for the following year.  All of those things meant more job creation and enhanced job security for the men and women asking that question in the hallway or out in the field. The answer was important to everyone, and the question typically began to be asked in earnest in early September, as summer came to an end and the weather began to cool. This year is different, though. For the first time in a long time - probably since the price for natural gas came crashing down in 2008 as the massive Marcellus Shale and Haynesville resources began to fully come on line, creating what has been a persistent domestic supply glut - U.S. natural gas producers find themselves in a strong price position heading into the fall and not overly concerned about the direction of the weather to come.  The NYMEX Henry Hub index price, which fell below the $2 per Mmbtu level during the depths of the COVID pandemic for several months last year, has more than doubled since, and stood over $4.60 at Tuesday’s open. Even more encouraging for these producers, they have reason to be optimistic that the price could hold at this level or even move higher regardless of whether or not the U.S. experiences a winter that is colder or warmer than normal. One reason for such optimism lies in the underground storage levels that every gas producer watches closely. This is gas injected into massive underground caverns during low-demand months in the spring and fall and used to fill needs during high demand months in the heat 0f summer and depths of winter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), current volume in working storage is almost 17% below last year’s level and 7.2% under the 5-year running average. Such a tight storage situation places upward pressure on prices. Working Gas in Underground Storage Compared With The 5-Year Maximum And Minimum. Hurricane Ida, which took essentially 100% of oil and natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico offline as producers were forced to shut-in their platforms and facilities, has also put upwards pressure on the price. According to the EIA, the Gulf generates about 15% of the nation’s oil production and 5% of its dry gas volumes, and as of Monday, virtually all of it remained offline, resulting in an even tighter U.S. supply situation. That production will likely return to normal within weeks, but the temporary loss will limit volumes going into storage in the meantime. PORT FOURCHON, LOUISIANA - AUGUST 31: Destruction is left in the wake of Hurricane Ida on August 31, ... [+] 2021 in Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Ida made landfall August 29 as a Category 4 storm southwest of New Orleans, causing widespread power outages, flooding and massive damage. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Then there’s the fact that, over the last half-decade, exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have transformed the U.S. natural gas market from a domestic market into a global powerhouse. The EIA reports that US LNG exports hit record highs in March of this year and have remained at elevated levels since. The EIA projects those export volumes - as well as exports via pipelines into Mexico and Canada - to continue to grow through 2022 and beyond as demand rises and new export facilities and planned pipelines continue to come online. All of these factors and more have created a new paradigm for domestic natural gas producers, who have had to work hard over the last dozen years to create new areas of demand for their overwhelming production. With the Biden/Harris administration working hard to place new restrictions on domestic producers, the prevailing narrative around U.S. natural gas has begun to rapidly shift to growing concerns about whether they will be able to meet the country’s future needs.  Thus, while the question about whether or not we will have a cold winter is probably still being asked in hallways and field locations, the underlying concern behind it has now likely shifted. Rather than being worried about future job security, employees are more likely to be concerned about their companies’ ability to meet all the rising demands on their production.

(Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) YouTube, along with Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of music announced that YouTube Music and Premium has reached a milestone of 50 million subscribers which is up 20 million from last year. The company plans to increase the numbers even more  going forward. In a blog post titled  “50 Million,” the platform stated that “YouTube has surpassed 50 million Music and Premium subscribers, including trailers, and is the fastest growing music subscription service out there.” “It's been almost 6 years since we kicked off our subscription journey at YouTube and today we're excited to share the news that we've crossed 50 million Music and Premium subscribers, including trailers,” the blog post read. “It’s an honor to build a membership that allows people to more deeply immerse themselves in music, learning, fashion, gaming, and more, all the while supporting the creators and artists that make it possible. Music and Premium subscriptions are key pillars of YouTube's monetization, enabling unique content and communities to flourish.” Cohen expressed his excitement about the significant accomplishment and the bright future of YouTube. “We've got killer products in YouTube Music and YouTube Premium that deliver truly unique value to artists and creators and the best experience for music fans and video lovers, “Cohen said. “We’re in our own lane — there's no other place where fans can get uninterrupted access to the largest and most diverse catalogue of music, artists and culture. We’re making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing — whether that’s on YouTube or the YouTube Music app.” Universal Music chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge said, “Our trailblazing agreement over three years ago with YouTube established a foundation for their commitment to subscription that led to the launch of YouTube Music. Today, that approach was more than validated as their service passed the 50 million subscriber milestone.” Warner’s CEO of recorded music, Max Lousada, said, “We live in a highly visual attention economy, and YouTube has led the way in UGC and fan expression. Music has always been a pivotal part of their platform, so it’s great to see them become a dynamic force in subscription streaming too. We look forward to collaborating on many more creative campaigns that amplify our artists and ignite cultural moments all over the world.” Cohen also acknowledged YouTube’s subscription growth internationally.  “The unique offerings of YouTube Music and Premium are resonating in established and emerging music markets alike,” he added.” We’re seeing impressive growth in countries like Korea, India, Japan, Russia and Brazil where music is a top passion. “ YouTube Music Premium costs $9.99 a month and lets users listen to and download ad-free music. YouTube Premium goes for $11.99 a month and gives subscribers access to all of the benefits of YouTube Music, with the ability to also download and watch regular videos ad-free. Premium subscribers can also have “videos play in the background while they’re using another app or their phone is locked. For those who spend a lot of time watching non-music content on the platform, that’s a much better experience for not that much more money.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashadgrove/2021/09/07/youtube-surpasses-50-million-subscribers/,YouTube Surpasses 50 Million Subscribers

Rodrigo is partnering with the White House to promote COVID-19 vaccination outreach to her young fans. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) 14 weeks into its time on the Billboard 200, the chart company and publication’s ranking of the most-consumed albums and EPs in the U.S. every frame, Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour shoots back to the peak position. The teen singer-songwriter's debut collection rockets from No. 3 to the summit thanks to its release on vinyl, which spurred a massive sales gain, one which has helped the young musician make history. After Sour was finally released on vinyl, the title sold 84,000 copies in the past tracking week, with 76,000 of those being LPs. With 76,000 vinyl albums sold in one seven-day period, Sour now holds the record of the second-largest sales week of all time for the format (or at least since Nielsen, now MRC Data, began properly tracking purchases in the ‘90s). Sour comes in behind only Taylor Swift’s Evermore, which reset the all-time record for the largest sales week for vinyl albums earlier this summer. The singer-songwriter’s second surprise full-length sold 102,000 copies on wax in June, becoming the first title to rack up a six-digit sales figure in just seven days. Impressively, the Grammy winner’s set had already been out for half a year, but fans still rushed to pick up another copy nonetheless. Sour benefited from a lengthy preorder period, as the vinyl edition of the album was available to purchase months before it actually shipped. All those preorders were counted at once, which helps explain her enormous sales frame, though it can’t be denied that the title is one of the most successful of the year and that Rodrigo is one of the hottest new musicians in the business. Rodrigo grabs the No. 2 spot on the all-time ranking of the albums that have earned the largest vinyl sales weeks in U.S. history from Billie Eilish’s Happier Than Ever, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 just a month ago. That title, the teen’s second full-length, launched with 73,000 vinyl copies sold, which was the second-largest ever, but only for a short time.

"Buy now pay later Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers like Affirm, AfterPay, and Klarna generated a lot of press over the past year as consumers looked for ways to make it easier to buy what they wanted without incurring more credit card debt. Recent developments include:   The percentage of Gen Zers in the US using BNPL has grown six-fold from 6% in 2019 to 36% in 2021. Millennials’ use of BNPL has more than doubled since 2019 to 41%. Gen Xers’ adoption more than tripled, and even Boomers are getting into the act. Buy now, pay later adoption by generation Overall, consumers will make nearly $100 billion in retail purchases using BNPL programs in 2021—up from $24 billion in 2020, and $20 billion in 2019.  Buy now, pay later retail purchases in the US Observers on social media and blogosphere claim that “BNPL is here to stay.” That’s an odd perspective because BNPL—also known as installment payments and point-of-sale financing (POSF)—has been around longer than some of the observers.  Traditionally, installment payments, POSF, BNPL—whatever you call it—was an option at checkout (i.e, the end of the customer journey). Today, BNPL influences consumers’ choices of products and providers (i.e., earlier in the journey).  Students of marketing learn about the 4 Ps of Marketing: product, place, price, and promotion. According to the 4 Ps creator Northwestern professor Philip Kotler:  “The marketing mix is the set of controllable variables that the firm can use to influence the buyer’s response. The four variables help a company develop a unique selling point as well as a brand image.” Payments have become an important element of the selling proposition and should be considered the 5th P of marketing. or example, by varying payment terms—for example, spreading payments for a purchase over a period of time—marketers can influence consumers’ likelihood to buy. As merchants experiment with surcharges on card-related payments, do they run the risk of decreasing sales or average transaction sizes? Do they risk losing sales to merchants who don’t surcharge on card transactions? If the answer to these questions is yes (and BNPL providers claim it is), then BNPL (and payments overall) are an element of the marketing mix for marketers to leverage. To succeed and differentiate, BNPL providers will:   Why does Square need Afterpay’s app to enable merchants to advertise when it has broader reach than Afterpay does? Answer: It doesn’t. Expect Afterpay’s app to be embedded into and absorbed by the Square app after the acquisition is complete.  As Afterpay gets absorbed into Square, its payments will increasingly come from within the Square network, not the traditional payment rails. Other BNPL providers will have to find similar paths in order to keep up with the margin improvements Afterpay will realize.  Same with Amazon and Affirm. The giant retailer is partnering with Affirm—instead of acquiring the company—in order to test the impact that BNPL can have on sales. If it’s positive, they’ll acquire Affirm or build their own BNPL capability.  This is not to say that with their lofty valuations, some BNPL providers—Klarna is a good example—won’t be acquirers themselves. Why? Because a BNPL offering—by itself—is only part of the value chain (or customer journey).  To maximize the value of buy now, pay later, it must be integrated with the other elements of the marketing mix—that is, become the 5th P of marketing. BNPL has its detractors, however. Consumer advocates criticize BNPL programs for encouraging consumers to take on debt they might not be able to afford: “There is a risk that BNPL schemes may attract people who are already in financial difficulties and may be struggling to make their existing bills and payments.” There is evidence of that. Among BNPL users, 31% consider their financial health to be “dire” or “struggling” (versus “managing” and “thriving”). In contrast, of consumers who don’t use BNPL services, just 20% rate their financial health as dire or struggling.  Other warning signs support the critics’ claims:   Detractors’ warnings won’t slow the growth of BNPL any more than their warnings against the dangers of using credit cards have had on the growth of that product.  For now, the majority of BNPL purchases are paid with either a debit or credit card. So, if banks don’t get their money upfront (i.e., at the time of transaction), they get their interchange fee when the BNPL players get paid.  That won’t last.  Merchants have two things in common: 1) They’ll do anything to make a sale, and 2) They hate (with a passion) interchange. If merchants can reduce interchange fees by driving purchases from debit and credit cards to other forms of payments, they’ll do what they can to make that happen.  The long-term impact on banks: Less interchange revenue and customer engagement.  The clue to what banks can do to fight back comes from the number of BNPL users who were late on a payment because they lost track of when the bill was due. Banks can fight back by helping consumers better manage their money. That will be a tough challenge for banks that see themselves as product (e.g., checking account, savings account, loan) providers and not service (i.e., advice, guidance, monitoring) providers.  My bet: Banks will fight back from a regulatory perspective focusing on the alleged downsides of BNPL and the “risks” it presents to consumers. I don’t think they’ll win that battle.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/09/07/buy-now-pay-later-the-new-payments-trend-generating-100-billion-in-sales/,"Buy Now, Pay Later: The “New” Payments Trend Generating $100 Billion In Sales"
"""Rain in the plane"" is a side effect of condensation in the ""dome"" space between the top of the ... [+] fuselage and the ceiling of the cabin in an airliner. Your flight is finally on approach to your destination. As you look out the window, twisting in your Economy class seat, you suddenly feel a cold spot on your cheek. You glance up and see water droplets coming from the overhead. It’s called “rain in the plane” and it can affect everything from aircraft fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to your health.  Sweden’s CTT Systems was founded in 1991 solely to solve the rain in the plane problem. Over the years it has grown into a public company listed on the Stockholm Exchange. Before the pandemic, its annual revenue peaked at $39 million. Its predictable drop in revenue in 2020 has impelled CTT to do something it has done periodically in its history - reminding the industry and the public of the problems it solves.  Airliners have a space between the cabin ceiling and the top or crown of the fuselage sometimes called the “dome.” Warm air from the cabin and outside atmosphere rises into the dome while the aircraft sits on tarmac, particularly in humid climates. As an airliner departs and climbs to cruising altitude, the fuselage skin cools to the outside ambient temperature, around -54°C (-65°F) at 35,000 feet.  You can see the ""dome"" space between the top of the fuselage and the cabin ceiling in this ... [+] cross-section cutaway of an Airbus A300 which typifies modern designs.  The warm, humid air in the dome forms frost which then melts as the airplane again descends into warmer air on approach to its destination. The condensing water droplets then fall into insulation panels or blankets which line the cabin to keep passengers, electrical power supplies and electronics warm. Some aircraft have passages for water to drain from the dome out through fuselage sides to pressure wells in the belly but water still gets into the insulation blankets.  As it does, the water soaks into the insulation material and eventually saturates it. This often allows water to seep between cabin panels in the overhead or around the windows, forming the droplets that land on your face or obscure your view outside. This rain in the plane isn’t just a minor annoyance. Moisture in the insulation blankets can can corrode and disrupt electrical systems, result in mold/fungus, and add weight to the aircraft.  In fact, cabin insulation blankets can hold five to six times their own weight in water, according to Peter Landquist, CTT Systems’ vice president. “Over time, an aircraft like an A320 or 737 can accumulate up to 350 kilos (772 pounds) of water, trapped in its insulation blankets.” The increased seat density of modern narrow-body airliners exacerbate the problem. The average passenger exhales around 100 grams of water per hour. Fuller cabins with more frequent ascents/descents give rise to more moisture wafting up into the dome area. While condensation in the cabin is an obvious clue to saturation in the dome, the insulation blankets can still hold considerable moisture that doesn’t seep into view.  “If you don’t have rain in the plane, the airlines are not aware of it,” Landquist says, explaining that there are no automated monitoring systems and that potential visual inspections are limited and costly. “Maybe [airlines] don’t see it as a problem,” he adds. “They start to act when there is cost-related pressure.” Rising fuel prices create pressure as do downturns in travel. Since it began selling its product in 1996 (to Dutch carrier, Martinair), CTT has seen more interest in its offerings when one or more such factors affect the market.  The company’s solution is a fully automatic anti-condensation system that weighs approximately 64 pounds (29 Kg). Essentially, it’s a dehumidifier based on technology developed by Swedish firm Munters for the industrial/commercial building markets. CTT’s flight-certified version is much smaller with much lower power consumption than an industrial system. According to Landquist it can produce dry air in conditions down to -25C (-13F). It then blows that air into the dome area.  “We create a dry air barrier that prevents moist air from reaching the cabin. If there is water in the insulation blankets, the dry air absorbs the moisture. As it is constantly blown into the [dome] space, it creates a positive flow that goes back into the cabin through [vents] in the ceiling. Then it follows the normal air stream out of the aircraft.”  All illustration of the core dehumidifier/circulation portion of CTT Systems' anti-condensation ... [+] system.  A side effect of the process is an increase in humidity in the normally dry cabin as the system removes moisture from the insulation blankets. CTT claims that its anti-condensation system can increase cabin humidity by up to 25% (it also makes humidifiers for the purpose).  In dry airliner cabins moisture droplets expelled by passengers rapidly evaporate. Smaller droplets remain airborne for longer, increasing the overall time they can float around. The droplet's water loss also changes its structure to a crystallized solid state. Viruses and bacteria get preserved in a floating capsule, where they remain infectious and have a greater potential to infect other people.  In the era of Covid-19, the benefit is obvious as are the reduction in fatigue and increase in immune system strength fostered by more humid cabins. CTT’s system runs continuously as long as the aircraft has internal or external power. The company recommends it running for 150% of every flight cycle due to the importance of keeping the dome area dry during between-flights turnaround operations on the ground. Its operation is invisible to the flight crew though it can alert maintenance crews if a failure is detected.  In an 18-month trial CTT conducted with partner, easyJet, three Airbus A320s were weighed before their anti-condensation systems were activated. After three months, the aircraft recorded an average weight decrease of more than 450 pounds the company says.  For an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737, the weight reduction translates into fuel savings of 6,600-10,039 gallons (US) per year, or a 0.4-0.6% reduction in fuel consumption CTT estimates. It also reduces CO₂ emissions by more than 65 tons, an increasingly attractive quality for carriers facing the regulatory burden or reducing their CO2 impact.  Despite the demonstrable benefits and the industry mantra that “every Kilo counts”, Landquist says that CTT often runs into resistance from potential customers who want exact fuel/emissions savings projections to make the sales case. Generating them entails the costly, time consuming process of weighing each specific aircraft.  “That has always been our problem,” Landquist acknowledges. “Is there 200, 300 kilos of [condensed] water in this aircraft? The airlines know that if they’re operating in specific conditions, with a large number of passengers, they’re carrying extra weight.” Still, CTT’s anti-condensation systems are flown by more than 30 carriers with 3,100 units in service. Most are installed as aftermarket equipment on narrow-body airliners and the 787. The systems are Buyer Furnished Equipment on the Boeing 737-700/800 and as Supplier Furnished Equipment on the Airbus A350 XWB.  CTT recently finalized development of its anti-condensation for Bombardier's Global 7500 executive ... [+] jet.  The company has also diversified into the ultra-large business jet aircraft market with systems available for the 737-based Boeing Business Jet (BBJ), 747-800, Airbus’ ACJ 320neo and ACJ TwoTwenty. CTT is also successfully down-sizing its system for more mainstream bizjets including Bombardier’s Global 7500 and Gulfstream’s G700.  Given that a relatively humid cabin is a luxury, it’s surprising that executive jet OEMs haven’t clamored for appropriately-sized anti-condensation systems sooner. Marketing more comfortable, humid cabins is something airlines are beginning to catch on to with Aeroflot and China Southern now calling attention to the CTT systems in their first and business-class cabins. “The airlines see a benefit in passenger comfort and well-being,” Landquist says.  Even where its systems don’t directly funnel humid air to the main passenger cabin, they still raise the overall humidity level for travelers CTT asserts. They likely increase passenger confidence at the same time by getting rid of that pesky rain in the plane.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2021/09/07/this-swedish-firm-helps-airlines-with-rain-in-the-plane/,This Swedish Firm Helps Airlines With ‘Rain In The Plane’
"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 15: Alize Johnson #24 of the Brooklyn Nets reacts during the second half ... [+] against the Chicago Bulls at Barclays Center on May 15, 2021 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) The Chicago Bulls missed out on veterans Paul Millsap and LaMarcus Aldridge as they tried to round out their roster, but they have already moved on by adding two other players to help with frontcourt depth. Shams Charania of The Athletic first reported Monday the signing of former lottery pick Stanley Johnson, and then ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported the signing of Alize Johnson to a two-year, $3.6 million deal.  The details of Stanley Johnson’s deal haven’t emerged, but K.C. Johnson of NBC Sports Chicago seems to suggest he’s indeed getting one of the final guaranteed contracts to fill out the 15-man roster. Assuming this is truly the case, these two signings put the Bulls at 15 guaranteed contracts plus Devon Dotson’s two-way deal. Chicago also added sharpshooter Matt Thomas, according to Keith Smith of Spotrac, but the current assumption is this is a non-guaranteed training camp deal. With another two-way spot open, Thomas could also get a two-way contract. Stanley Johnson has been a disappointment in his career after going eighth overall to the Detroit Pistons in 2015. Chicago will already be his fourth team, and his offensive game simply hasn’t developed since he entered the league. He holds career averages of 6.2 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists while shooting 37.5% from the field and 29.8% from 3-point range in 371 games.  Last season with the Toronto Raptors, Johnson averaged 4.4 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 16.5 minutes per game. The 25-year-old shot 38.2% overall and 32.8% from 3-land in 61 games, though he did actually torch the Bulls to the tune of a career-high 35 points late in the campaign.  While Johnson offers little offensively, the 6-foot-6, 242-pound forward is another athletic body who can guard multiple positions. After starting his career playing more 2 and 3, Johnson has transitioned to playing much more small-ball 4. He spent over half of his minutes at the 4 for Toronto last season, per Basketball Reference, and he even played some center. Even as a disappointment in the NBA, having Johnson on a cheap deal as an end-of-bench option isn’t a bad gamble.  Alize Johnson is a 6-foot-7, 212-pound forward who primarily played the 3 and 4 with the Brooklyn Nets last season. The athletic 25-year-old could also play some small-ball 5 in a pinch and is known for his rebounding. He grabbed 5.0 rebounds in just 10.5 minutes per game in his 18 outings for Brooklyn in 2020-21.  Before playing for the Nets, Johnson saw limited minutes for the Indiana Pacers after getting drafted in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft. With Johnson and Johnson on board, it solidifies the fact that the Bulls don’t have much shooting on the back half of their roster. Once you get past Alex Caruso and Coby White, Chicago doesn’t have another plus NBA shooter. Instead, the front office prioritized defensive versatility and athleticism for the bench with players like the Johnson duo, Derrick Jones Jr., Troy Brown Jr., Javonte Green and Tony Bradley. Rookie Ayo Dosunmu was an offensive star at Illinois, but he’ll likely earn NBA minutes at first with his defense. Rookie Marko Simonovic has potential as a stretch big, but his outside shot looked like a real work in progress at Summer League. This lack of shooting on the back end of the roster might not be a problem, though. The Bulls have plenty of shooting among their main rotation players, so focusing on defense for the rest of the roster could wind up being the right call. And while it would be ideal to have a bit more size, Chicago has a roster that can play plenty of small ball and play it well. Don’t forget that DeMar DeRozan played primarily as a small-ball 4 for the San Antonio Spurs last season. After these moves, the Bulls will look to add more players for training camp and figure out that second two-way spot. It seems as if the final 15-man roster is essentially set for the start of the regular season, though there could still be some tinkering depending on what happens in camp and in the preseason. Chicago also has a $5 million trade exception from the Daniel Theis trade in its back pocket.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpatt/2021/09/07/chicago-bulls-round-out-roster-with-frontcourt-depth/,Chicago Bulls Round Out Roster With Frontcourt Depth
"Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Lance Lynn throws against the Chicago Cubs during the first ... [+] inning of a baseball game in Chicago, Saturday, Aug. 28, 2021. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) Nothing has come easily for starting pitchers in this, the second consecutive season under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. While it has affected everyone, starters have been uniquely impacted, as their respective innings loads have been inflated from 2019 by large, unsafe margins.  Hurlers are limping toward the 162-inning ERA title qualification threshold, which often serves as the entry point for Cy Young Award consideration. I also use that figure as a qualification for my annual Contact Manager of the Year hardware, bestowed upon the pitcher in each league who posts the lowest Adjusted Contact Score. In other words, based on the exit speed and launch angle of all batted balls allowed, these are the hurlers who “should have” yielded the least damage on balls in play.  Below, I’ll run down the current top five in the AL race, and later this week, repeat the process for NL hurlers. My population of pitchers considered were those who qualified for the ERA title as of August 31. The thing is, for a variety of reasons, fully five of those 24 pitchers no longer qualify through Sunday’s games—and three of those five are among the top contenders below (two of them pitched yesterday). It will be nip-and-tuck with regards to innings quantity for a bunch of them. Plus, some 8/31 non-qualifiers (Yankees’ Jordan Montgomery, Tigers’ Tarik Skubal, Astros’ Luis Garcia) could ultimately qualify with regular usage the rest of the way. In a nutshell, this thing is as wide open as it gets. Here is the current leaderboard. Greinke is the tortoise among hares in this race. He doesn’t strike out people anymore, but he logs plenty of innings and survives based on command and solid contact management. He earns a spot on this list despite a relatively ordinary batted ball frequency profile. His 73 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score ranks 3rd among qualifiers, and he’s also done a nice job of limiting liner (96) and grounder (81) authority. Greinke’s average 82.2 mph grounder authority allowed is the 2nd best among qualifiers, and his overall 87.3 mph mark is tied for 2nd best. He’s currently on the COVID-19 list, but only needs to make one more start to reach the 162 inning qualification threshold. The four players below are significantly less likely than Greinke to reach that mark. Here is your AL batted ball authority suppression god. His overall average authority allowed of 83.6 mph is by far the best among AL qualifiers. He’s first in that category across all batted-ball categories, at 87.1, 88.9 and 78.1 mph for flies, liners and grounders, respectively. Yarbrough’s Adjusted Line Drive (88) and Ground Ball (74) Adjusted Contact Scores also rank 1st among qualifiers. At 6.5%, his pop up rate is also the highest in the AL. The only thing keeping Yarbrough from being even higher on this list is a relatively low grounder rate. He returned to the mound yesterday and got smoked by the Red Sox in a truncated start not included in this analysis - that hurts his Contact Manager of the Year case both qualitatively and quantitatively.  Here is one of only two pitchers on this list that could have been considered a legit Cy Young and Contact Manager of the Year candidate as of August 31. Of course, both of those causes likely became moot after he was hit in the face by a line drive on August 17. I say “likely”, because his recovery is ahead of schedule and there is an outside chance he’ll pitch the 11 innings needed for ERA qualification before the regular season ends. Like Greinke, Bassitt’s batted ball frequency profile is quite ordinary, but his ability to manage contact authority has carried the day. His Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score of 76 is tied for 4th best, and his 87.8 mph average fly ball velocity allowed is tied for 2nd best. His Adjusted Grounder Contact Score of 93 ranks 5th, and his overall average authority allowed of 87.3 mph is tied with Greinke for 2nd best. Here’s to hoping for a full recovery first and foremost - and secondarily for a quick return that will allow him to earn deserved kudos for his 2021 campaign. Like Yarbrough, McCullers returned to the mound on Monday, and will be a very close call with regard to the 162-inning qualification threshold. It’s all about inducing grounders for McCullers, whose 55.7% grounder rate prior to last night’s start led AL qualifiers at over two full standard deviations above league average. His average launch angle allowed of 6.0 degrees ranks 2nd best. Though he has done a nice job of muting fly ball authority (82 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score, 6th), his overall authority management effort has been subpar. His overall 89.7 mph average velocity allowed actually ranks 3rd highest among qualifiers.  Of our five current leaders, only Lynn ranked among 2020’s Top Five AL Contact Managers. He finished 4th with an 82 Adjusted Contact Score, behind winner Hyun Jin Ryu’s 70. Like Yarbrough, Lynn is quite adept at inducing pop ups (5.3% pop up rate, over one full standard deviation better than average). Like all of those listed except for McCullers, he has thwarted fly ball authority (71 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score, best in the AL). He’s also done a nice job limiting damage on liners (78 Adjusted Line Drive Contact Score). His race to 162 innings will also be a close call - he’s likely to return from a minor knee injury sometime this week. He has a chance to rack up some Cy Young votes, but his innings workload is likely to work against him.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyblengino/2021/09/07/white-sox-lance-lynn-leads-wild-al-contact-manager-of-the-year-race/,One Advanced Metric Has White Sox’ Lance Lynn Leading AL Pitchers As MLB Season Hits Stretch Run
"Ahn Bo-hyun describes his character as sincere and charming. Yumi’s Cells, the Korean drama based on Lee Dong-gun’s popular Naver webtoon, will not be Ahn Bo-hyun’s first webtoon-based drama. However, it will be his first time playing a leading man in a k-drama romance. “It wasn’t my first time playing a character based on a webtoon because I had played Jang Geun-won in Itaewon Class, but I felt a lot of pressure because Yumi’s Cells is a very popular work,” said Ahn. “It wasn’t easy for me to portray Ku-woong because I had never acted in a romantic comedy before.” He has character in a romantic comedy only a few years ago, but only as Park Min-young’s friend in Her Private Life. Being the leading man in Yumi’s Cells provides better odds of engaging in an actual romance. “All the characters I played so far usually had crushes,” said Ahn. “Ku-woong is different from those characters in many ways. In Yumi’s Cells, I’ll be showing many new sides. I can’t tell you more because I don’t want to spoil anything, but please look forward to it.” In Yumi’s Cells, Yu-Mi, played by Kim Go-Eun, is a single woman, who finds it difficult to express her feelings. Cells in her brain express different emotions and help her figure out how she feels. It can be a complicated process. The psychological romance ran for five years and had over three billion views, making it one of Naver’s most popular webtoon series. Since fans have high expectations of any adaptation, Ahn worked hard to create a character that would resonate.  “In the case of a drama based on a webtoon, I consider the level of similarity between the two to be important,” he said. “I wanted to naturally connect the webtoon’s Ku-woong with the drama’s Ku-woong, and after much consideration, I was able to create my own version of the character.” Stills of Yumi’s Cells reveal a character who looks quite different from the bleached blonde bully Ahn played in Itaewon Class or the loyal sidekick he played in Her Private Life. Ahn was attracted to the role of Ku-woong because of his character’s charm and sincerity. Ahn's character has only ever loved one woman, Yu-mi. “Ku-woong is a straightforward man who only loves one woman and only thinks about what he likes,” said Ahn. “In a way, he may seem frustrating and you might wonder why he acts the way he does, but that shows that he is a pure and honest character. He does his best in what he likes and he is sincere. I think that’s his biggest charm. I tried to portray the images that come to mind when people think of Ku-woong, such as his beard and long hair. I believe this will help the viewers be more immersed in the drama and enjoy it.” Whether he’s creating a villain or a more sympathetic character, the process is similar and the results convincing. “I try to become the character. In order to focus on and empathize with the character, I tried to become him as much as possible by making up stories about his past and looking for similarities between him and me,” said Ahn. “In the case of Nam Eun-gi in Her Private Life, he was so similar to me that I was able to portray him naturally. Jang Geun-won in Itaewon Class was an antagonist, but I made a narrative of the character by coming up with reasons why he could only grow up like that.” Early in his career Ahn failed more than a few auditions, but he didn’t let himself get discouraged.  “Because I wasn’t young, I had to invest more time and effort than others,” he said. “I thought it was only natural to fail in auditions, and the many failures and wounds were a good stimulus and driving force for me to continue to take challenges. I was able to do my best in every audition because I had already hit rock bottom and had nothing to lose. And at that moment, my focus was on growing slowly, step by step, rather than succeeding.” Since making his acting debut in 2014, Ahn has created memorable characters in a series of dramas that also includes Descendants of the Sun, Dokgo Rewind and Kairos.  “I was lucky to work on great projects and I’m grateful for that,” he said. “Yumi’s Cells is also a great project.”  The Studio Dragon production will be the first Korean drama to combine live-action and 3D animation.  “I believe the viewers will find the combination of live-action and animation especially refreshing and enjoyable,” said Ahn. “I’m also looking forward to the viewers liking and sympathizing with each and every cell of Yumi and Ku-woong.” Ahn’s next project is the drama My Name, which also stars Han So-hee and Park Hee-soon.  “My Name is a Netflix 
  
  NFLX 
  original series where the main character Ji-woo becomes an undercover member of a crime organization and infiltrates the police to avenge and reveal the secrets behind her father’s death,” said Ahn. “The drama depicts the harsh truth revealed in the process. I play Jeon Pil-do who is an intense and masculine drug investigation detective, and a man of principle. He suspects Ji-woo, who has secrets, but works with her as her partner. I’ll be able to show you an action noir that’s new and different.” My Name, which is slated for release in October, will be screened at the 26th Busan International Film Festival in the newly created On Screen section.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2021/09/07/ahn-bo-hyun-embraces-romantic-comedy-in-webtoon-inspired-yumis-cells/,Ahn Bo-Hyun Embraces Romantic Comedy In Webtoon-Inspired ‘Yumi’s Cells’
"The apparent RQ-180 over The Philippines. An aircraft that appears to be the U.S. Air Force’s secret RQ-180 stealth spy drone has been photographed flying over the Philippines. The photo appears to back up reporting that the jet-powered, batwing RQ-180—in essence a weaponless, pilotless stealth bomber—is flying from Guam for operations around China. Michael Fugnit, a self-described “skywatcher,” was in Sorogon, in Luzon south of Manila, when he saw—but didn’t hear—an aircraft high overhead. His photo, which quickly circulated on social media, depicts a flying wing aircraft trailing a contrail.  The shape and contrail match those in a photo that plane-spotter Rob Kolinsky snapped near Edwards Air Force Base in California in October.  They also match the description of the RQ-180 that has been emerging in the media since Aviation Week reporters Amy Butler and Bill Sweetman broke the news of the RQ-180’s existence back in late 2013. The RQ-180, which reportedly is a Northrop Grumman product, meets an obvious need on the part of the U.S. Air Force for long-range, penetrating aerial reconnaissance in highly defended enemy air space.  Satellites see everywhere but their tracks are predictable and inflexible. Non-stealthy drones such as Northrop’s RQ-4 Global Hawk are vulnerable to air defenses—as Iran proved when it shot down one of the drones in 2019.  The Air Force operates at least one other stealth spy drone, the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel. But the RQ-170 is small—just 66 feet from wingtip to wingtip. The Sentinel’s small size translates into limited altitude and range performance.  The RQ-170 also is compromised. One of the drones crashed on the Iran-Afghanistan border in December 2011. Iranian agents quickly scooped up the wreckage. Iranian industry quickly produced copies of the drone, of dubious quality. The RQ-180—which crews reportedly call “Shikaka” after a fictional bat—does what satellites, Global Hawks and Sentinels cannot do. With its estimated 130-foot wingspan, it flies high over a distance of potentially thousands of miles, on short notice and through enemy defenses, if necessary. Think of the RQ-180 as an enabler. The Air Force has 20 B-2s and is in the process of acquiring up to 149 new B-21s, also from Northrop. The stealth bombers in theory could strike targets within range of Chinese air-defenses.  But their crews need to know where the targets are. That gets harder when the targets—army units, warships, missile-launchers and aircraft on the ground—can move. RQ-180s could keep track of mobile Chinese forces for the B-2s and B-21s to strike. The Air Force for years has been building up its Pacific stealth drone force. According to a redacted annual report from the Air Force’s Air Combat Command, the USAF back in 2009 began staging RQ-170s in Guam. The RQ-180s reportedly began arriving around 2016, when the Air Force’s 9th Operations Group based at Beale Air Force Base in California—the stealth drone’s main operator—set up a detachment in Guam. Air Force RQ-4s and U.S. Navy MQ-4Cs—naval Global Hawks—also fly from Guam and frequently appear on open-source flight trackers that log planes’ radio transponders.  It’s unclear how many RQ-180s the Air Force possesses, how quickly the Air Force is buying additional copies or how much each RQ-180 costs.  Aviation Week claimed there were seven RQ-180s in service as of 2019. If the RQ-180s replace RQ-4s on a one-for-one basis, the Air Force eventually could buy two or three dozen of the type. If the stealth spy drone is as expensive as the B-21 is, it might cost half a billion dollars per copy.  As recently as this summer, the Air Force was assuring lawmakers the service safely could retire the RQ-4 because it’s “bringing on … a family of systems” for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, according to Lt. Gen. David Nahom, deputy chief of staff for plans and programs. That new family of systems should be fully operational some time between 2027 and 2029, Nahom said. But if Fugnit’s photo is any indication, the RQ-180 already is operational—at least in a limited capacity.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/07/americas-new-stealth-drone-appears-to-be-operational-near-china/,America’s New Stealth Drone Appears To Be Operational Near China
"Charging a Tesla at a gas station using Tesla's CHAdeMO adapter. Tesla’s 
  
  TSLA 
  Supercharger network is by far the best fast charging network out there in almost every respect, but the number of DC Fast stations using CCS and CHAdeMO has been growing quickly lately, and it turns out it’s much more valuable than you would think to get Tesla’s $400 adapter to make use of those stations if you like to do road trips off the main highways. In many ways, it’s like getting a car with longer range, and less range anxiety. I just completed a 24 day road trip making extensive use of this adapter and learned many things about its problems and value. The adapter can be hard to get — it costs $400 and Tesla often is out of stock. On eBay they are known to sell for much more. It’s also fairly bulky. A few agencies offer them for rent, but the best plan may be to get together with 3-5 Tesla owning neighbors or friends to share one. The cost is then quite low and pays for itself in one trip. You just need a system to let people book it for their road trips — you probably don’t need it driving around your own town. And it’s definitely a lot cheaper than the $10,000 extra for a long range battery! While CHAdeMo stations have far fewer chargers and are slower, more expensive, less reliable and harder to use than Tesla stations, the DC Fast networks have taken the strategy of installing more stations with fewer chargers. Stations with just 1-2 chargers are common, while Tesla superchargers tend to have 8 to 32 chargers at each one, making waits rare and short if they happen, and also making charger outages unimportant. This means you while you might find Tesla chargers 150 miles apart on rural highways, you might find 2 to 4 DC Fast stations in between those two Tesla chargers. You don’t need them — your Tesla will get you between the two stations — but they offer you options. In particular they offer you the very desirable option to change your mind and take side trips.  This map shows the west coast with Tesla superchargers in orange and CHAdeMO stations in blue. It ... [+] is derived from Plugshare.com On my trip I drove from Eugene to Grant’s Pass in Oregon. That’s about 140 miles (with hills) and if you charge up at one you’ll make it to the other. But if you don’t charge up fully, or decide to take side trips, you might not make it. This limits your options and also creates anxiety. I charged up less than full at the north end of Eugene, but then visited various friends in town and stayed in a hotel. I could have backtracked to north Eugene but instead I just headed south. I would barely make Grant’s Pass but I did not have to worry, because there are 5 different CHAdeMO stations along the way, though only one has reasonable pricing. (More on that later.) I used it for 5 minutes to let me do what I wanted to do when I got to Grant’s Pass before charging. Charging with CHAdeMO at an empty Electrify America station in Oregon. As is not unusual, the ... [+] station was empty and as is also not unusual, the first type of attempt at authenticating didn't work. This is just one example of the value of having access to these chargers. By removing the “can I make it?” anxiety when you do anything but point to point driving, they ease the trip even if you never have to use them. This mirrors a result found in the earliest days of EVs in Japan. Early EVs had only 100 miles (or less) of range and range anxiety was a real thing in daily driving. (Range anxiety today doesn’t exist for most driving and is only found on rural road trips.) They found that if they installed early charging stations around town, the drivers all felt better and used their cars much more — even though they weren’t actually charging at the stations. Drivers got better use of their cars knowing they would not have the risk of getting stranded. In addition to side trips, you can make more long stops without much concern. Ideally, if you make an overnight stop anywhere, it’s nice to find a hotel with Level 2 charging and wake up fully charged. If you don’t find that, however, there are many places in between superchargers you might stop with a fairly low charge, giving you anxiety and limitations. This can be fixed if there is local CHAdeMO.  Once on this trip, the adapter did save us. Driving from Vancouver to Victoria, taking the ferry, we were running late for our reservation. The Tesla had a bug in that it thought taking the ferry used up energy in the battery, but even so we were right on the line. There is a supercharger at the ferry terminal, but we could not afford to stop or we would miss our precious reservation. So we boarded as the car complained we were doomed, but we stopped at a (our first) CHAdeMO station, ironically at a gas station, to pick up a few minutes charge and be certain of making the supercharger. (Because many people report that Teslas can go 20 miles below “zero,” we probably would have made it, but it’s not a bet you want to take.) It was nice not to worry. This particular trip included British Columbia. Unlike much of the USA, the CHAdeMO adapter is a must in that province. Tesla has only built superchargers along the Trans-Canada Highway, but BC Hydro and other entities have put many CHAdeMO stations in all sorts of places in the southern half of the province. There are other regions of Canada where this is also true. This includes stations at many “rest stops,” many of which are available at no cost. It also includes some 25kw stations, which are obviously very slow, even compared to 50kw regular CHAdeMO, but which may be the only charging on that highway, and are always free. With these stations we were able to drive all over the province, which would simply not be practical without the adapter. There are places in the USA where DC Fast stations can be found far from Tesla Superchargers, such as the “Loneliest road in America” — US 50 across Nevada, parts of CA99 in the California Central Valley, John Day in Central Oregon and a few others. In my prior road trips I ran into situations 3 times when the adapter would have made things easy that were hard, or possible that were impossible. But the Tesla network is good enough that this should be rare. However, if you want to go to those places, you need the adapter for reasons over and above those described. It surprises me that Tesla sells these adapters to customers. Instead, it should donate them to be installed at CHAdeMO stations it identifies are useful to Tesla drivers because they are far from Superchargers. Tesla maintains their charging network not to make money, but to sell cars by convincing customers they can get charging anywhere. Donating these adapters would be a super cheap way to expand the capabilities of the cars. This is particularly true for the stations I just named in places Teslas can’t go. If, for some strange reason, Tesla does not wish to donate them, the owners of the charging stations should want to buy them to get more business, but failing that, Tesla could easily charge drivers a fee to use the adapters that would quickly pay for them. One CHAdeMO network, EVgo, has bought a small number of the Tesla adapters and put them at their stations. They are mounted on a retractable cable at the side of the station. Right now they have put these adapters in foolish places — locations near superchargers — where they won’t get much use. But this can change. They won’t get much use where they are because CHAdeMO sucks. Having extolled the virtues of having the adapter, I must now point out the various problems about using it. The first is that it only supports 50kw — even at the rare 100kw CHAdeMO stations. Worse, you don’t even get 50kw — normal is about 42kw, which can sometimes rise to 49kw by the end of a charge. Sometimes you get even less, I have seen as low as 26kw even on a discharged battery. This is not quite as bad as it seems, because while Tesla’s chargers will start you out at 140kw to 190kw depending on the station, they only do that for a very short time, and as the battery fills, they drop down to be close to 50kw and even below. So while you might think a 250kw Tesla station could fill you up 5 times faster than a 50kw station, it’s closer to twice as fast. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but Tesla stations are already too fast — it’s almost impossible to finish a meal at a 250kw station without having to leave your plate to go move your car. As such, while you don’t want to do it every day, filling up at 50kw is tolerable. The DC Fast (by which I mean CHAdeMO and CCS, even though technically Superchargers are also DC Fast) networks are often quite a bit less reliable than one would like. This is complicated by the fact that many stations have just 1-2 chargers. That means a breakdown can often shut down of halve the capacity of a station, which can be a serious problem. Repairs are often slow to come because DC Fast charging is not really a business. Most stations are there for some other reason than to profitably sell electricity, so nobody is motivated to give top notch service at them. The biggest problems, though, are not breakdowns but authentication problems. Telsa did it right — the car communicates with the charger. You literally plug and play. Most DC Fast stations require you to have a card, or download an app and have internet connectivity, or get them on the phone. Reviews of stations are rife with stories of people who could not get a station to turn on, or who had to spend a fair bit of time doing it. It’s terrible and hopefully will be improved. Some are better than others but you don’t get to choose who runs the charger you are at. A good plan for operators of charging stations would be to provide power for a few minutes without authentication, and let the person complete their authentication while charging. The losses would be minimal, and shortening charging sessions is good for both customer and charger (who wants more througput at stations.) The free 25kw chargers were broken, so we took slow charging while at the visitor center of Mt. ... [+] Robson Provincial Park. The Mountain had a cloud as it usually does. Drive into Jasper that night aborted. Free price is nice but dependable is better. The strategy of more, smaller stations that provides the value described above comes with a curse. If you need a station, and it’s broken, you may be in a bad situation. You don’t just move to the next charger over. This hit us as Mt. Robson Provincial Park on the way into Jasper National Park. The free dual-unit station had one unit off and the other not working for CHAdeMO. We could not go into Jasper that day. Checking Plugshare, it was still not fixed weeks later. This doesn’t happen most of the time, but even some of the time is a problem. (One report says if you reverse Tesla’s instructions on plugging the adapter to the charger first, then to the car, this unit will work.) DC Fast stations are often quite expensive, too, and in many cases they charge by the minute which is very frustrating when they refuse to give you the power they are rated for. Particularly odd are the stations that charge a flat fee (like $7.50 in Oregon) or a base fee plus a per minute or per kwh fee. These stations are grossly overpriced if you just want a 10 minute stop to give you extra range, though they can be reasonably priced if you are doing the 75 minute long “fill up.” Expect to pay 3 to 5 times what you pay at home for electricity. Tesla stations have also recently changed prices, and some are now quite expensive if you use them during “peak times” which can mean daytimes or afternoon and early evenings based on location. Electricity costs 3x as much then on the grid. Owners of older Teslas get free use of Superchargers, and people who did referrals get free credits — I have yet to pay cash for Supercharging. As noted, in some places there are also free chargers. Level 2 slow charging is often free. DC Fast charging is rarely free, but is free at BC Rest Stops and some other places. The smaller size of stations would make it more likely they fill up, and that there could be very, very long waits. At present that doesn’t seem to happen much at all, because almost all EV road trippers are Tesla drivers. When that changes it will be interesting. Electrify America is now putting in larger stations to help. If you got to a 2-charger station and 4 cars were waiting, you could be sitting around for hours, which is not acceptable. (Fortunately you might have enough juice to make the next station, but there is no reservation system to assure you there is no wait there.) In BC the only time I saw a crowd was when 3 Teslas were present at a free two-charger CHAdeMO station on the remote road to Prince Rupert. Free is great but comes with downsides — everybody stops for a free top-up. Tesla is going to turn on Superchargers on this route in the future. Tesla sells the adapter, but they don’t give it any support. They don’t put the charging stations on their charging map, won’t plan routes using them and even will pop up alerts about how you are too far from charging when you aren’t with the adapter. Use A Better Route Planner instead. Tesla offers no way to engage the “battery precondition” which speeds up fast charging, and oddly, they request a lower charging current when the battery is low, and a bit more when it is about 80% full — the opposite of how the Superchargers work. Another issue is that of the two competing “standards,” the Asian CHAdeMO and the USA/Euro CCS, CHAdeMO lost that fight. Even Nissan, its champion, is switching to CCS. Electrify America, the largest DC Fast network in the USA, now builds stations with 4 or 8 CCS plugs and only one CHAdeMO. They have announced that next year, they will stop putting on the CHAdeMO, stranding owners of Leafs, some Kias, and no longer helping Tesla adapter owners. CCS handles up to 350kw and is starting to compete with Tesla by including a payment protocol (found in only a few cars and stations at present.) In time, other than having a bulky plug, it will come to match Tesla. Even so, there are enough CHAdeMO stations out there to make the adapter very useful, even if it won’t grow in use much beyond 2022. Tesla has a CCS adapter in Korea, and there is a buggy Chinese 3rd party one, so some day you will get that adapter instead of the CHAdeMO. Tesla should just buy back all the adapters it sold if it follows the strategy of providing them to all those stations. If the stations all have them, there is no reason for drivers to carry one. It’s not that surprising CHAdeMO lost outside of Asia. The connector is immense, and uses a different socket than the Level 2 connector, so each car needs two sockets. The CCS connector is almost as huge but adds on to the main connector. Tesla managed to do all types of charging in one sleek connector smaller than the J1772 slow charging connector all other cars have. It’s surprising that when Tesla did it right and did it earlier, that nobody learned. Because the only CHAdeMO cars out there capable of road trips are recent Nissan Leafs, it turns out that the largest user of these stations are Teslas with the adapter, even though only a few people have them. I recommend the forming of a club to share an adapter. Most people only road trip a few weeks a year, and you only need it on road trips, so it should not be hard to share, though “prime” season in the summer may have contention. A club with 8 people and 2 adapters might be more robust, and if 3 people needed to road trip the club could subsidize use of a rental, or buy another one and expand the club. Of course, it would be better if Tesla let you stop at a Tesla dealer to borrow or rent one on your way out on a road trip, and better still if Tesla just mounted them at the CHAdeMO stations. If they want, they can just bill you a fee every time you use it and even make a profit, but they should not. If you can charge at your house or office, you never need fast charging in your own town. It’s only for road trips. It turns out that as a driver, the result of this adapter is close to what you want. You want large, fast stations every 150 miles or less, and smaller, slower stations in between those stations and out in the rural areas away from the main highways. The slow stations are only rarely used to fully fill up a car. Rather they give you extra range. You take a side trip when you feel like it, and top up with only enough for that side trip at the remote stations, getting enough to make it to the big fast station where you will charge fast with no wait. Indeed, at the small stations, they should be set that anybody who wants to do an hour long fill-up has to unplug for somebody needing the 5 minute boost so nobody has to wait. These slower 50kw stations are much cheaper to make and need much less power. Great places to put them could include RV parks (which already have large electrical hookups, and could use a special station that measures how much current is going to the RVs and only offers the extra.) Other places you stop for 10 to 30 minutes like stores and restaurants could be good choices to. The result would be worry free road trips not just on the main highways, but out in the country, which is where the best road trips happen. Today, there are some very important roads which lack any fast charging, and for EVs to become superior to gasoline in every way, this needs to be fixed. While the adapter is useful in giving you more options and less anxiety almost everywhere, here is a list of some areas in the west where the adapter makes trips possible that are difficult or impossible without it in a SR+ Tesla. Routes as subject to change as new charging is installed. It is also worth noting that there are many routes that only Teslas can do that DC Fast cars will have much trouble with as well. Many of these are much easier if you pay the extra $10,000 for the long range Tesla — but the adapter is only $400.   Stay tuned for more in a 3-part series on electric vehicle road trips. Next — having a 12v compressor fridge would be a perfect match for an EV, if Telsa hadn’t mucked it up!

"Last Crumb has closed a $1 million seed round to expand production of its luxury cookies line. Matthew Jung was reluctant at first to join Last Crumb, a luxury cookies brand that sells street fashion- and celebrity culture-inspired premium treats for $140 per curated box of 12 cookies online, as chief executive — for much the same reason why many still find it hard to believe consumers would pay nearly $12 a piece for the most the popular snack of all time. The direct-to-consumer brand’s sales to-date, however, dispels all that suspicion: Designed by Truffl branding agency, Last Crumb cookies are packaged in a similar style of fine wines or luxury fashionwear, and are handmade in limited batches using high quality ingredients. The company has sold over $1 million worth of cookies through weekly drops within just three months, and the number of shoppers on its waitlist continues to increase dramatically over time. Bonding over high-end, luxury experience with everyday snacks for over a decade, Derek Jaeger cofounded Last Crumb alongside digital marketing veteran Alana Arnold after spending nearly two years formulating and perfecting their recipes produced through a proprietary three-day dough preparation process. “We use the best ingredients, and we built a baking system specifically tailored to direct-to-consumer,” said Jaeger. “It was an OCD approach to every single flavor and cookie that we put out there.” These 12 flavors, ranging from the most common chocolate chip to cinnamon toast crunch and birthday cake, also put on an edgy spin on traditional cookies when it comes to naming — “The Madonna” for the peanut butter and milk chocolate flavor, and “Donkey Kong” that combines the creaminess of ivory white chocolate, thick pudding and marshmallows, to name a few. The packaging of Last Crumb, designed by branding agency Truffl, is to create the similar consumer ... [+] experience with premium wines. The goal is to “give every cookie a story that comes to life with every bite,” according to Arnold. “We wanted this to be like a conversation starter that brings people together, as our tagline goes ‘cookies are so good that your grandmother will disown you’ — we stand by that.”  Last Crumb’s strategy centered around premium experience, storytelling and exclusivity has proven effective in cultivating a loyal fan base who are actively sharing and engaging with its products across social media. “We have spent zero dollars on marketing,” said Jung, “because these social posts and videos of unboxing [our cookies] have a really interesting compounding flywheel effect — the more people we sell cookies to, the more people are talking about us.” Now with a fresh capital injection of just over $1 million led by a group of high-profile food and beverage entrepreneurs, advisors, and venture capitalists, the company, also known to offer the Rolex or Saint Laurent of cookies, is expected to expand production capacity and capabilities, in addition to hiring new employees, which together will help triple its revenues in the near future. These investors include globally renowned entertainer, Zedd; Electric Feel Ventures’ founder Austin Rosen; cofounders of TRUFF Hot Sauce, Nick Ajluni and Nick Guillen; founder of Larry & Lenny’s Cookies, Barry Turner through Talisker Ventures; founders of The Stable, Nik Larsen and Chad Hetherington; Nik Sharma; Room 9; Riverside Ventures; and private equity investor Michael Silverstein. Last Crumb plans to roll out 80 flavors in total over time with a goal to prioritize consumer ... [+] experience.  Riverside Ventures attributes Last Crumb’s weekly sellout to its 100% digital playbook and ability to keep consumers excited. “It's amazing to see people miss out on their weekly cookie drop and become more motivated and enthusiastic to get them the following week,” the VC firm commented. “It has a similar feel to SoulCycle customers logging on the second bikes open. The demand after only a couple of months on the market is mind boggling.” Silverstein, who has been a board member of a myriad of high-growth CPG brands including Better Booch Kombucha, believes Last Crumb cookies deliver technical, functional and emotional benefits. “With Last Crumb, tasting is believing,” he said in a statement. “This is a product built on better ingredients, better recipes, and creativity… No mass packaged goods company could imagine the kaleidoscope of chocolates, caramelized butter, Maldon sea salt, lemon, espresso, macadamia nuts, caramels, vanilla, fluffy marshmallows. It’s like a wizard with magical recipes has come to your door.” Over the next 18 months, Last Crumb will continue to focus on brand building while expanding its production, fulfillment at a facility in California that’s already seven times the size of its previous plant. The team will ultimately develop 80 flavors in total that will be introduced to consumers over time, according Jung. But one thing will remain the same — customer experience always comes first. ""If we can pay off the customer experience, we can pay off building an amazing brand. Sales will come organically, and then the right opportunities will present themselves,” said Jung, “We don’t have any factory machine lines cutting and spitting out cookies that are perfectly molded; people make these, and we’re shipping a lot of boxes in a pretty expedited way so they can maintain freshness.” Commenting on Last Crumb’s future growth trajectory, he added: “We haven't even scratched the surface yet. I think that our values won’t change, regardless of the channel that we might explore down the road.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2021/09/07/fresh-cash-injection-into-last-crumb-shows-why-cpg-should-prioritize-brand-building-in-the-age-of-direct-to-consumer/,Fresh Cash Injection Into Last Crumb Shows Why CPG Should Prioritize Brand Building In The Age Of DTC
"ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JUNE 14: Clint Capela #15 and John Collins #20 of the Atlanta Hawks celebrate ... [+] their 103-100 win over the Philadelphia 76ers in game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals at State Farm Arena on June 14, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) Fresh off a surprise run to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Atlanta Hawks are now aiming to build a sustainable contender. After agreeing to a five-year, $125 million extension with restricted free agent John Collins in early August, the Hawks signed center Clint Capela to a two-year, $46 million extension last Wednesday, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Collins, Capela and star guard Trae Young, who signed a five-year max extension worth up to $207 million last month, are now all under contract through at least the 2024-25 season. With Kevin Huerter also eligible for an extension this offseason and De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish becoming extension-eligible next summer, the Hawks will soon have more difficult financial decisions to make. However, their team-building strategy might be light-years ahead if they're factoring in the likelihood of a new collective bargaining agreement and new national television contracts in upcoming years. In March, CNBC's Jabari Young reported the NBA might seek a ""$75 billion rights package, up from its current $24 billion deal"" when its contracts with Disney 
  
  DIS 
  and WarnerMedia expires after the 2024-25 season. ""One person familiar with sports media deals"" told Young that the NBA ""could get $70.2 billion over nine years, using metrics including total viewer hours, which helps networks determine the value of sports league rights."" If the NBA does succeed in tripling its national TV contract, players and teams will benefit from that windfall, too. Those revenues get factored into the league's basketball-related income, of which players are guaranteed between 49 and 51 percent each season in the current CBA. That could have major team-building ramifications moving forward. New national TV contracts set the stage for one of the biggest free-agent coups in NBA history back in 2016, as Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk experienced firsthand. The league's current nine-year, $24 billion agreement with Disney and WarnerMedia was nearly triple what it received from its previous deal. When the National Basketball Players Association rejected the NBA's cap-smoothing proposal in the wake of that deal, the salary cap jumped an unprecedented $24 million between the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons. That gave the Golden State Warriors enough cap space to sign Kevin Durant away from the Oklahoma City Thunder, and they promptly went on back-to-back championship runs. Before the Hawks hired him in May 2017, Schlenk was the assistant general manager of the Warriors, so he's well aware of how a massive cap spike can impact a team's free-agent fortunes. If the players union again rejects any cap-smoothing proposals from the NBA, a similar cap spike might occur following the 2024-25 season. Depending on how much the league receives from its new TV deals, it might even be more drastic than the 2016-17 version.  The NBA went from receiving slightly more than $900 million annually from Disney and WarnerMedia under its previous contract to roughly $2.66 billion per year. If the league again triples its annual take-home rate, it would be adding around $5 billion to the BRI pot every season. The cap rose $24 million in 2016-17 with less than a $2 billion annual increase in national TV revenue, so one can only imagine the effect that a $5 billion jump would have. There's no guarantee that the NBA will successfully land its desired $75 billion deal, especially with ratings stagnating in recent years. Upcoming CBA negotiations could also throw a wrench into a one-year cap explosion, too. The CBA is currently set to expire following the 2023-24 season, but both the league and players union can opt out of it one year prior. Team owners could make cap-smoothing an integral part of the next CBA negotiations, knowing that its national TV contracts will soon be up for renewal. They also might seek to take back a bigger share of BRI from players, which would limit how much the cap rises each year. As the NBA digs its way out of financial losses stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming CBA discussions and new national TV deals will loom large over long-term team-building strategies. No one can say for certain what the league's landscape will look like in a few years' time, but the salary cap will likely be far higher than it is now. The Hawks may be uniquely poised to benefit from that. Capela's new extension ends after the 2024-25 season, and Collins has a $26.6 million player option in 2025-26 that he figures to decline if the cap does soar because of the new TV deals. However, Young's extension runs through at least the 2025-26 season—he has a $39.3 million player option in 2026-27—and new deals for Huerter, Reddish, Hunter and Onyeka Okongwu could run beyond the 2024-25 season as well. The Hawks might have to eat huge luxury-tax bills for a few years until then, although letting Danilo Gallinari and Bogdan Bogdanovic walk once their respective contracts expire would help decrease the financial blow. Hemorrhaging money might be more palatable if the Hawks can get their young players under new long-term contracts before the salary cap explodes because of the new CBA and/or new national TV deals.   Team owner Tony Ressler tried to keep expectations in check while speaking to reporters following the Hawks' surprise playoff run. ""What we are trying to achieve is literally keeping our best players, as you could imagine, trying to make clear that we’re going to have to spend a lot more than we have this season,"" Ressler said. ""We fully expect that. I’m not sure we’re going to be able to keep every single player that we want to keep. Pretty good bet, pretty good assumption we will not."" The Hawks might not be able to keep their entire core together long term, but it would behoove them to extend as many of their young players as possible. What might look like overpays now could turn into massive bargains if the salary cap jumps by tens of millions of dollars in the coming years. The Hawks enter the 2021-22 season with the fifth-best odds of any Eastern Conference team to make it to the 2022 NBA Finals, per FanDuel Sportsbook. They're built to win now.  If they sign Huerter, Reddish, Hunter and/or Okongwu to extensions over the next year or two and lock in potential long-term bargains, their unexpected success from this past season may prove to be sustainable, too.

"Nikki Elliott (left) and Michelle Razavi (right) cofounded and bootstrapped collagen-boosted ... [+] nutrition bars startup ELAVI during the pandemic. Functional bites startup, ELAVI, made with sustainably sourced collagen and plant-based protein, and entirely boostrapped by an all-women and POC team during the pandemic has just closed a $500,000 pre-seed round led by Trousdale Ventures, onboarding several renowned CPG industry leaders as its strategic advisors. What seems to be an insignificant raise for many food and beverage entrepreneurs was a daunting task for Michelle Razavi, who had very limited access to capital at the beginning, while preparing to launch the company right before COVID hit with Nikki Elliott — a fellow fitness instructor and friend she met at Equinox.  Bonding over their shared passion for nutritional snacks and on-the-go lifestyle, the pair set out to build ELAVI, which combines their last names and aspires to elevate people’s lives through better-for-you ingredients, from the ground up with their personal savings. They initially invested a few thousand dollars in formulating the product with a co-manufacturer using dates and honey as sweeteners, and sold out thousands of bars within 10 weeks through a soft launch in 2020, according to Razavi.  “A year and a half later, we have three flavors out in the market — chocolate chip cookie, chocolate goji berry, and blueberry vanilla crisp — sold in Erewhon, Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
  and on our own website,” she said. “Collectively, we have sold just under $200,000 in revenue to-date,” noting how ELAVI’s average order has increased from 5,000 bars to 60,000 during the period. “We knew something was there,” Razavi said, while recalling how ELAVI’s early success was attributed to a perfect combination between Elliott’s financial skills gained from her previous job at PwC, and her consumer and retail technology savviness through working at Sephora. The unavoidable challenge for Razavi and Elliott to scale their business was convincing investors ELAVI can be the next breakout brand in an already saturated nutrition bars category continuing to be filled with innovations. The duo decided to try their luck on Clubhouse, an increasingly popular audio platform for early-stage CPG founders to support each other and seek for mentorship from experts. “The pitching process was definitely iterative,” Razavi said. “I learned to be very organized early on, and to test constantly and listen to feedback from fellow entrepreneurs and investors — that approach was both quantitative and qualitative. I would also take notes whenever I heard someone talk on a panel, and then use what I learned to reach out via LinkedIn or email.” The strategy has proven effective as ELAVI successfully garnered an enthusiastic group of industry big names who are willing to support its business, including the CEO of Nuun Hydration Kevin Rutherford who later became the company’s advisor, and Enjoy Life Foods’ founder Bert Cohen who joined both as an advisor and angel investor — these contacts, Razavi stressed, are usually hard to come by through regular networking or email pitches. “The biggest lesson I’ve learned on Clubhouse is to be succinct,” said Razavi. “I did a lot of practice by timing myself in 30 seconds or one minute. I'd be sweating afterwards, but [participants] couldn't see that fortunately.” Off its success on Clubhouse, ELAVI has expanded into food service channel, securing a deal with Equinox’s LA cafe partner, Earthbar, and the team plans to further use the newly raised capital to fuel product expansion, distribution growth, and digital innovation. “Our goal is to ultimately become a household name,” Razavi said.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2021/09/07/how-this-women-led-collagen-bars-startup-bootstraps-during-the-pandemic-and-convinces-nuun-hydration-enjoy-life-foods-execs-to-believe-in-its-mission/,"How This Women-Led Collagen Bites Startup Bootstraps During The Pandemic And Convinces Nuun Hydration, Enjoy Life Foods Execs To Believe In its Mission"
"Coal is the low-hanging fruit My entire career, people have talked about ‘low-hanging fruit’ in reference to various energy policies thought to be most attractive, some of which really are low-hanging fruit (energy efficiency), some not so much (coal-to-liquids) and others that had gone rotten (switching power generation to coal). But there’s always a sense that policies range from easy to hard to hardest. Unfortunately, policy advocates often ignore economics as irrelevant (‘you can’t put a price on health’) or blindly push a favored solution (‘electric vehicles are the future’).  But the reality is that a lot of low hanging fruit is out there, but not being picked. Just as a starter, the world uses about 8 billion metric tonnes of coal a year and the U.S. nearly 500 million, even last year during the pandemic. One of the easiest GHG reductions in the past decade occurred when the U.S. power sector switched from 44% coal and 24% gas in 2010, to 19% coal and 40% gas last year. It was done without any government support—indeed, large amounts of taxes paid to the government by gas producers—and at a savings to consumers.  A decade ago, the consulting firm McKinsey created a ‘supply’ curve for CO2 reductions and they estimated that as much as an annual 10 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent could be reduced at no cost—indeed, a profit! A lot of it was relatively low tech, such as better insulation, swapping out appliances for more efficient models, and improved farm practices. The work is obviously dated given changes in technology, and there was uncertainty about some of the analysis even at the time, but it was a noble effort to prioritize GHG reduction methods by cost. Sadly, too many don’t think that matters. Any number of studies will tell you about the enormous amount of solar power that hits the earth every day, the huge wind resource off the East Coast of the United States or the amazing efficiency gains that can be made by switching to ultra-efficient automobiles—rarely mentioning the price tag.  So, let me suggest some things that would probably be relatively low-cost and many of which would be advisable by themselves. Probably the one that most appeals to me is promoting the use of GMO crops around the world, which would reduce pesticide and fertilizer usage (saving energy), but also mean more efficient use of land than many farming practices now used. This would mean less deforestation and reduce pressure on wildlife which are often more endangered by habitat loss than climate change. Oh, and hunger would decline, which seems like a laudable result, especially given famine in many places. Yes, GMOs are ‘icky’ and opposed by Antoinettes like Greenpeace (‘let them eat organic cake’), but the science proving it’s safe is far beyond settled.  Which brings us to another dual-benefit policy, reduction in energy poverty, specifically by replacing ‘biomass’ with commercial energy. Energy poverty also increases deforestation, is land and labor intensive, and bad for health (something like 1.6 million people a year die from indoor air pollution, which is burning materials like wood and dung, not natural gas). Providing electricity and fossil fuels like propane for cooking could be extremely beneficial to the over one billion people now estimated to lack access to commercial energy. (I don’t oppose solar power for the energy impoverished, but putting in a solar panel to charge people’s smartphones, while nice, is not the same as connecting them to the grid.) Amazingly, there are two things advanced economies can do that appear to be beneficial and/or relatively cheap but do not receive much attention. One: plant more trees, especially in cities. They reduce the urban heat island effect and sequester carbon. Also, by focusing on urban areas that have less foliage, you also promote social justice since by an amazing coincidence, richer areas usually have more tree cover. (Shocking, I know.) Beyond that, the use of black asphalt and roof shingles has increased the amount of solar radiation that isn’t reflected into outer space: scientists have developed newer ‘white’ materials that can be used in parking lots, rooftops and streets to reflect much more solar radiation. (And yes, I’m sure there will be people who install white rooftops and then cover them with black solar panels, but you can’t have everything.) Another policy I’ve advocated before involves reducing methane leakage. Much of the methane that enters the air is from natural sources, but ongoing research shows a very significant amount comes from the oil industry, primarily due to above-ground leaks. Since the industry itself maintains that this is doable and desirable, more aggressive moves in this direction would be extremely valuable. (Including places like Siberia and the Caspian area.) American philosopher Melvin Kaminsky once pointed out, “It’s good to be the king,” and I would certainly like to be, so that I can impose so other changes that not everybody would embrace. (The quote is from “History of the World, Part 1,” but omits the fact that it stinks for everybody else.) The use of leaf blowers for large areas makes sense to me, but I find it hard to justify carrying around one of those things just to do your front yard. (Granted, I don’t have that many trees anymore.) Also, importing water from 3,000, 4,000 or 8,000 miles away strikes me as, well, kind of dumb. (Sorry, Perrier.) Oh, yeah, waste to energy is used all over the world and, with modern equipment and (whisper—appropriate regulation) environmentally benign. Certainly much more than dumping all that junk in the ocean (which is bad all by itself) or letting children sort through rubbish heaps. And that is a much better approach to plastic waste than making everyone share aluminum straws or whatever we’re supposed to do.  I don’t know if fusion is now on this side of the horizon, or if hydrogen fuel cell cars will compete with hybrid-electric vehicles in my lifetime, but the things I’ve described above are all eminently workable, technologically feasible already, and largely economical.  But the point is that by the time we harvest all this low hanging fruit, more low-hanging fruit will grow and we’ll have better ladders (i.e., technological progress). Don’t believe it can happen: four decades ago, we were assured of the need for fast breeder reactors, and the importance of jump-starting the technology (presumably costs would have dropped with the learning curve, just like solar power!). Instead, there were numerous other approaches that obviated the need for them, including improved nuclear power plant management which raised capacity factors, discoveries of more uranium, more efficient appliances, natural gas turbines and, yes, now wind and solar (sometimes).  Of course, I’ll be called an old fuddy-duddy (or maybe, ‘Okay, boomer,’) but at my age, I’d much rather have the low hanging fruit than climb a darn ladder.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2021/09/07/why-does-biden-ignore-low-hanging-energy-fruit/,Why Does Biden Ignore Low-Hanging Energy Fruit?
"Mikel Arteta, Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi of Arsenal celebrate during the Premier League match ... [+] between Arsenal FC and Everton FC at Emirates Stadium on February 23, 2020 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Catherine Ivill/Getty Images) Arsenal’s manager Mikel Arteta is under pressure. With the Gunners bottom of the league after three games, there are plenty of calls for his head.  But after investing heavily on young players who fit a particular system and have a huge potential upside, it would be foolish to throw that all away in a knee-jerk reaction to short-term results. If Arsenal do replace Arteta, it needs to be with someone who fits their long-term strategy.  In other words, they shouldn’t make the same mistake as their North London rivals. Jose Mourinho has won trophies at pretty much every club he has been at apart from Tottenham Hotspur. He was seen as the missing ingredient that could finally win Spurs a trophy that they couldn’t manage under Mauricio Pochettino.  But instead Spurs seemed to take a step backward. Soccer consultant Mads Davidsen says this is because to reach that next level, Spurs needed capital, competency and consistency. And for a while, Spurs had none of them. In the book “How Hard Can It Be? – Strategies In Football On And Off The Pitch”, co-written with former FC Copenhagen CEO Dan Hammer, Davidsen points out that about 70% of a club’s success is down to finances, with the other 30% being made from competent management and luck. As a result, it is nearly impossible for clubs to consistently overachieve their financial reality.  Spurs couldn’t reach the top level because they couldn’t compete financially with Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs, in a large part due to building a new stadium which should help them narrow that financial gap and compete on a higher level in the long term.  Under this long-term approach, they were achieving right at the top given their budget, the only way for them to improve was for the owners to invest more. To instead fire Pochettino and then hire a manager with a completely different style as soon as Spurs had their first dip in form was incredibly short-term thinking. Tottenham Hotspur tried to take a shortcut to the top by hiring Jose Mourinho but that plan ... [+] backfired. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Basically, Spurs tried to take a shortcut by bringing in Mourinho, but that actually delayed their previous strategy. So what makes someone like Daniel Levy who is known for his business acumen, and who had the long-term foresight to go down the route of building a new stadium, suddenly make such an out-of-character decision? Davidsen says that while it sounds easy for a business-minded club owner to ignore short-term results and instead follow a long-term plan, so many clubs fail to do this. That’s partly because the people at soccer clubs who should be thinking long-term, the owners, the board, the sporting directors, all got into soccer in the first place because they want to think short-term. His book highlights this with the example of former Sunderland chairman Stewart Donald, who paid spectacularly over the odds for forward Will Grigg despite even the club’s manager Jack Ross saying Grigg wasn’t worth the money.  Spurs were set back by their short-term thinking, hiring a manager who objectively is very good, but who didn’t fit the club’s style or long-term approach. Davidsen says “very few clubs are successful when they go against their history, their DNA.” Now, Spurs’ local rivals could make the same mistake. Arsenal’s transfer market strategy recently has been to focus on young players with the potential to go right to the very top. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Director of Football Edu with new signing Ben White at London ... [+] Colney on July 30, 2021 in St Albans, England. (Photo by Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) It might not have looked like it when Ben White struggled against Premier League newcomers Brentford on the opening weekend, but many see him as being one of the best center-backs in the world in a few years. That’s why Arsenal paid more for him than Manchester United did for Raphael Varane.  The problem is, Arsenal have spent so long neglecting their long-term strategy that they are starting from a very low point, and even if their strategy works out, it will take them a few seasons before they’re challenging those at the top. Under Arsene Wenger, the Gunners overachieved while spending very little due to the construction of the Emirates. Having such a long-term coach like Wenger can help bring stability and a coherent long-term strategy. But with the strategy so closely tied to the manager, there is a risk that once they leave, the club becomes directionless. This happened at Arsenal and also at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson left. Arsenal have tried to rectify this, bringing in Edu as a technical director in 2019, and despite far too many expensive false starts like signing Willian in 2020, their investment now seems to be looking at the longer term.  The question is whether they have staff who are competent enough to pull this off. If the scouting network isn’t up to scratch then they could have recruited poorly despite their huge spending. And if the manager isn’t good enough, then they will struggle on the pitch anyway. But regardless of whether Arteta is the right man for the job, the worst thing Arsenal could do now would be to copy Spurs and hire a new manager who doesn’t fit their squad or long-term strategy. Looking for a short-term fix could instead set them back years, especially if the new manager doesn’t fit the club’s style of play and allows all their recent expensive recruitment to go to waste.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2021/09/07/tottenham-hotspurs-shortcut-to-the-top-failed-arsenal-must-avoid-the-same-strategic-mistake/,Tottenham Hotspur’s Shortcut To The Top Failed.

"El Salvador acquired roughly $21 million worth of bitcoin on Monday, President Nayib Bukele announced, buoying the crypto market ahead of making history Tuesday by becoming the first country in the world to formally adopt the digital currency as legal tender.  El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele has championed the country's use of bitcoin as currency.  El Salvador bought its first 400 bitcoins in two lots on Monday—worth an estimated $21 million based on bitcoin’s value at the time of the announcement—according to a series of tweets by Bukele. Bukele said the country had plans to buy “a lot more” when announcing the first salvo of 200 bitcoins. The purchase comes as El Salvador makes history as the first country to make bitcoin legal tender Tuesday. The law enacting the change, approved by an overwhelming majority in June, places bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar as El Salvador’s national currency. Bukele said he hopes the initiative will boost foreign investment, financial inclusion and generate jobs, and bitcoin can be used to make purchases and pay tax.  The value of bitcoin jumped around 2% to just under $53,000 on Tuesday morning following Bukele’s tweets—though the volatile token dipped around 3% later that morning—its highest value since the cryptocurrency market crashed three months ago.        El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender is controversial and questions over logistics have been raised both at home and abroad. Polls suggest most Salvadorans are against the idea and many have taken to the streets to protest the change. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said its plans may threaten an anticipated deal with the country, while some economists warn of the country becoming a haven for financial crime and there are widespread concerns over the potential environmental impact of bitcoin, which uses huge amounts of electricity. Some of these criticisms—notably environmental impact and crime, which certainly are significant problems—are often raised as if they are insurmountable and without reference to efforts to remedy the issue or context. Bitcoin could be mined using electricity generated from clean sources, for example, and crypto’s popularity among criminals makes up a small fraction of illicit financial transactions. Many are excited about the change and Bukele has been open in his hopes it will attract a new cohort of entrepreneurs to the country.  $30.

"Flights like this one aboard a Delta aircraft this summer, on which nearly every seat was filled, ... [+] yet staffed at FAA-allowed minimum staffing levels helped push negative comments on Twitter about U.S. airlines this summer to record highs, and sent the number of positive ""tweets"" tumbling. Tens of thousands of airline employees retired last year at the height of the pandemic, but airlines now are struggling to hire and train all the workers they need for the rebound in summer travel this year. KENT NISHIMURA Los Angeles Times via Getty Images You’d think that with U.S. airlines carrying roughly 10% to 20% fewer travelers this summer that those carriers would be recording some of the highest numbers of positive customer comments and lowest numbers of customer complaints ever. But you’d be wrong – waaaay wrong. One reason is that while carriers are carrying net fewer passengers than they did in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, they’re also not operating as many planes and flights. And because the vast majority of the flights that still haven’t been resumed are long-haul international flights aboard widebody jets, airlines today are, in many cases, actually carrying more people on their narrowbody domestic aircraft than was the case before the pandemic.  On top of that, virtually all airlines are doing that work with fewer staff now because they’ve not yet been able to hire and train enough new employees to replace the tens of thousands who took offers of early retirement in 2019. In 2020, industry operations shrank by 70% or more in response to the unprecedented decline in demand caused by the pandemic. So airlines encouraged large numbers of employees getting close to retirement to go ahead and leave early. Now they really could use lots of those retirees back on the front lines, but once unionized airline workers clock out and claim their retirement benefits they cannot come back. As a result, air travelers these days are feeling deprived of the attention they expect to receive. For good reason; they simply aren’t getting it. And they’re letting the rest of us hear about it via social media. This summer, on average, the 10 largest U.S. airlines lost 20.1 percentage points off their “positive Twitter comments” score from two years ago. And while those same 10 carriers’ average score for “negative Twitter comments” actually improved ever-so-slightly, two of them – Allegiant and, shockingly, Southwest, saw huge increases in negative comments about them as a percentage of all comments about them on Twitter . This unusual – perhaps even unique – analysis of U.S. airlines’ respective customer service performances was undertaken by InsureMyTrip.com, a website that provides price and policy comparisons to consumers shopping for travel insurance coverage. They analyzed more than 25,000 tweets over a two-week period between July 19 and August 2 this year and compared the results against tweets about the same 10 airlines during the corresponding two-week period in summer 2019, before the pandemic began, to discern which carriers attracted the most positive – and the most negative – tweets  . While the Department of Transportation tracks the number — and kind — of complaints lodged annually against individual airlines, that data set is regarded as an incomplete analytical tool because of the bias built into the complaint-filing system. Pleased customers have no mechanism to tell the DOT that they were, in fact, served well, or to compliment carriers for their performance in the various categories of customer service. Also, the DOT stats have no way of accounting for the natural tendency of people to file only complaints when the service was especially poor but to say nothing at all when the service they received was really good. So, InsureMyTrip researchers turned to Twitter, with its more than 330 million active users, to try to gauge both positive and negative comments about airlines tweeted out by consumers, and to dig a little deeper into which aspects of service individual carriers tended to provide better or worse, from the customers’ perspective. This summer, Alaska Airlines came in with the highest percentage of positive Tweets about its service: 43.8%. Hawaiian Airlines got the lowest (best) percentage of negative Tweets: 34.2% At the other end of the spectrum, discount carrier Spirit Airlines had the lowest percentage of positive Tweets at just 21%, while Alaska had the “best” showing in the negative Tweets competition with just 32% of the tweets about it during the analysis period being negative in nature. The most notable scores in the InsureMyTrip analysis were registered by Southwest, whose customer service historically has ranked at or near the top of the industry in various studies conducted throughout its 50 years in operation. Though the Dallas-based carrier, which began flying in 1971 as a low-cost/low fare carrier, has seen its costs rise over the years as it grew to become the biggest U.S. airline in terms of passengers boarded. But despite that growth and the higher costs that accompany being a large operator with relatively high-paid employees, Southwest has been able to maintain its reputation for providing top service.  But this summer, as the carrier tried to rebuild its huge domestic network more rapidly than most of its competitors, it has run into big service quality problems. That’s because its current workforce, which was trimmed dramatically last year by thousands of retirements, has been inadequate to provide anything more than minimal service. In fact, Southwest has struggled to even find enough workers to even staff at the minimum allowed level all the flights the company added back to its schedule as the pandemic eased. Flight attendants, pilots and gate agents in particular have complained loudly and publicly about being overworked and forced to handle more passengers and more problems than they are capable of doing at current staffing levels. In response, Southwest last week said it would scale back its aggressive recovery scheduling a bit this fall to take some of the pressure off its troops and give them the ability to provide more and better customer service. Still, the problems Southwest has had this summer are evident in the numbers from Twitter. Only 32% of the tweets about Southwest during this summer’s study period were positive, while 45.1% were negative. In the 2019 study period 69.9% of tweets about Southwest were positive, while only 30.1% were negative. That was, by a wide margin, the best positive-to-negative tweets ratio among the 10 largest U.S. airlines back in 2019. Discounter Allegiant took the biggest fall in positive vs. negative tweets this year, attracting just 27.2 positive tweets during this summer’s study period, a 38.2 percentage point decline. And its negative tweets climbed 17.87 percentage points (more than any other airline) to 53.5%.  The industry’s “Big Four” carriers – American, Delta, United and Southwest - all saw declines in the tenor of consumers’ responses on Twitter to the service they received. Only 26.8% of tweets about American this summer were positive, down from 44.21% in 2019, while 52.5% of the tweets about it this summer were negative, up from 49.35% in 2019. Delta’s percentage of positive tweets this summer took a big tumble to just 29.8%, from 51.28% in the 2019 study period. United’s decline in the percentage of positive tweets was a little smaller; to 32%, down 18.59 percentage points from 50.59 percent in 2019.  Southwest was not, by any means, the only U.S. airline that saw its customer service quality decline, per the InsureMyTrip study, because of staffing shortages coming out of the industry’s dramatic scale back in 2020. Ronni Kenoian, InsureMyTrip’s director of marketing, said “cancellations” was the most commonly-tweeted negative key word used by Twitter users during the study period this summer. United, she said, was called out for flight cancellations in just over 10% of all tweets about it this summer. That was highest among the 10 airlines in the use of that word by those posting tweets. The word “delays” was the second most heavily used negative keyword. The rise in flight cancellations and delays recently has certainly led to frustration among passengers,” she said. “As many are now considering future travel plans, we strongly encourage travelers to purchase travel insurance,” Kenoian said, putting in a plug for her company’s service. “If you get stuck at the airport for several hours, travel delay coverage may help to reimburse for meals or additional accommodations necessary during a covered delay.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielreed/2021/09/07/twitter-comments-show-that-airline-service-quality-has-bombed-this-summer-amid-widespread-staff-shortages/,Twitter Comments Show Airline Service Quality Bombed This Summer Amid Widespread Staff Shortages

(Photo by New Zealand Defence Force via Getty Images) “Shippageddon” first entered the retail industry lexicon in late 2020, describing a conflation of global supply chain issues that led many brands and retailers to be under-stocked or otherwise unable to fulfill customer demand for purchases last year. A year later, many of those issues have not been resolved, and there are new hazards to deal with. Retailers and brands are preparing for round two of Shippageddon.  In 2020, Shippageddon was driven by several factors:   The term Shippageddon was first coined in late 2020 on an episode of the retail podcast The Jason And Scot Show. ”We were talking about the likely e-commerce peak we expected from the holiday, on top of the e-commerce peak we were already seeing due to Covid-19, and we felt like retailers were likely to run into shipping capacity issues,” said the hosts of the show. And the alarm that retail experts sounded did in fact bear out. Shoppers were indeed met with stock-outs, longer delivery timelines from all carriers, and less overall discounting ahead of the holidays.    But the outlook doesn’t look much better for 2021.  The price of shipping containers has skyrocketed in 2021, along with transit times. Mike Beckham, CEO of home products brand Simple Modern, posted analysis on Twitter showing how dramatically the company’s costs and transit times have increased from Q3 2019 to Q3 2021: an increase of 122% of price per shipping container and a 105% increase in transit time.  Simple Modern is far from the only company with this experience. Salesforce

  predicts that U.S. companies will spend $163B more on ocean freight in the second half of 2021 than they did in the second half of 2020 for these exact reasons, according to Rob Garf, Vice President and General Manager of Retail at Salesforce. UPS says that delivery demand during the 2021 peak season will exceed capacity by 5 million packages per day, pointing at a major discrepancy between supply and demand for online shopping capacity.  Like last year, UPS and other last-mile carriers will impose surcharges and daily package limits on the largest shippers. Brands and retailers will also face peak-season rate hikes from the USPS which (if granted) will be in force from October 3rd to December 26 this year.  This is in addition to the permanent price increases for First-Class mail and packages which came into effect on August 29.  In 2020, many of my clients at Bobsled Marketing faced lengthy delays to get their inventory placed in Amazon warehouses and available for shoppers to purchase. Whether the brand was a 1st party supplier to Amazon or using the “Fulfillment by Amazon” program as a 3rd party seller, Amazon was often not placing purchase orders, not picking them up, or inbound shipments would take upwards of 3 weeks to unload once it arrived at an Amazon warehouse.  Email announcement shared in August with an Amazon seller explaining that they are eligible for ... [+] increased warehouse space, but with specific limitations.  This year, Amazon changed its methodology for calculating how much inventory a Seller can have at Amazon. The system uses factors like storage type (standard, oversize or clothing & footwear), the inventory performance across a sellers’ entire product catalog (an account-wide ‘Inventory Performance Index’) and in some cases, ASIN-level (SKU-level) performance. Several changes made throughout 2021 have made it hard for sellers to understand exactly what capacity they have available. And some sellers have been negatively affected by inventory storage limitations that have impacted their ability to keep items in-stock. I wrote about this in a post for Forbes in May:  Amazon Hobbles Merchants’ Prime Day Preparations With Inventory Restrictions But any issues that Amazon Sellers are facing are merely downstream impacts from Amazon’s own crunched supply chain. With its huge share of ecommerce GMV, Amazon bore the brunt of capacity issues in 2020. There are major efforts underway to ramp up Amazon’s operating capabilities this year. When reached for comment on the issue of supply chain challenges, Amazon provided the following statement: Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve invested more than $11.5 billion in COVID-19 related operating costs. We’ve increased square footage across our fulfillment and logistics network by 50%, opening dozens of new delivery stations and fulfillment centers around the world. We’ve hired over 400,000 employees in the biggest peacetime workforce ramp-up by any company in history. And we’ve spent more than $2.5 billion on pay incentives and bonuses. To counteract the conflation of negative supply chain factors, companies are investing in infrastructure and adapting their marketing approach.   Despite these efforts, a jammed-up global supply chain is a tough problem to fix. The Suez shipping canal fiasco we witnessed in March 2021 helped to illustrate just how fragile the global supply chain can be - a cut-off shipping route, lack of shipping containers, carrier ships, or trucks - all have downstream impacts for the ability to procure and distribute consumer goods. It will be another year of simply muddling through the fourth quarter of 2021 for many companies.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2021/09/07/retail-brands-gear-up-for-second-shippageddon/,Retail Brands Gear Up For Second ‘Shippageddon’
"Denis Potvin, Bryan Trottier, and Mike Bossy, members of the New York Islanders hockey team, carry ... [+] the Stanley Cup trophy in 1981. As one of the 16 Islanders who hoisted the Stanley Cup four consecutive times between 1980 and 1983, Denis Potvin basked in plenty of real-time adoration from the fans who helped turn Nassau Coliseum into “Fort Neverlose.” But while most of his teammates remained on Long Island following their retirement, Potvin embarked upon a career in broadcasting with the Florida Panthers and Ottawa Senators. He remained popular with the fans in front of whom he’d played his entire Hall of Fame career, but he didn’t get the regular reminders of what the Islanders and Nassau Coliseum meant to those who lived east of New York City’s five boroughs. It took until June, when Potvin, now retired from broadcasting, trekked to Long Island from his home in Canada for the Islanders’ final three home games at Nassau Coliseum — the trio of raucous and deafening instant classics against the Tampa Bay Lightning in the NHL semifinals — to fully understand how the building and the Islanders still resonate with the team’s fans. “I’d never sat in the seats during any of the games, obviously, but this time I’m sitting, like, in Row 8 above the penalty box, and the place is unbelievable, and I’m saying, ‘Now I know,’” Potvin said last week. “I knew, but this was another way to appreciate what this building was able to offer.” With the Islanders a little more than two months away from playing their first game at their true permanent post-Coliseum home — UBS Arena is scheduled to open for hockey Nov. 20 with the Islanders hosting the Calgary Flames — Potvin and dynasty teammate Bryan Trottier are taking one more look back at the Coliseum years with a quartet of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) produced in conjunction with Fanaply and Flux88. “It’s a culmination of all the wonderful thoughts and feelings that can come back to me now as a (67)-year-old guy looking back at my life in hockey and Long Island,” Potvin said. “I think maybe that’s the most important thing — it’s doing as much for me as it is for the people who like it and buy it.” The series, titled “Closing the Barn,” features portraits of each player by artist Kevin Briones. It includes one NFT of each player — available for $40 and limited to 80 pieces — in which Potvin and Trottier speak about their early memories at the Coliseum. New York Islanders legends Denis Potvin and Bryan Trottier are the subjects of a series of NFTs ... [+] commemorating the closing of Nassau Coliseum. Potvin discussed scoring his first two career goals in his first NHL victory Oct. 27, 1973, which also marked the Islanders’ first win over the rival Rangers. Trottier recalled the night of Oct. 11, 1975, when he made his Coliseum debut and collected a hat trick against the Kings. The friends teamed up for another NFT, priced at $250 and limited to 25 pieces, in which they talked about the decibel-busting noise at the Coliseum and how hard it was for either to hear the other despite being next to one another on the bench. Yet above the din, Potvin recalls hearing a woman yelling “Motor Potvin! Motor Potvin!” as he exited the Islanders’ zone. A fourth NFT begins with an opening bid of $2,000 and is awarded to the highest bidder. If it goes beyond $25,000, the winner spends a weekend with Potvin and Trottier. “Collectibles have really gotten sky-high since the pandemic,” Potvin said. “And this is another step, where now someone can own something that’s truly his or hers and only theirs.” The foray into NFTs for Potvin and Trottier comes at a time when the Islanders are finally creating some more memories that could rival those generated during the dynasty years. The Islanders’ back-to-back runs to the NHL semifinals the last two years marked the first time the team made it beyond the second round in consecutive seasons since the streak of five straight Stanley Cup Finals appearances ended in 1984. The Islanders turned into social media sensations this spring, when pandemic-era seating limitations were gradually lifted until more than 10,000 people — including celebrities such as Ralph Macchio and Susan Lucci as well as beer-swilling members of the New York Jets and dynasty mainstay Clark Gillies, who was captured chugging a beer and smashing the can against his head during the second-round series against the Bruins — were filling Nassau Coliseum with a 1980s-esque noise. The most memorable moment of the playoff run was created accidentally when a hiccup with the sound system forced anthem singer Nicole Raviv to rely on the crowd to sing the National Anthem before Game 4 against the Bruins. Raviv led the crowd in the Anthem prior to the next four home games. “I have a terrible singing voice,” Potvin said. “But when (ten) thousand people were all singing, with our phones lit up blasting away the National Anthem before the game and going a the top of (their) lungs, it was great. It was so great. I was so happy that I made the decision to be there.” Potvin said he hopes to be at the first game at UBS Arena, when the Islanders will likely take the ice as one of a handful of teams with legitimate Stanley Cup aspirations — and the chance to cement their own legacy, on the Island and elsewhere, for generations to come. “I think the makings are all there,” Potvin said. “I hope that it does become theirs (and) they can really embrace it the way we embraced the Coliseum. “It’s time for the young guys to go out and win their own Cup and make that building Fort Neverlose 2. I hope they can. I really do hope they can.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybeach/2021/09/07/nfts-help-denis-potvin-to-look-back-at-nassau-coliseum--and-to-bright-days-ahead-for-ny-islanders/,NFTs Help Denis Potvin Look Back At Nassau Coliseum — And To Bright Days Ahead For NY Islanders
"Some store shelves are emptying out...but others are nicely stocked. What gives? PHOTOGRAPH BY Chris ... [+] Putnam / Barcroft Studios / Future Publishing (Photo credit should read Chris Putnam/Barcroft Media via Getty Images) When it comes to who has enough merchandise to sell – and who doesn’t – the retail world seems to be settling in to a two-tier structure: The Haves and the Have-Nots Even as some big national retailers are beginning to acknowledge problems getting enough goods for their stores and online operations, others are claiming there is plenty of merchandise out there to fit their needs. This dynamic becomes ever more important as the industry moves into its crucial fourth quarter push when a disproportionate amount of its revenue is generated. It’s a fascinating dichotomy that may have as much to do with business models and merchandising strategies as it does with sources of supply or access to transportation services. While many big companies are chartering ships, loading up on inventory, moving sourcing to new areas and flying in goods for some it’s still not enough. Retailers that can buy from wide swatches of the supplier base, like off-pricers and close-out operations, seem to be generally faring better than those operations that have much more specific needs like department stores and dollar chains. But for the discount and price-sensitive end of the retail business, the increased costs associated with higher container prices, using airfreight rather than ocean shipping and generally higher labor wages throughout the process have all impacted earnings as well, causing concern with investors. Higher end retailers may be facing the same supply chain issues but because they have more room to absorb those higher costs they seem to be facing less margin profitability challenges. But what is clear throughout the entire retailing spectrum is that a problem that was still largely hypothetical for much of the pandemic era is finally catching up with some parts of the business and creating a new kind of havoc. Besides shortages, the goods that are arriving are more expensive and shoppers, fearing a return to depleted stocks of basics like toilet paper and other staples, are starting to hoard once again, just as they did in the spring of 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic was raging.  Clearly the ship has hit the fan.  Dollar Tree 
  
  DLTR 
  is one national chain dealing with supply shortages. Retail Dive reported that the retailer “previously assumed that ocean carriers would fulfill 85% of their contractual commitments — already a problematic situation — along with higher rates. Now the company projects that its regular carriers will fulfill just 60% to 65% of their commitments.” While it is looking at other solutions, the increased costs of getting goods shipped is especially troubling for a chain that is so focused on low price points.  On its most recent analysts’ quarterly call Macy’s 
  
  M 
  reported its inventory level had dropped 14.5%, partially by plan but also due to issues getting goods. CFO Adrian Mitchell noted that while the company has been able to find enough goods so far, “reduced supply is ultimately detrimental, offering [customers] a more limited selection.” In a CNN report, Bob Biesterfeld, CEO of the large global logistics company C.H. Robinson, said “The pressures on global supply chains have not eased and we do not expect them to anytime soon.” On the other side of the ledger such large national retailers as Home Depot 
  
  HD 
 , Lowe’s, Target 
  
  TGT 
  and Williams Sonoma 
  
  WSM 
 , while acknowledging the supply chain challenges have said so far they are getting enough goods for their operations.  Ross Stores 
  
  ROST 
 , in comments that reflect those made by other off-price operations, also mentioned product shortage issues in its most recent quarterly conversations but said it is dealing with them successfully. “What’s happening is that merchandise deliveries are sliding,” CEO Barbara Rentler said. “So, it could slide two weeks, 30 days. They are sliding, and so what the merchants are really doing is they are constantly flexing based on what they are seeing in the market, the availability and they’re chasing into classifications that they need. It’s a little bit of a moving target,” she said.  “But overall, there is plenty of supply.” A tale of two industries indeed.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2021/09/07/retail-haves-and-have-nots-why-the-supply-chain-is-so-uneven/,Retail Haves And Have-Nots: Why The Supply Chain Is So Uneven
"Jasprit Bumrah inspired India to an epic Test victory. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) News flash, Shane Warne is one of the best ever cricketers. Arguably even the greatest considering his impact on leg-spin bowling and the countless times he conjured the impossible for the almighty Australia teams of the 1990s and 2000s. But, like many retired great athletes, Warne’s legendary deeds on-field started fading over time and - for particularly newer fans - his post-career media shtick started to take hold.  It’s a bit like Charles Barkley, who younger NBA fans know as a wisecracking, not always so informed analyst derided for not winning a ring. It can be easy to forget that he was a basketball unicorn who legit went toe-to-toe against an absolutely prime Michael Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals.  These days, Warne’s penchant for blokey, macho commentary - particularly alongside his former teammates in the ex-Channel Nine broadcast - is often mocked but there are times when his words carry much gravitas.  Early in the final session of a gripping fifth day of the fourth Test at the Oval, Warne was discussing the best proponents of Yorkers he had seen. He rattled off the usual suspects - Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram and Brett Lee - to name a few.  Shane Warne was fulll of praise for Jasprit Bumrah. (Photo by Kelly Defina - CA/Cricket Australia ... [+] via Getty Images) But the Australian great then stated that Jasprit Bumrah was as good as any of them while India’s bowling talisman tried to lead his side to a brilliant comeback victory and series lead.  At this stage of the Test, all four results were possible in the type of juncture that makes the long format so compelling. A target of 368 looked mighty difficult for England’s meek batting order so reliant on captain Joe Root, who has been in the form of his life and almost single-handedly willed his team back into the series.  But the home team had made a strong start through openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed fuelling a sell-out crowd to replicate somewhat the carnival atmosphere of 16 years ago when England regained the Ashes.  The game was ominously poised at lunch with England two wickets down but Root importantly was at the crease and the home faithful willed them on. Would favored India buckle under the pressure and somehow find themselves unable to win the series outright against a middling England Test team?  Of course not. Made in captain Virat Kohli’s unwavering image, a confident India grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck in a defining second session where Bumrah justified Warne’s earlier glowing endorsement.  He bowled danger man Jonny Bairstow with a searing, dipping Yorker that probably no batsman could have kept out. Bumrah moments earlier had taken the pivotal wicket of Ollie Pope, England’s top-scorer in the first innings, with a masterful in-swinger that knocked over the perplexed No.5.  India's Jasprit Bumrah starred on day 5. (Photo by Adam Davy/PA Images via Getty Images) It was Bumrah’s 100th Test wicket and a milestone in the career of a quick who might be the best paceman in the world. The 27-year-old’s already in the Mt Rushmore of India’s quicks.  Fairly short for a quick – standing just 5’10” – Bumrah has an unorthodox, whippy stiff-arm action where he can generate great speeds of around 90mph. His unusual action makes him awkward to face but he has all the tricks.  Like the great Malcolm Marshall, the West Indian quick of the 1980s rated as arguably the most complete bowler ever, Bumrah can swing the ball both ways making it almost impossible to ever feel comfortable when facing him.  Just two years ago, Bumrah’s promising career was seemingly at the crossroads due to a stress fracture in his back - an injury that has derailed many fast bowlers over the years. But thanks to the marvels of modern science and his own indefatigable work rate, Bumrah has bounced back better than ever.  But he’s not doing it alone. India have a talented arsenal of quicks which is the backbone of their team and spurred them to consistently win away from home in traditionally tough conditions.  Shardul Thakur took vital wickets including stubborn opener Burns and then the big scalp of Root to effectively seal India’s stunning comeback victory having trailed on the first innings by 99 runs.  Thakur has a knack of taking key wickets, while speedster Umesh Yadav finished it off by wiping out England’s tail to give India a stranglehold of the blockbuster five-Test series.  It was another gritty victory for India, who can invoke a lot of cynicism given their powerful board’s heft but this is a team who are on a mission to become a great Test nation in the mould of the ‘80s West Indies and Steve Waugh’s Australia.  You have to admire the vision.  Kohli’s struggles with the bat continues, he inexplicably can’t register a ton, but he had one of his finest captaincy days. He made all the right moves and appeared to have the Midas touch as India never panicked during nerve-jangling stretches.  Virat Kohli was jubilant with India's victory. (Photo by GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images) India now can’t lose the series but will be eyeing a decisive 3-1 scoreline which will sit nicely alongside their 2-1 triumph earlier this year in Australia.  Few could have envisioned that tough task doable previously for India, who have long struggled in foreign conditions. But this is a formidable line-up with no real weakness. It’s a well-rounded, hardened team. Undoubtedly India’s best surpassing the batting-heavy Sourav Ganguly team of the mid-2000s. They will need to be ruthless in the finale - a characteristic which separated those all-time West Indies and Australia teams - but you just know they have a bucketload of motivation.  This is a chance for immortality, after all.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlavalette/2021/09/07/led-by-jasprit-bumrahs-brilliance-india-register-famous-test-cricket-win-over-england/,"Led By Jasprit Bumrah’s Brilliance, India Register Famous Test Cricket Win Over England"
"Charlotte Flair vs. Nia Jax WWE Raw advertised Nia Jax vs. Charlotte Flair for the Raw Women’s Championship just one week after their disastrous match on Raw. Raw also advertised Drew McIntyre vs. Sheamus in addition to Tag Team Turmoil with the top tag teams vying to become next in line to become the No. 1 Contenders.  Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.907 million viewers.        This crowd did not seem on board with any of Riddle’s suggestions, even ironically.  I assumed the Lucha House Party had been released and was pleasantly surprised to learn that they’re still with the company.  From the jump, this broadcast of WWE Raw pushed the fact that this would be a tag team-heavy show. I’m very interested to see the impact this has on the ratings. It’s as if WWE wanted to book so many tag team matches, you’d forget about the classic from AEW All Out last night.  The New Day continued its nWo cosplaying as Kofi Kingston dressed as Kevin Nash. I don’t like the odds of the duo taking their cosplaying to the next level by adding Hulk Hogan.  The New Day and Viking Raiders had immediate chemistry despite facing each other rarely, if ever, in the past.  Both Xavier Woods and Lince Dorado were confused as to who was supposed to sell a high cross. Xavier Woods sold it like he had just taken the move, and Dorado sold his high cross as if Xavier Woods blocked it.  Mace and T-Bar got more TV time in the first hour of Raw than they did the past several weeks combined. This match was put on hold due to the attack from Mace and T-Bar.   The fact that Drew McIntyre is in a math to become No. 1 Contender for the United States Championship solidifies him as Midcard McIntyre until further notice.  Drew McIntyre and Sheamus are incapable of having a bad match.  After yet another loss, Drew McIntyre is either turning heel or on his way to SmackDown.  Nikki A.S.H. and Rhea Ripley are officially named Super Brutality. This latest strange bedfellow team features a reluctant Rhea Ripley and an overly enthusiastic Nikki Cross.  Tamina kicked Rhea Ripley right in the face with an otherwise impressive super kick. Moments later, Rhea Ripley appeared to issue a receipt in the form of a running dropkick to the face.  As long as Nikki Cross and Rhea Ripley aren’t chasing the Raw Women’s Championship, they could potentially get over as a tag team, especially with titles.  Karrion Kross looked out-of-place surrounded by the playful “MoistTV” set.  It’s good that Karrion Kross was made to look like such a tough guy in this segment. At least WWE remains dedicated to building up this character, for better or worse.  John Morrison’s gimmick is to only face the biggest and baddest WWE Superstars. A match against Bobby Lashley is almost inevitable at this point.  John Morrison bumped fantastically for Kross.  Regardless of how bad their match was last week, and perhaps because of it, I was far more interested in this Charlotte vs. Nia Jax match than I was anything else on Raw. WWE was pretty much promoting this match by saying ""What if they shoot on each other again?!"" Of course, Charlotte and Nia Jax begun this match by mimicking an actual brawl.  Charlotte Flair continuously performed the “suck it” gesture, and cameras quickly zoomed in to hide it.  Alexa’s portion of this promo exchange seemed pre-recorded.  Alexa Bliss, who was granted a world title shot “because she wanted one,” got a very good reaction when she shoed up in the arena.  It was sad to see Shelton Benjamin and Cedric Alexander relegated to the 24/7 division.  Drake Maverick made his return to the roster in the main segment, less than one week after losing alongside Grayson Waller.  “Doudrop-alution” is one of the worst play-on words I’ve ever heard.  I liked how WWE intertwined The New Day’s injury from earlier with Mansoor and Ali’s differences about being ethical in the ring.  Kofi Kingston is quietly becoming the king of the Gauntlet Match.  With one chop, Omos cut off a Kofi Kingston hot tag before it even got started.  MVP was super over in his hometown of Miami, Fla., which still popped for him when he immediately tagged out. These fans are more into a basic test of strength between Bobby Lashley and Omos than they were anything else in this show and I love to see it.  Tag Team Turmoil Results: The New Day def.

"Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, returns against Jenson Brooksby, of the United States, during the fourth ... [+] round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 6, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Jenson Brooksby was the last American man or woman standing at the U.S. Open — and the latest obstacle to Novak Djokovic’s pursuit of history. The 6-foot-4 20-year-old from Sacramento and onetime Baylor Bear pushed Djokovic to the limit, shocking him in a quick first set, before the world No. 1 reestablished control en route to a 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, victory in the fourth round in an electric Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic won his 25th straight Grand Slam match in 2021, and improved to 11-0 against Americans in New York. Djokovic has won eight of those 25 matches this season after dropping the first set. The Serb now stands three victories from becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the calendar Grand Slam. On Wednesday in the quarterfinals, Djokovic will face Italian No. 6 seed Matteo Berrettini, whom Djokovic beat in the Wimbledon final for his record-tying 20th major title. “Brooksby is a very young, very talented player,” Djokovic told Brad Gilbert on court. “I told him at the net that the future is ahead of him, definitely. He’s a great player.” Jenson Brooksby, of the United States, reacts during his match against Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, ... [+] during the fourth round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 6, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Brooksby entered the match ranked No. 99 in the world, with a 12-6 record in 2021, but was just 4-3 in majors. Yet by reaching the fourth round, he became the youngest American man to do so since Andy Roddick in 2002. His ranking is certain to jump dramatically after the Open. With his variety of slices and drop shots from the baseline and tactical instincts, Brooksby shocked Djokovic by jumping out to a quick 3-0 lead and took the first set in half an hour. The crowd quickly adopted Brooksby as their own and cheered him raucously.  “He has top-10 talent written all over him,” ESPN’s John McEnroe said on air. The Serb struggled with his forehand and sprayed errors all over the court in the first set. It was the third time in four matches that Djokovic has dropped the first set, so he was in familiar territory.  “It wasn’t a great start for me,” Djokovic said. “Jenson had a clear game plan, he was executing all the shots very efficiently. And I was really on my back foot. I didn’t have the rhythm and made a lot of errors. He was reading the play very well for about a set and a half. “I think the momentum was changed probably mid-way through the second set...After that I started hitting more cleanly and through the court.” After Djokovic rebounded to capture the second set, he left the court to change his clothes while Brooksby called for the trainer and ended up taking a tablet of some sort. Djokovic then appeared to ask for one, too. Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, returns against Jenson Brooksby, of the United States, during the fourth ... [+] round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 6, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) The serve is the only thing that Brooksby does not do at an elite level. Roddick, known for his booming serves that helped lead to the 2003 U.S. Open title, texted ESPN’s Brad Gilbert during the match to say he could fix Brooksby’s serve in “four days.” “He’s definitely going to be a Top 10 player, the big if is he can develop a serve,” Gilbert said on air.  Brooksby missed 14 months coming into 2021 due to arm and toe injuries and did not play a single college match at Baylor after enrolling. He opted to turn pro last December when he was ranked No. 307 in the world. Baylor ended up losing in the NCAA final without him. Brooksby fought gamely as the match wore on, but Djokovic, as he inevitably does, took control.  When Djokovic finally won, the last American had been eliminated from the tournament. Earlier Monday, Shelby Rogers, who upset world No. 1 Ash Barty on Saturday, was routed by 18-year-old Brit Emma Raducanu, 6-2, 6-1. Later, 7-footer Reilly Opelka lost in four sets to South African Lloyd Harris, who will face No. 4 Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals. The winner of that match will meet the Djokovic/Berrettini winner in the semis. Matteo Berrettini, of Italy, waves to the crowd after defeating Oscar Otte, of Germany, in the ... [+] fourth round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 6, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Those who have followed Brooksby believe he will eventually contend for majors. “You know, we have I think 14 or 15 Americans in the top 100, so we've got a huge group of guys there,” Opelka said. “We just don't have the world beaters. I don't think we will have a [Pete] Sampras, [Andre] Agassi era of just dominance like that again. It's rare for any country. Russia is kind of the closest thing to it now. But I think Brooksby is our best, Brooksby and [Sebastian] Korda are our best top candidates for maybe winning a slam of the young guys.” Said Djokovic: ""He's only 20, he has a bright future ahead of him. America has a bright future in tennis, for sure."" While Brooksby’s chance to contend for majors may not come for some time, Djokovic is inching closer to history. He next faces Berrettini, a 2019 semifinalst at the Open against whom Djokovic is 3-0.

"Toronto Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. watches his home run against the New York Yankees during ... [+] the first inning of a baseball game on Monday, Sept. 6, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) With one flick of the wrist, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. reached for a full-count curveball over the outer edge of the plate. Its destination was a few rows back in the right field seats at Yankee Stadium and for the 40th time this year, Guerrero trotted around the bases. It was a history-making trot as well. When Guerrero Jr. hit his latest homer, those in attendance saw him join his father Vladimir Sr. as the second father-son duo to produce at least one 40-homer season.  “I have front row seats to watch this whole season,” manager Charlie Montoyo said. “What he’s done, that’s not easy to do. This guy he’s going to be one of the best players in baseball. Actually he already is and it’s been fun to watch somebody that young be that good at the plate.” Montoyo also had a close up of Vladimir Sr. in 1996 when the pair were teammates for the Double-A Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League 
  
  EML 
 . While Montoyo was in his last season as a player, the elder Guerrero was a 20-year-old on the way to a Hall of Fame career and his stop in Harrisburg featured a .360 average, 19 homers and 78 RBIs in 118 games. It was among the 16 times Guerrero Sr. hit at least .300 in a professional season. “I’ve been there,” Montoyo told a reporter in 1996 about what was ahead of Guerrero Sr.. “He has to keep doing what he’s doing, letting his bat do the talking. At age 22, it is hard not to imagine Guerrero producing several more 40 seasons and letting his bat do the talking with many, many, loud sounds. In the meantime, the Guerrero family joined Cecil and Prince Fielder as the second father-son duo to homer 40 times in a season. “That’s amazing,” Toronto’s Marcus Semien said. “I knew when we took BP, it was a good day to hit to right field. He didn’t hit on the field but I mentioned that to him. He’s so good he did it in his first at-bat. It’s something special. There’s a long way to go this month and he looks like he’s getting really hot and that’s something we’re going to need.” By comparison, Cecil Fielder’s first 40-homer season was in his age 26-season when he hit 51 for the Detroit Tigers following a one-year stint in Japan that came after he hit .243 and 46 homers in four seasons for the Blue Jays. Cecil Fielder followed it up with 44 more homers in 1991 and then finished with four more seasons of at least 30 homers. His son Prince Fielder made it 40 homers in his age 23 season when he slugged 50 in 2007 for Milwaukee and produced 46 homers in 2009 en route to 319 for his 12-year career. Guerrero Sr. totaled 449 and reached the 40-homer plateau twice when his son was a toddler. In 1999, Guerrero hit 42 homers and reached the mark in the penultimate game of the season at Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium off Paul Byrd.  The next season, Guerrero Sr. got 44 homers, reaching the mark on Sept. 18, 2000 in an otherwise inconsequential game against the Miami Marlins. Twenty-one years later, he is the proud Hall of Fame father of a son, who not only hits for power for average and does it fairly consistent for a lineup that might wind up being the biggest obstacle to the Yankees’ quest for getting the home game in the wild card or even getting to the play-in game. “It seems like Vladdy’s been steady the whole time,” Semien said. “He takes his singles but he will take you deep too. He’s been so consistent this whole entire year. Even when people say he’s in a slump, he’s still probably hitting over .250 which is still good. So, he’s so talented and he knows his swing too. So, it’s scary I think.” And by the way, Guerrero’s historic drive came on a three-hit day that gave him a .414 average in a 14-game hitting streak and a .321 average in a season where his average has been over .300 following 134 of the 135 games he has appeared in. “It’s not easy to do at that age but more impressive to me is the singles he’s getting to the opposite field,” Montoyo said. “He’s not looking for home runs and that’s why he has a good hitting streak.” The differences in the Blue Jays and Yankees can be seen in batting average even though it is a number not valued by some segments in baseball.  Toronto’s first seven hitters each ended Monday hitting .260 or higher, giving the Blue Jays a .264 team average. The Yankees ended their seventh loss in nine games since their 13-game run to the top of the wild card spot with a .236 average and nobody in their starting lineup ended the day with an average higher than .291.  Guerrero also did what Joey Gallo could not do. Gallo did not come close to homering or getting a hit with a four strikeouts (three looking) and is down to .130 with 61 of his 123 at-bats for the Yankees ending in strikeouts. And while Guerrero will not homer in each game (we think), the Blue Jays showed a lineup capable of coming through more often than not as opposed to the Yankees, who even during their longest run since Sept. 1961 were not great in that area. “We’re coming through with runners on more,” Semien said. “That’s something we’re going to need to do down the stretch,” he said. “We’re starting to get a feel for how teams are attacking us, especially with runners in scoring position.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryfleisher/2021/09/06/vladimir-guerrero-jrs-historic-season-makes-toronto-blue-jays-serious-threat-for-the-new-york-yankees/,Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s Historic Season Makes Toronto Blue Jays Serious Threat For New York Yankees
"Virginia officials plan to remove a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that has towered 60 feet above the state capital of Richmond for over a century on Wednesday, ending months of legal acrimony, the latest Confederate monument to face removal. People gather around at the Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia on June 4, ... [+] 2020. Crews will remove the 21-foot-tall bronze statue of Lee on horseback from its pedestal in Richmond on Wednesday, and store it in a state-owned facility “until a decision is made as to its disposition,” state officials said in a statement Monday. The statue’s 40-foot granite pedestal will remain onsite, in the middle of a grassy rotary on Richmond’s Monument Avenue, but crews will remove plaques affixed to its base. “This is an important step in showing who we are and what we value as a Commonwealth,” Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said in a statement. The Lee statue was placed in Richmond — which served as the Confederacy’s capital city — in 1890, preceding a nationwide surge of Confederate monument-building in the early 20th century, especially in states gripped by overt racial segregation. Locals have called for the statue’s removal for years, and Northam pushed to take down the monument in June 2020, amid a wave of racial justice protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Northam was hit by a pair of lawsuits from plaintiffs who argued a property deed and state law from the 19th century barred the governor from removing the statue, but the state Supreme Court affirmed Northam’s power to take down the monument last week, allowing him to move forward with the removal. State and local governments have pushed for years to remove Confederate statues, which many critics have castigated as celebrations of white supremacy. This process sped up last year. Charleston removed a statue of pro-slavery South Carolina Sen. John C. Calhoun in June 2020, Richmond removed statues of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson and several of his contemporaries last summer, and Tennessee removed a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest from its state capitol six weeks ago. Plus, Charlottesville, Virginia, removed statues of Lee and Jackson in mid-July, four years after an initial proposal to take down the Lee statue fueled a violent white nationalist rally in the city.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/06/virginia-will-take-down-massive-statue-of-robert-e-lee-this-week/,Virginia Will Take Down Massive Statue Of Robert E.

"The facade and logo of the New York Times newspaper is pictured in New York City. Ben Shapiro’s conservative news website The Daily Wire has trounced every other publisher on Facebook in 2021, in terms of engagement metrics such as likes and comments that legacy news sites don’t come anywhere close to matching. TV ratings for August, meanwhile, show Fox News once again beating its cable network rivals like CNN. And Substack is proving a durable publishing platform for right-leaning media figures like Glenn Greenwald, who no longer have to find a way to operate within the strictures of a mainstream media ecosystem. None of this, of course, is happening in a vacuum. New data from the Pew Research Center shows that trust in the mainstream media among Republicans continues to essentially fall off a cliff. And it’s not as though those disaffected news consumers don’t have anywhere to turn, in search of alternatives that are more palatable to them.  Against the backdrop of having more news and opinion than ever now presented through an avowedly partisan lens, the results of the new Pew Research Center survey show, among other things:   The partisan spread between these two groups (35% among Republicans, compared to 78% among Democrats who say they trust the national news) is the largest it’s been since the Pew researchers have asked this question over the last five years. The gap gets even wider when the partisan dial is turned up even more. Among liberal Democrats compared to the most conservative Republicans? No surprise, even fewer of the latter say they have faith in the national news media (just 30%) compared to 83% for the former. “Overall,” according to Pew, “about six-in-ten U.S. adults (58%) say they have at least some trust in the information that comes from national news organizations. While still a majority, this is the smallest share over the past five years this question was asked. “When it was last asked in late 2019, 65% expressed at least some trust. And far fewer (12%) express that they have ‘a lot’ of trust in the information that comes from national news organizations.” By way of putting all this into some historical context: This phenomenon can also be weighed against the backdrop of a specific news narrative that will be increasingly prevalent in the coming days. Specifically, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Already, there’s been a predictability to the news coverage timed to this sobering milestone moment. Which marks two decades having passed since hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Center as well as the Pentagon, killing almost 3,000 Americans that day. It cannot go unmentioned, for example, that the abrupt and chaotic departure of the US from Afghanistan in recent days marks a dramatic turnaround from the military response that was launched 20 years ago. Nor should the controversial surveillance apparatus that was stood up in the wake of 9/11 be forgotten. The major streamers, like Netflix and Apple TV+, have released slickly packaged and compelling deep dives into that tragic day in the US and the events surrounding it. Like Netflix’s Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror — a 5-episode limited series that not only unpacks the events of the day itself but also probes world events that set the stage for it, as well as the aftermath. The results of the Pew survey, meanwhile, suggest a profound transformation in the US of today, compared to the one that existed on 9/11. Consider, for example, that there have been multiple days in the US this year when the country has seen a level of death from COVID-19 equivalent to the loss of life on 9/11. And yet, the country remains fractured and somewhat regional in its response to the pandemic, with nowhere near the national unity on display in the immediate wake of 9/11. There is pervasive mistrust of authority figures, such as White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci. And a not insignificant slice of the country regards agencies like the CDC as craven affiliates of a political operation, rather than a source of experts dispensing sound and scientific advice. And, of course, trust in the national mainstream media is nowhere near what it once was. The part of this story about trust that the mainstream media almost never grapples with, however, is its own culpability herein. Let’s take Rolling Stone magazine’s story in recent days about supposed ivermectin overdoses causing chaos in a hospital as just one example.  In the lead-up to its publication, this anti-parasitic drug has been championed in right wing circles, presumably as a way to obviate the need for a coronavirus vaccine. Even though the FDA and CDC have urged Americans that ivermectin is not an acceptable treatment for COVID-19. “People are purchasing various highly concentrated animal ivermectin drug formulations such as ‘pour-on,’ injectable, paste and ‘drench’ that are intended for horses, cattle and sheep, and taking these drugs has made some people very sick,"" the FDA warned in a letter to veterinarians and other recipients. Nevertheless, it has champions such as comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan, who disclosed his own positive case of COVID-19 a few days ago. In a social media post to his followers, he added that he’d been given a mix of drugs to fight off the virus, including ivermectin. And that he now feels much better. This brings us to the Rolling Stone story. On Friday, the magazine ran a story that went viral about Oklahoma hospitals being overwhelmed with ivermectin overdose cases. And that the volume of patients was so bad, it was causing other patients to get backed up in their own wait for treatment. The story relied on testimony from Dr. Jason McElyea, who’d given some comments to a local news station. Other mainstream outlets that picked up this story included Newsweek, The Guardian and Insider. Rolling Stone, however, has since attached an “update” to the story that basically undercuts the whole thing — and has given conservatives the opportunity to have a field day with what it sees as another example of media bias. The update reads, in part: “One hospital has denied Dr. Jason McElyea’s claim that ivermectin overdoses are causing emergency room backlogs and delays in medical care in rural Oklahoma, and Rolling Stone has been unable to independently verify any such cases as of the time of this update ... Following widespread publication of his statements, one hospital that the doctor’s group serves, NHS Sequoyah, said its ER has not treated any ivermectin overdoses and that it has not had to turn away anyone seeking care.” One bad story, it should go without saying, doesn’t implicate the entirety of the mainstream media. But it’s a virtual certainty that examples like this one, over and over again, will keep sending news consumers fleeing for alternative information channels, complaining all the while of bias and untrustworthiness in the mainstream media. With the only thing likely to change in any meaningful way is that this problem will just keep getting worse.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2021/09/06/republicans-are-abandoning-the-national-mainstream-media-in-droves-because-they-dont-trust-it/,Republicans Are Abandoning The National Mainstream Media In Droves
"Apple Music acquires Primephonic (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Apple Music announced its acquisition of Primephonic, the acclaimed classical music streaming service that offers an outstanding listening experience with search and browse functionality optimized for classical, premium-quality audio, handpicked expert recommendations, and extensive contextual details on repertoire and recordings. With the addition of Primephonic, Apple Music subscribers will get a significantly improved classical music experience beginning with Primephonic playlists and exclusive audio content. In the coming months, Apple Music Classical fans will get “a dedicated experience with the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” “We love and have a deep respect for classical music, and Primephonic has become a fan favorite for classical enthusiasts,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Together, we’re bringing great new classical features to Apple Music, and in the near future, we’ll deliver a dedicated classical experience that will truly be the best in the world.” “Bringing the best of Primephonic to Apple Music subscribers is a tremendous development for the classical music industry,” said Thomas Steffens, Primephonic’s co-founder and CEO. “Artists love the Primephonic service and what we’ve done in classical, and now we have the ability to join with Apple to deliver the absolute best experience to millions of listeners. We get to bring classical music to the mainstream and connect a new generation of musicians with the next generation of audience.” “Primephonic was founded to ensure that classical music will stay relevant for future generations,” said Gordon P. Getty, a major shareholder of Primephonic. “Primephonic and Apple together can realize that mission and take classical to a worldwide audience.” Primephonic will no longer be available for new subscribers and will be taken offline entirely on September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more added features. In the meantime, “current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.” Consistent with their business plan, Apple buys dozens of companies every year which often goes under the radar, CNBC reports. The trendsetting company also acquires engineers with expertise in particular areas or to add key technology to an ongoing initiative. To expand its offerings, some of the company’s largest acquisitions have been in the music space. In 2014, Apple bought streaming music service and headphone maker Beats for $3 billion in 2014, and music-identification service Shazam for a price reportedly around $400 million in 2017. Also in 2018, it quietly bought Platoon, a service for helping users discover artists, although the purchase amount was not disclosed.  In a letter posted Monday to its website, Primephonic said that the acquisition will help it serve more classical music listeners worldwide. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company said. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashadgrove/2021/09/06/apple-announces-its-acquisition-of-primephonic-a-classical-music-streaming-service/,"Apple Announces Its Acquisition Of Primephonic, A Classical Music Streaming Service"
"Airlines are struggling to gain traction on the return of business travel. As companies push back ... [+] return to office requirements, and governments continue to push rules that limit gathering, airlines face a bleak second half of 2021 and can't be too optimistic about 2022.  Summer 2021 proved to be good for U.S. airlines in terms of volume, though incentive pricing meant that revenue wasn't quite as robust. In the fall, traditionally families don't travel much and businesses hit the road again. While business volumes are smaller than leisure, the higher fares paid by business travelers normally makes fall a profitable season for the largest U.S. airlines that carry most corporate road warriors.  Fall 2021 does not look so bright, however, consistent with the apprehensions about rebounding pandemic risks and continually changing government policies related to travel and grouping in general. As a result, this fall is likely to be another money-losing season for the largest U.S. airlines as they are offering a lot of seats for sale to passengers who just aren’t that likely to show up. Pre-pandemic, the summer family vacation season would end in mid to late August and was replaced with a fairly robust business bump. With kids back in school, companies would send people out to generate new business, inspect facilities, meet with clients, and more. Also, fall is time for many trade shows and conventions and this would generate almost 20% of all business travel. Big convention cities like Orlando, Las Vegas, Chicago and more would benefit from these events, as the hotels and local restaurants could attest. When summer 2021 showed such leisure strength, and vaccine roll-outs had businesses estimating returns to office for most employees in September, there was reason to be optimistic that this traditional fall business bump could happen. Instead of a business bump, businesses are retrenching in terms of air travel. The fast infection rates by the Delta variant have caused companies to push back return to office plans, and when the New York Auto Show went virtual this sent shock waves through the convention industry. Further, Bloomberg published survey results showing the largest companies in the U.S. are expecting to cut back on business travel indefinitely. This fall, with few leisure customers and businesses cutting back, it could mean that airlines are in a situation with too many seats chasing too few customers. Book a flight for a mid-week trip between any two big cities, and you likely will surprised at the low fares you will find. Airlines will gasp until Thanksgiving to see if the boom in summer leisure travel continues with families wanting to be together for that holiday.  Longer-haul, international travel is more complicated and continues to be subject to ever-changing government rules. Some countries let you in if you’re vaccinated, some don’t; some require a quarantine, some don’t. British Airways, whose primary business is carrying people long distances to and from London, is starting a low-cost airline at London’s Gatwick airport because they don’t know what else to do with all of their airplanes. The largest U.S. airlines are using wide-body equipment that normally flies across an ocean to fly to places like Las Vegas, Miami, and Hawaii. The fall holds no hope for the return of long-haul international travel, and with pressure on the domestic revenues as well this means a bleak third quarter. Airlines have said as much, with several airline and multiple industry analysts warning of weak results for the back half of the year. The low-cost airline industry continues to be aggressive and remains the best positioned among U.S. airlines for multiple reasons. These airlines live all year on leisure traffic, as they typically don’t offer the schedule or service to attract higher-paying business customers. When businesses don’t travel, America, Delta, Southwest, and United feel it but airlines like Alaska, JetBlue, and Spirit don’t. The newest U.S. airlines, Avelo and Breeze, aren’t betting on business travel either. The low cost of production for these airlines allows them to be profitable at lower average fares, meaning that they can make money on the travel that largest U.S. airlines use only for fill. Around the world, this is proving true as the airlines with the traditionally largest business travel revenue seem the most fragile. In June, airlines and those who track the financial health of the industry were bullish about 2022. With strong leisure demand showing and businesses all talking about getting back to normal, there was reason to be optimistic. The last few months have started to show that a new reality is setting in, one that suggests that business traffic will never be the same and some aspects of business travel will never return. This has significant implications for the U.S. airlines, especially the largest ones. This is spurring new discussion of alternative seating to make more, denser cabins feel more comfortable, and putting more emphasis on where people are likely to travel for leisure rather than for business. High-frequency among large cities many be reduced somewhat in favor of larger average aircraft flying less often. Importantly, 2022 is uncertain in term of industry profitability as carriers work through these structural issues. Rather than emerging in 2022, the U.S. airline industry is likely to continue to muddle through until the country and the world better understand the risks and realities of living with this virus.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/benbaldanza/2021/09/06/why-fall-airline-business-travel-wont-mimic-the-busy-leisure-summer/,Why Fall Airline Business Travel Won’t Mimic The Busy Leisure Summer
"Hybrid work models vary widely.  Hybrid work is trending, and it seems almost every organization that can, is planning to offer some kind of hybrid working arrangement for the majority of its employees. Of course, there are some types of businesses or jobs for which hybrid just isn’t an option. But many—including those who never would have imagined it before the pandemic—are now moving in the direction of hybrid.  There are plenty of good reasons to implement hybrid work: Organizations want to offer more flexibility to employees, and they want to support work-life. For many employees, the opportunity to avoid the commute or their button pants offer efficiency, convenience and comfort. Companies also recognize the reality of the talent revolution in which large proportions of people report they plan to leave their current employer—39% according to one study—if their employer doesn’t offer an option for remote work.  But companies cannot just decide to implement hybrid work without a lot of planning and strategic thinking—or they risk inefficiencies, inequity and the deterioration of their culture. In fact, a pitfall in implementing hybrid work is to over-simplify, or to underappreciate the depth of thinking that must be part of the planning.  Most companies want to know what others are doing. The request for “benchmark” information is often code for, “We really don’t know what to do. What can we learn (copy) from others?” The challenge is that few companies have fully implemented hybrid, and many are pressing the pause button on bringing people back—at least until the Delta variant is under better control. But we do know how some companies are choosing to implement hybrid work, and these approaches can provide breadcrumbs for those who come after.  As companies are implementing hybrid work, they will be wise to stay out of the debates about whether working remote or in the office has merit. Much of the popular press has turned the hybrid conversation into a debate about which is superior. In truth, both modes of work have benefits as well as drawbacks for employees and employers. And the true advantage of hybrid is the extent to which it offers greater choice and flexibility and the opportunity to work in multiple places—whether in the office or away from it. Companies are taking many different approaches to hybrid work, from an all-back-to-the-office model to a work-away-from-the-office-forever model. Think of these on a continuum which features a range of rationale for the various solutions. Here are the details: Some companies are requiring workers to come back to the office full time. Even when they are delaying the return, they plan to bring people back except in cases where employees have a unique need to continue working from home.  Rationale: These companies tend to believe they cannot (continue to) serve customers effectively with people out of the office. They may also believe their work requires a more in-person model based on a high need for information security or a desire for in-person collaboration because it is integral to their ability to compete. One CEO who is in the “all-back” camp said, “Make no mistake about it, sending people home to work was a response to the pandemic. It wasn’t a choice we made because we thought it was the best strategy for our business or our future.” Mandating number of days and days of the week. Some companies are taking an approach where they are mandating the number of days people come back and which days people are in the office. A popular model is a three-two model, for example. In this case, companies are mandating people come back three days a week (usually Monday through Wednesday or Tuesday through Thursday) and giving people the option to work from home the other days of the week.  Rationale: Businesses which are taking this approach want to find a balance between giving people choice and also maintaining their culture and the synergies which arise from people working together. By structuring a three-two (or in some cases a two-three) approach, they are hoping to provide overall guidelines which create consistency and equity while providing more efficiency in terms of team members coming together in person. They reason that having structure about when people are in the office will reduce the burden for team members and leaders who would otherwise have to put more effort into coordinating connections.  Mandating number of days, but not days of the week. Another group of companies is mandating the number of days people must be in the office, but leaving it to team leaders to determine the days of the week. For example, they are mandating people must be in the office two, three or four days a week, but allowing team leaders to be the decision makers about exactly which days of the week.  Rationale: Companies taking this approach are seeking to bring people into the office for necessary collaboration and critical mass, but attempting to provide flexibility so team leaders can make decisions specific to their teams’ work and the unique needs of individual employees.  Mandating weeks per month. While most companies are planning based on weekly segments of time, some are considering monthly rhythms. In these cases, companies are mandating people must be in the office one or two weeks a month. As with the models above, in some cases they are pre-determining which weeks, and in other cases, they are leaving this decision making up to leaders.  Rationale: Their rationale is similar to the rationale above—the difference in the model is they are thinking of a monthly, rather than a weekly unit for decision making. Often, this works best when the business cycle is based on a monthly or a quarterly cycle of activity. A few companies are saying employees must come back some of the time, but leaving the specifics (ex. number of days, days of the week) up to leaders.  Rationale: They believe there is value in bringing people back to the office but want to provide plenty of discretion and control for leaders to decide how many days and which days of the week will work best for the specific work of the team.  A handful of companies are announcing their employees will not need to come back to the office at all. However, when you read the fine print of their polices, most of these are asking leaders to make decisions at the team level in cases where the work demands some in-person presence. Rationale: Companies taking this approach believe they can be just as effective and maintain their cultures when people are working at a distance. Many of these have strong (and long-standing) leadership development programs which equip leaders with skills to lead effectively from a distance and engage and motivate employees based on outcomes. Many of these companies also have well-established systems for managing performance that is outcome-based. Many of them are also in especially competitive markets where talent is at a premium. While many organizations are developing hybrid working models with an emphasis on where people work, a small number of companies are trying innovative approaches which prioritize when people work. Some are experimenting with the shift to a four-day work week. Some of these are paying people for 40 hours of work, and others are paying people for 32 hours of work. In either case, they are asking people to avoid working on Fridays, so everyone benefits from a longer breather each week.  Rationale: These companies are seeking to tip the balance toward plenty of support for work-life and ensure they keep strong talent. They are also seeking to experiment and try new models so they can grow, evolve and innovate to be on the cutting edge of their value equations for employees and for customers.  Keep in mind how you decide and the models you adopt will be critical to your work, but will also send a message about your culture, your respect for people and your values and priorities. Be sure you’re making decisions which are best for people and for the business and which are truly fair and also perceived as fair.  A pitfall is to focus so much on the details of your model that you miss the bigger picture of your culture. Remember the old saying, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”? Beware getting into a situation where “process is eating culture alive.” Focus on how you’ll implement hybrid work, but not to the extent you miss the bigger picture of your culture and the messages you’re sending to employees and to your customers and shareholders.  As you’re deciding on your approach, you’ll want to consider all kinds of variables:   In addition, you’ll need to balance individual needs with team and organizational needs and ensure you’re balancing choice and flexibility with firm expectations for performance. You’ll also want to implement approaches to measure and monitor your processes over time, not only so you can respond to changing circumstances, but also so you can continuously improve based on what you will surely learn as new patterns of behavior emerge.  In a macro sense, this will be the most significant reinvention of work in our lifetimes. It is a moment for all of us to deeply consider (and reconsider) the value our companies deliver and how we innovate and compete, as well as how we create the conditions for people to be happy, fulfilled and bring their best to their work. Finding the right balance won’t be easy, but it represents an opportunity for brilliant new solutions that serve people and organizations.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2021/09/06/which-hybrid-model-is-best-options-impacts-and-rationale-for-the-right-choice/,"Which Hybrid Model Is Best?

Williams, who rose to fame as Omar Little in the critically-acclaimed 2002-08 HBO crime drama The Wire, was found dead of a suspected heroin overdose in his Brooklyn penthouse on Monday afternoon, according to law-enforcement sources. Williams, 54, was discovered unconscious in the dining room of his Williamsburg residence with what appeared to be heroin on the kitchen table, sources said.  “It is with deep sorrow that the family announces the passing of Emmy nominated actor Michael Kenneth Williams,” said his long-time PR rep Marianna Shafran in a statement. “They ask for your privacy while grieving this unsurmountable loss.” Said HBO in a statement: “We are devastated to learn of the passing of Michael Kenneth Williams, a member of the HBO family for more than 20 years. While the world is aware of his immense talents as an artist, we knew Michael as a dear friend who was beloved by all who had the privilege to work with him. We send our deepest condolences to his family for this immeasurable loss.” Born November 22, 1966 in Flatbush, Brooklyn, Williams began his career as a backup dancer on a music tour for Kym Sims’ dance anthem Too Blind To See It, which led videos as a dancer and on tours with artists like George Michael and Madonna. Next he found work as a model and choreographed Crystal Waters’ single 100% Pure Love in 1994. Williams segued into acting as High Top opposite the late rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996 film Bullet. On television, he made the rounds as a guest star in scripted dramas like Third Watch, The Sopranos, Alias, and Boston Legal before landing his first regularly scheduled series role in aforementioned The Wire.

"The Wisdom Of Crowds by Joe Abercrombie “Death is a bored clerk, with too many orders to fill. There is no reckoning, no profound moment. It creeps up on us from behind, and snatches us away while we shit.” ~Bremer dan Gorst, from The Heroes The Wisdom of Crowds rounds out Joe Abercrombie’s Age of Madness trilogy and I have just six words for you before you pick up this book (and you should) on September 14th: Make of yer heart a stone. This, of course, is the sage advice that the hillwoman, Isern-i-Phail, gives to Rikke of the Long Eye, the Dogman’s daughter, who traded her powers of portent in The Trouble With Peace to stop her descent into madness.  It’s good advice, especially for fans of the series who know, all too well, how deadly these tales can be. Like all of Abercrombie’s First Law novels, The Wisdom of Crowds pulls very few punches. These are not happy stories with happy endings, though they are not without triumphs. I want very badly to spoil everything, to discuss it all at great length with other passionate readers of Abercrombie’s work, but I will not do that here. This review will be spoiler free (though I will touch on past events from previous books, obviously). Perhaps later I’ll write a second, spoiler-filled discussion so we can talk about the particulars. For now, we will speak in broader terms. The Age Of Madness trilogy begins with A Little Hatred, continues with ever more surprising and galling twists and turns in The Trouble With Peace, and reaches its raucous, bloody conclusion in The Wisdom of Crowds. (For those of you who could use a “previously on” recap of the past two books before diving into this one, Joe has you covered at his blog). Curiously, the novel shares the title with James Surowiecki’s non-fiction book of the same name. That book’s blurb reads: “In this fascinating book, New Yorker business columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea: Large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant—better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.” I haven’t read it, but I wonder if the choice in title on Abercrombie’s part is intentional—and purposefully ironic.  Recall, by the end of The Trouble With Peace events were set in motion with the revolutionary Breakers and Burners and the big “reveal” of the true Weaver? Well it’s not a spoiler to say that this plays a very big part in The Wisdom Of Crowds, and the wisdom of crowds is used here with more than a little sardonicism. Crowds—or mobs, if you will—are often short on wisdom and long on barbarism and savagery. Then again, it’s not as though the elites do a much better job. Abercrombie’s exploration of human nature is wonderfully cynical. His revolutionaries are corrupt and stupid and bloodthirsty, but then so are his nobles and his wizards and his business tycoons. They’re not all out for themselves, but those who aren’t will likely suffer for it. Once again we follow the misadventures of a handful of complex characters, most of whom are the First Law trilogy’s “next generation”—the sons and daughters of characters from the first trilogy and its subsequent stand-alone novels. The point of view chapters include: Savine dan Glokta, the daughter of torturer and tyrant Sand dan Glokta and Ardee West, though in The Trouble With Peace we learn she is actually the bastard daughter of the now-dead king Jezal dan Luthar, an awkward revelation given that she has been lover to Jezal’s natural born son, Orso. When that relationship is suddenly broken off, Savine finds herself pressed into an unlikely union with Leo dan Brock, the young Lord Governor of Angland. Orso dan Luther, the compassionate, clever prince-turned-king who has hidden behind a foppish mask his entire life, pretending not to care or to only care about beautiful women, drugs and other creature comforts. Like Savine, Orso is no fool, but unlike the savvy businesswoman, Orso is also a generous ruler who has no real lust for power. At the end of The Trouble With Peace he’s just barely put down the Young Lion’s rebellion with a little help from . . . Rikke, daughter of the Dogman whose alliance with Orso against her old friend and lover, Leo dan Brock, results in the overthrow of Stour Nightfall, King of the Northmen and son of Black Calder. Rikke doesn’t need to rely on her Long Eye anymore; she’s as clever as her father and she’s surrounded herself with reliable advisers like Isern-i-Phail and Caul Shivers. She even used Stour’s own lieutenant (and POV character) Jonas Clover against him—though no one would ever accuse Clover of being reliable, let alone loyal. Leo dan Brock is left in the lurch thanks to Rikke’s betrayal, and his ill-advised rebellion goes badly awry, leaving him as crippled as his wife Savine’s adoptive father—well, not quite as crippled, but then he’s not quite the man Sand dan Glokta is either. Leo is headstrong, arrogant, foolish and vain. He’s also a bigot and a bumpkin and deeply, deeply closeted. It’s interesting to root for the corrupt Aduan government against the Young Lion; then again, Orso is far more likable than the Anglander, and much less the fool. The other POV characters in these books are ex-soldier-turned-revolutionary-turned-bodyguard/strongman Gunnar Broad, a massive brute of a man with a soft heart and a penchant toward violence. Then there is Vick dan Teufel, daughter of Sepp dan Teufel who Glokta convicted on false charges way back in The Blade Itself. Vick now works for Glokta and his replacement, Pike—who we discover at the end of The Trouble With Peace is the Weaver himself, the man pulling all the strings of revolution. The fates of plenty of other characters dangle in the balance as revolution shakes the very foundation of Adua. Leo’s best friend and secret admirer, Jurand; the bloodthirsty revolutionary, Judge (and her surprising origin story); the brilliant swordsman, Bremer dan Gorst and his unfortunate voice; Bayaz’s assistant, Yoru Sulfur and his mismatched eyes; the writer, and former Nicomo Cosca biographer Spillion Sworbreck, whose office has been so useful for young lovers over the years.  Where will they each land when the chips have all fallen? There are so many twists and turns, dear readers, that you do not yet know of, that will bend the fates of each of these characters in surprising, at times shocking, ways before you turn the final page.  The fate of these and others, of Bayaz and his machinations, of the great bank Valint and Balk, of Adua itself and its lords and ladies and small folk, not to mention the North. This is a book about revolution and political upheaval, terrible betrayal and daring adventure. You won’t see the knife until it’s well-lodged in your back. So make of yer heart a stone, because once again Abercrombie is at the height of his game, a wordsmith and story-weaver of such absurd talent that each jolting wrinkle you encounter will at once surprise you and make you realize that you probably should have seen it coming miles away. That takes a certain kind of subtlety and craft that very few fantasy authors possess. Abercrombie is also economical. Every chapter counts. Every POV character has his or her part to play. Nothing extraneous bogs down their stories. Characters all act in ways that make perfect sense, even if they do things that surprise or horrify us. The Wisdom Of Crowds is the perfect—if slightly depressing—conclusion to an excellent trilogy that pushes this series into bold new territory, into an age of machines and innovation, of decadent industrialism and galling class divisions and inequality. At times it feels shockingly relevant to the current moment, though Abercrombie largely wrote this story prior to last year’s protests and chaos. In Abercrombie’s fiction, the shining hero on horseback may be the most wretched cretin of them all, while the dandy of a prince, despised by his own people, is the one person with real courage and decency. In Abercrombie’s fiction, the most masterful spy can miss what’s right in front of her nose and the most cunning warlord can be outwitted by a thin scrap of a girl. Honor is found in the unlikeliest of places, but greed and self-interest still carry the day. Here there are no good, wise old Gandalfs, and the hero is just as likely to be a gambling, lazy corporal as a knight in shining armor.  And the villain? Well, you’ll see.  You can pick up The Wisdom Of Crowds on Amazon.  If you’re new to these books, don’t start there. Go back and read The Blade Itself, the first book in The First Law trilogy. A Little Hatred is the first book in this trilogy, however, this being the third trilogy in the broader series. Every single one is excellent. It is, hands down, one of the best fantasy series I have ever read and if Abercrombie isn’t planning another entry, or trilogy, to follow the events of The Wisdom Of Crowds, I’m not sure what I’ll do with myself. Read them all over again, I suppose. You have to be realistic about these things. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook. You can support my work on Patreon and sign up for my newsletter on Substack.

NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes. Williams’ death was mourned by family and friends like actor Wendell Pierce, who acted opposite Williams on “The Wire.” On Monday, Pierce his friend an “immensely talented man” whose acting roles shone a light on “the human condition” of people “whose humanity is seldom elevated.”  Williams is best known for his breakout role as Omar Little, a witty Baltimore drug dealer with a strong moral code on HBO’s “The Wire,” which began filming in 2002. Little is considered by many to be one of the most compelling characters in television history. Williams also starred on the network’s “Boardwalk Empire” for five seasons as Chalky White, a Prohibition-era crime syndicate leader. He also acted in “When They See Us,” a drama centered on the Central Park Five, and “Bessie,” in which Williams played American blues singer Bessie Smith’s first husband opposite Queen Latifah.

"Brazilian soccer icon Pelé said on Instagram Monday he is recovering after undergoing surgery last Saturday to remove a tumor from his right colon, one week after he denied reports that he had fainted and said he would undergo routine exams.

(Photo by FRANCK FIFE / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images) Pelé’s doctors told CNN a suspicious lesion was found during one of the cardiovascular and laboratory tests, which Pelé said he was unable to undergo earlier because of the pandemic. Pelé is currently in the ICU at Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, and will be transferred to a regular room Tuesday, according to The Athletic. The 80-year-old soccer star said he was “feeling very well” Monday, echoing his sentiments from last week that he was in “very good health.” “Fortunately, I'm used to celebrating great victories alongside you,” Pelé said in the Instagram post. “I will face this match with a smile on my face, a lot of optimism and joy for living surrounded by the love of my family and friends.” Edson Arantes do Nascimento, also known as Pelé, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time as the only player in men’s soccer history to win three World Cups, according to The Athletic. He won with the Brazilian soccer team in 1958, 1962 and 1970, and is currently Brazil’s top scorer with 77 goals. The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) also named him “Player of the Century” back in 2000, alongside Argentine soccer player Diego Maradona. In 2012, Pelé had a failed hip replacement surgery, which left him using walkers and wheelchairs to get around. Last year, reports began to swirl that Pelé was experiencing health problems after his son said in an interview that Pelé “was pretty fragile in terms of his mobility... and that makes him suffer a kind of depression.” However, the soccer icon denied he was depressed, saying, “after everything I've done in sports, I'm fine.

"The United States and several European countries denounced Belarus’ human rights practices on Monday, after a court hit two opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko — who declared victory in a widely criticized election last year — with decade-long prison sentences. Maria Kalesnikava, an opposition leader, poses on August 3, 2020 in Minsk, Belarus. Maria Kalesnikava and Maxim Znak were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively, multiple news outlets and Belarusian groups reported. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Kalesnikava and Znak’s charges — which included leading an extremist group and conspiring to seize state power — “bogus” and their closed trials “politically motivated” and “shameful” in a statement Monday. The European Union also called the charges against Kalesnikava and Znak “unfounded,” and criticized the Belarusian government more broadly for reportedly jailing hundreds of Lukashenko critics and dissidents. U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the sentences “will only deepen the pariah status of the Lukashenko regime,” the German foreign ministry told the Associated Press and other outlets the sentences symbolize Belarus’ wider crackdown on political opposition, and Polish President Andrzej Duda criticized the decision on Twitter. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya — Lukashenko’s primary opponent in last year’s elections — called Kalesnikava and Znak innocent: “It's terror against Belarusians who dare to stand up to the regime,” Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus for Lithuania, said in a tweet. “Regrettably, these sentencings are further evidence of the regime’s total disregard for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Belarus,” Blinken wrote Monday. “Ms. Kalesnikava and Mr. Znak deserved a transparent judicial determination of the bogus charges levied against them, which they did not receive.” Last month, the United States imposed new sanctions against a Belarusian state-owned company, the country’s National Olympic Committee and several business executives and companies with close ties to Lukashenko. Canada and the United Kingdom also hit Belarus with sanctions on the same day, a coordinated effort the White House tied to the anniversary of Lukashenko’s contested August 2020 reelection. It’s unclear whether Western criticism will sway Lukashenko. The president — sometimes called “Europe’s last dictator” — has kept a tight grip on Belarus for 27 years, despite facing rounds of U.S. sanctions since 2006, when he won reelection in another race dogged by allegations of fraud. Lukashenko has also cultivated closer ties with Russia: Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Lukashenko on his contested reelection win, lent billions of dollars to Belarus and called the country Russia’s “closest ally.” A lawyer and a musician by trade, Znak and Kalesnikava both earned attention during the fallout from last summer's presidential election, which Lukashenko — who has led Belarus since 1994 — claimed to win by an 80% margin, a result many foreign and domestic critics argue was rigged. Kalesnikava backed Tsikhanouskaya’s campaign, and she and Znak were later members of the Coordination Council, an opposition group formed after the election, when Belarus was swept by widespread protests and brutal police crackdowns. Znak and Kalesnikava were arrested and jailed last year.  Belarusian authorities have drawn international scorn for their efforts to detain opposition figures. In May, authorities arrested a journalist and dissident off a Ryanair flight after a military jet forced the commercial plane to land in Belarus. President Joe Biden called the government’s actions “shameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press.” Lukashenko’s government claimed the plane was forced to land due to a bomb threat.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/06/us-slams-belarus-for-politically-motivated-imprisonment-of-lukashenko-foes/,U.S. Slams Belarus For ‘Politically Motivated’ Imprisonment Of Lukashenko Foes
"The total number of Covid-19 infections in the United States since the start of the pandemic surpassed 40 million on Monday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as a fourth wave fueled by the delta variant is pushing the hospital systems in many states to their breaking point.  More than 102,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 over Labor Day weekend.  Back on Memorial Day in late May, which many consider the unofficial start of summer, the U.S. was averaging fewer than 25,000 cases per day, but that number had risen above 160,000 by Labor Day. The daily case count in the U.S. is 316% higher than Labor Day weekend last year, and hospitalizations are up 158% from a year ago, USA Today reported Monday. A total of 648,910 Covid-related deaths have been recorded since the start of the pandemic, with the daily death rate spiking 55% over the past two weeks and the country averaging more than 1,500 fatalities per day for the first time since late March.  ""Last year, most of us were just burnt out because it was depressing and tragic,"" said Claire White, an ICU nurse at Mercy Hospital Northwest in Arkansas. ""Now, it's still depressing and tragic, but it could've been avoided."" With the delta variant of the coronavirus sweeping through the country, more than 102,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Sunday, according to a New York Times database. The average daily number of patients hospitalized by Covid-19 has climbed past 100,000 for the first time since the first week in February. As a result, medical facilities nationwide that have been worn thin by the relentless onslaught of the virus over the past 18 months are once again being stretched to or beyond capacity. Last week, Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) stated only four, out of nearly 400, adult ICU beds were available in the entire state. ""We are dangerously close to activating statewide crisis standards of care,"" Little said. ""In essence, someone would have to decide who can be treated and who cannot."" There were just eight available ICU beds in Arkansas in mid-August. Gov. Kate Brown (D-Ore.) announced last month she would deploy up to 1,500 National Guard members to support frontline health care workers. Oregon's Health Authority reported over the weekend that only 50 of 638 hospital beds were open. According to the most recent data from the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 75% of all inpatient beds in the country are occupied.  After the number of vaccine doses administered in the U.S. bottomed out at approximately 500,000 doses a day in late July, providers are now administering about 950,000 daily doses on average. However, 47% of all Americans are still not fully vaccinated, which has enabled the delta variant to spread. The Biden Administration had planned to make Covid-19 booster shots available to the general public in late September. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday it's ""conceivable"" that only Pfizer's shot will be approved by Sept. 20. Moderna's jab may be delayed ""at the most a couple of weeks.""   According to The Associated Press, the pandemic has led to a nurse staffing crisis that is forcing many hospitals to significantly increase wages to keep staff on the job. ""You leave work at the end of the day just exhausted by the effort it takes to (dig) that compassion up for people who are not taking care of themselves and the people around them,"" said Risa Moriarity, an executive at the University of Mississippi Medical Center's emergency department.  When Can You Get A Covid-19 Booster Shot?

"CM Punk defeated Darby Allin in his return match AEW All Out 2021 featured several newsworthy moments packed into on fantastic show. All Out had a Match of the Year contender, CM Punk’s first match in seven years (which was not the Match of the Year contender on this show) and three debuts of former WWE Superstars who were received like rockstars in AEW.  As pro wrestling kicks off the month of September, heading toward what will be a historic fall season for AEW and WWE, All Out kicked things off with a bang.  Miro and Eddie Kingston had one of the better opening matches in AEW history, which is saying a lot. Miro continued to look dominant as arguably AEW’s top heel, while Kingston marketed his viral phenomenon of “Redeem Deez Nuts,” which already has t-shirts available for sale on ShopAEW.com. Both AEW stars seemed elevated during this match, and after the finish was filled with referee controversy, this feud could be a candidate for a rare AEW rematch.  New Japan Pro Wrestling star Minoru Suzuki was very well received by Chicago hardcore fans, who even sang along to “Kaze Ni Nare.” In terms of in-ring chemistry and being well-matched, Suzuki and Jon Moxley very well may be pro wrestling soul mates. Even a brief preview of their inevitable match (which ended with Suzuki laying out Moxley with a Gotch piledriver) tore the house down.  Britt Baker had her best match since becoming AEW women’s world champion after defeating Kris Statlander. Statlander also showed very well as a babyface, managing to seize crowd support after the match began with Chicago firmly behind Baker. Baker was able to win them back, however, with a well-placed Adam Cole Easter Egg when she delivered the “Pittsburgh Sunrise.”  With Ruby SoHo now added to AEW’s women’s division and Thunder Rosa waiting in the wings, AEW is finally developing a deep roster of challengers for Baker.  The Lucha Bros had one of the all-time entrances you’ll ever see as they came out accompanied by pyro and a live performance. The crowd was on their side since the start of the match and throughout, and The Lucha Bros and Young Bucks rewarded them with a Match of the Year contender. Between their entrance and subsequent performance, by the end of the night The Lucha Bros were made into superstars.  The only way The Lucha Bros current momentum can be undone is with a quick title reign.  Ruby Soho, formerly known as Ruby Riott, was welcomed with open arms by AEW fans, making her debut as the Joker in the AEW Casino Battle Royale. Fans sang along to Soho’s new theme song, which is Ruby Soho by punk rock band Rancid. Soho went on to win the Casino Battle Royale, last eliminating Thunder Rosa.  Soho does not project to dethrone Britt Baker, so hopefully AEW is able to build her up with a string of wins prior to their world title match.  CM Punk’s return match garnered mixed reactions due to its slow pacing, but many agreed that he looked as if he had never left. Donning a new look with long tights, CM Punk was in prime physical condition and moved around very well with Darby Allin. Given what I saw tonight, there aren’t any doubts that Punk will be capable of having good-to-great matches with some of AEW’s top stars.  Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan each made their unannounced AEW debuts Sunday night at AEW All Out 2021. Both Bryan and Cole received raucous ovations from the NOW Arena in Chicago. More importantly, Cole and Bryan looked right at home in the AEW main event among their peers who made their names on the independent wrestling circuit—a prototype that AEW President Tony Khan has fallen in love with.  Three of the most popular stars in the AEW Casino Battle Royale were eliminated early, much to the chagrin of this Chicago crowd. This was never more the case than with the elimination of hometown favorite Skye Blue, who might have received the biggest ovation before the debut of Ruby Soho.  Paul Wight and QT Marshall’s match was placed in the popcorn spot, right after back-to-back emotionally charged matches. Wight and Marshall had to follow both Chris Jericho’s potential retirement match and CM Punk’s first match in seven years. There was no way this match was ever going have a chance under these circumstances, as this match was seemingly designed to give them a breather before the main event.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/06/aew-all-out-2021-results-cm-punk-and-the-winners-losers-of-chicago-ppv/,"AEW All Out 2021 Results: CM Punk And The Winners, Losers Of Chicago PPV"
"French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo in 'Ace of Aces' (1982). (Photo credit: Mondadori via Getty Images) French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo died today at the age of 88.  An icon, affectionately nicknamed Bebel in his native land, Belmondo is one of the most beloved and charismatic actors of French cinema. The French New Wave propelled him to fame and several more iconic roles with some of the greatest film directors, becoming France's biggest box-office star.  Born on April 9, 1933, of artist parents, the renowned sculptor Paul Belmondo and painter Madeleine Rainaud-Richard, Jean-Paul Belmondo trained as a stage actor in the prestigious Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique. In his 60-year career, Belmondo starred in over 80 films, starting with the French New Wave, he turned in the 1970s to comedy and action films and became known for his impressive movie stunts. With such an impressive filmography, it is difficult to pick just five movies. But if you were only to watch five films he starred in, these are the ones I would pick to start with.

[+] (Photo by LMPC via Getty Images) Jean-Paul Belmondo is most well-known internationally for his first major leading role. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, À Bout de Souffle saw Jean-Paul Belmondo play Michel Poiccard, a young delinquent hiding from the police in Paris where he meets the beautiful American Patricia, played by Jean Seberg, pacing the Champs-Elysées to sell copies of the New York Herald Tribune. Godard's iconic film, that was revolutionary in its style, propelled Belmondo to fame, becoming internationally known in the process. Belmondo will star in three more films directed by Godard. Breathless is available to rent on Amazon Prime Video and to stream on The Criterion Channel.  Jean Paul Belmondo and Emmanuelle Riva in "" Leon Morin, Priest "" (Photo by Roger Viollet via Getty ... [+] Images) With the success of À Bout de Souffle, Belmondo starred in seven films before getting the lead in Jean-Pierre Melville's Léon Morin, Priest in 1961, based on a novel by Béatrix Beck. His role as the young attractive priest in Melville's film is completely different to Michel Poiccard in À Bout de Souffle. The film tells the story of a young widow, played by Emmanuel Riva, who decides to have her daughter baptized during Nazi-occupied France. She meets with local priest Léon Morin, and they both find themselves confronted with their own religious faith as well as their own repressed sexual desires. Belmondo's performance here is both subtle and sensual, masterfully directed by Melville. Leon Morin, Priest is on KinoNow.

Belmondo plays gangster Silien, who helps his friend fresh out of prison Maurice Faugel, played by Serge Reggiani, prepare for another burglary. Silien, however, is a police informant. Le Doulos oozes with traditional noir themes and gangsters wearing trenchcoats and hats. This French noir is available to rent on Amazon Prime Video.  Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina in June 1965.

Belmondo plays Ferdinand, a family man who runs away with the babysitter, Marianne, played by Anna Karenina. The pseudo-romance quickly turns into a road movie filled with cliché French expressions and literary quotations. This was Belmondo's third collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard, after À Bout de Souffle and his musical Une Femme est une femme (A Woman Is A Woman). By the time Belmondo starred in Pierrot le Fou in 1965, he was already considered a huge star in France. Pierrot le Fou is on Apple TV and Prime Video.

[+] (Photo by Michel GINFRAY/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) In Fear Over the City, directed by Henri Verneuil, Belmondo plays police officer Jean Letellier tracking down a serial killer. The film is most famous for the scene in which Belmondo runs after the serial killer on top of the moving metro as it crosses the Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris. It is an incredible stunt sequence, which Belmondo did all himself. Fear Over the City is emblematic of the kind of movies Belmondo starred in, as well as produced, during the 1970s and 1980s. He had by then a predilection for action films, in which he famously did the stunts himself, such as in Le Guignolo which saw him hanging from a helicopter over Venice; or in L'Animal where Belmondo was standing on top of a moving airplane; or in the cult car chase sequence with the Eiffel Tower in the background in Le Professionel which is available to rent on Prime Video.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2021/09/06/5-essential-movies-starring-iconic-french-actor-jean-paul-belmondo-to-watch/,5 Essential Movies Starring Iconic French Actor Jean-Paul Belmondo To Watch
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wants to include the ""Clean Electricity Payment Program"" ... [+] a measure that could cost $200 billion, in the budget reconciliation process without holding any debate about the merits of the proposal or its potential impact on the electricity grid. (Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Pool/Getty Images) Back in December, after Congress passed the 5,593-page Covid relief and spending bill, the longest bill ever approved by that political body, Joe Concha, a columnist for The Hill, dubbed it the ""swampiest thing ever."" Concha added that it was ""exactly what one would expect from a dysfunctional, tone-deaf Congress: a pork-filled cluster...""   Well, Concha and his fellow observers of the Washington swamp should brace themselves because Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with other Democrats, think tanks, and academics, are hoping to jam through a measure known as the Clean Electricity Payment Program (CEPP) that has as much algae and kudzu on it as anything that has ever crawled out of the Bayou on the Potomac.  In an August 25 “Dear Colleague” letter, Schumer explained that the CEPP and other measures that he wants to include in the budget reconciliation process will be “the most significant climate action in our country’s history.” That may be true. But if the CEPP gets included in the reconciliation package, it could result in some of the biggest changes to the domestic electric grid since the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The CEPP will make payments to electricity companies that increase the amount carbon-free energy they sell and penalize those that don't. The goal of the program is to assure that 80% of the electricity generated in the U.S. comes from zero-carbon sources by 2030.  If the CEPP becomes law, it will likely provide even more subsidies for wind and solar energy and therefore create more distortions in wholesale electricity markets across dozens of states. By adding more wind and solar to the electric grid, the measure could have major impacts on electricity affordability, reliability, and societal resilience.  Despite its potential effects on the grid and consumers, there are no plans to debate the merits of the scheme. Instead, Democrats are hoping to include it in the reconciliation bill that will only require a simple majority of votes in the Senate.  To be clear, the inclusion of the CEPP in the reconciliation bill is not a foregone conclusion. Last week, Sen. Joe Manchin, the powerful Democrat from West Virginia, published an oped in the Wall Street Journal in which he made it clear that he wants to slow down the $3.5 trillion spending bill and “hit a strategic pause on the budget-reconciliation legislation.” Manchin’s opposition may be enough to stop the deal. Further, there are obstacles to the CEPP’s inclusion, including the fact that is not simply a budget maneuver. Instead, the scheme, which could cost as much as $200 billion, could result in wholesale changes to our most important piece of infrastructure, the electric grid. Further, it is facing doubts from electric cooperatives and publicly owned electric utilities.  Proponents of the CEPP, including left-leaning think tanks and academics, have claimed that the measure is a “technology-neutral policy” and can be used to support “wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, CCS, clean hydrogen and more.” That claim is disingenuous. Nuclear and hydropower plants cannot be built in the timeframe allowed by the CEPP, which if it were to be included in the budget, has to expire within 10 years. CCS and clean hydrogen are little more than vaporware.   One of the think tanks pushing the CEPP glides over the impact of the program and claims it “will not raise energy bills.” That’s a mighty big assumption given the amount of high-voltage transmission and other infrastructure that will be needed to accommodate a high-renewables scenario. It also ignores the situation in California, a state where, as I reported back in June, electricity prices are “absolutely exploding.” Recall that California has mandated 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045 and has an economy-wide goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. What are those mandates doing to prices? As reported last month by Environmental Progress, between 2011 and 2020, electricity prices “rose seven times more in California than they did in the rest of the country.” Furthermore, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, the all-sector price of electricity in California, jumped by 7.5% last year alone. That was the biggest price increase of any state in the country in 2020 and nearly seven times the increase that was seen in the United States as a whole. In 2020, the all-sector price of electricity in California jumped to 18.15 cents per kilowatt-hour, which means that Californians are now paying about 70% more for their electricity than the U.S. average all-sector rate of 10.66 cents per kWh. Those high energy prices are exacting a highly regressive tax on the poor and the middle class in California, a state that has the highest poverty rate in America.  Last month, Jim Matheson, the CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, sent a letter to Congressional leaders saying that it is “imperative that Congress preserves access to reliable and affordable electricity” and that any “energy and climate policies that Congress considers must include realistic, reasonable, and achievable timelines.” Matheson also said that while the share of electricity generated from hydrocarbons will likely “continue to decline, it will remain a necessary source of reliable, affordable electricity due to the intermittency of renewable power generation  resources and limitations of long-term energy storage options.”  Last week, the Financial Times reported that members of the American Public Power Association, which represents about 1,400 municipal-owned utilities are also expressing “nervousness” about the CEPP and whether they will be able to “keep electricity affordable and reliable” for their customers.    A final point: regardless of the staggering cost of the CEPP or its potential impacts on the electric grid, the proposal is a gobsmackingly bad way to make policy. If proponents of grid decarbonization want to see that happen, they should be willing to debate the merits of it instead of trying to sneak such an important bit of legislation into a budget bill.  Yes, that’s the way the swamp works these days. But that doesn’t make it right.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2021/09/06/the-proposed-clean-electricity-payment-program-could-vie-for-title-of-swampiest-thing-ever/,"Senate Leaders Push ‘Clean Electricity Payment Program’ - A $200 Billion Green New Deal, With Big Implications"
"U.S. crooks purloined 880,595 cars, trucks, and SUVs during 2020, which represents a 10.9 percent ... [+] increase over 2019. Yet another unfortunate byproduct of Covid-19 was a reported surge in vehicle thefts last year, fueled by the plethora of cars left parked due to work-at-home recommendations and select shutdowns to help curtail the spread of Covid-19. According to the annual “Hot Spots” report issued by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), U.S. crooks purloined 880,595 cars, trucks, and SUVs during 2020, which represents a 10.9 percent increase over 2019, with one vehicle illegally driven off an average of once every 36 seconds. With far fewer motorists taking to the streets and highways for much of last year and leaving their vehicles unattended for days at a time, criminals were able to purposefully pick their targets like shoppers perusing the racks at Target. This is especially true among city dwellers that tended to leave their cars parked on the streets for days and weeks on end, walking to stores and other essential businesses instead of driving. Suburbanites and those who remained mobile throughout the pandemic weren’t spared, however, especially the disturbingly high number of vehicle owners who reported their rides missing simply because their owners either left the keys in the ignition or had the keyless-entry key fob sitting in a bin or cup holder while parked. “Auto thefts saw a dramatic increase in 2020 versus 2019 in part due to the pandemic, an economic downturn, law enforcement realignment, depleted social and schooling programs, and, in still too many cases, owner complacency,” says David Glawe, president and CEO of the NICB.  Auto thefts jumped the most last year in Colorado, with 29,162 thefts reported in 2020, over 21,299 registered in 2019—that represents a whopping 37 increase. California leads all U.S. states in total thefts at 187,094 taken during 2020, with Bakersfield, CA topping all urban areas at a theft rate of 905.41 vehicles stolen per 100,000 residents. We’re featuring lists of the states and localities suffering the most car thefts in the lists below.  While one might think flashy new cars might be the models most frequently targeted by criminals, for the most part the opposite is the case. The NICB notes that older vehicles, especially those that originally sold in large numbers, continue to be most frequently preferred by thieves. They include well-worn versions of the Honda Accord and Civic, Toyota Camry and Corolla, and the Chevrolet Silverado, Ford F-150, GMC Sierra, and Dodge/Ram full-size pickup trucks. They’re most often driven or towed to so-called chop shops where key components are harvested and sold to unscrupulous auto parts dealers and/or to unsuspecting consumers via the Internet. At that, law enforcement agencies in large metropolitan areas have recorded an upsurge in thefts of high-performance cars like the Dodge Challenger and Charger, especially those packing the 700-plus horsepower Hellcat and Redeye supercharged V8 versions. Earlier this year, parent company Stellantis issued flash-downloadable security upgrades for those models that impair drivability if the system detects a break-in.  Often, key components can be harvested right where a vehicle is parked, and quickly enough to go unnoticed even in daylight. The most common among these easy-money thefts is the catalytic converter, which is an especially valuable part of a car or truck’s emissions control system that uses costly precious metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium to convert an engine’s environmentally hazardous exhaust into less harmful gasses. As of December 2020, rhodium was valued at $14,500 per ounce, palladium at $2,336 per ounce, and platinum going for $1,061 per ounce. Typically, recyclers will pay $50 to $250 for a “recycled” catalytic converter.  According to NICB’s Operations, Intelligence and Analytics study of reported thefts, there were 108 catalytic reported converter thefts per month on average in 2018, 282 average monthly thefts reported in 2019, and 1,203 average thefts reported per month in 2020. The top five states for catalytic converter thefts last year were California, Texas, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Illinois.  “Removing a catalytic converter takes only minutes using some basic, readily-available, battery-operated tools from a local hardware store,” added Glawe. “And for the vehicle owner, it’s costly due to the loss of work, finding and paying for alternate transportation and then paying anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 to get your vehicle fixed.”  It’s always prudent to install an anti-theft device to add a layer of vehicular security, especially one that protects the catalytic converter. Aside from that, the usual cautions apply, namely to park in your garage at home and in a well-lit and well-populated spot out on public, and to always lock the car and take the keys with you, no matter for how short a period it may take to pay for gas or run into the post office. Here’s the list of the NICB’s top 10 metropolitan “hot spots” for vehicle thefts relative to population size during 2020, with the number of vehicles stolen per 100,000 residents noted in parenthesis:   And here’s which states reported the most car thefts per 100,000 residents last year, according to the NICB:   You can read the NICB’s full report here.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2021/09/06/heres-where-car-thefts-are-spiking-because-of-the-pandemic/,Here’s Where Car Thefts Are Spiking Because Of The Pandemic
"Movie theaters may have face mask requirements and air filtration devices in place. But will that be ... [+] enough?(Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Shang-Chi gave the struggling movie industry a major boost this weekend. The latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, opened in movie theaters throughout the U.S. and Canada, raking in an estimated $71.4 million as of Monday morning. That’s already set a record for Labor Day Weekend movie debut, as Good Morning America reported here: Now, Shang-Chi has a major drawing card. It was the first Hollywood superhero movie featuring male lead of Asian-descent since, well, forever. An Asian American (or Asian Canadian, which is the background of Shang-Chi star Simu Liu) as a male lead in any Hollywood movie has been rarer than cats being elected to public office. So Asian Americans and Asian Canadians may have flocked to the movie as if it were a total solar eclipse. In fact, about 17% of viewers over the weekend were of Asian decent, which is over twice the typical percentage of filmgoers for a Marvel film. So Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings may not be your typical Hollywood film.  The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has already delayed the release of many Hollywood films. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was originally scheduled to come out on February 12. It’s place in Phase 4 of the MCU franchise prevented it from being delayed any further. Thor: Love and Thunder is moving from a November 5, 2021 to a May 6, 2022 release date, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness from May 7, 2021, to March 25, 2022, and Avatar 2 from December 17, 2021, to December 16, 2022. Oh and what seems like the hundredth rendition of The Batman will go from an October 1, 2021, release data to a March 4, 2022, one. Clearly, Hollywood studios are worried that many people may not be returning to theaters until 2022. Things don’t look super promising for the last four months of 2021. Right now, Covid-19 coronavirus cases are continuing to surge throughout the country. According to the New York Times, the seven-day moving average of new reported Covid-19 cases each day was 161,327 yesterday. That’s over 14 times the 11,133 tally on June 20. For the first time since March, the average Covid-19 deaths per day in U.S. have pushed over the 1,500 mark.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently lists “watch a movie at a theater” as a “Less Safe” indoor activities. Regardless of what kind of ventilation and air filtration system is in place, it may not be enough to overcome the fact that people are sitting close together for a couple of hours. That’s assuming that the ventilation system doesn’t turn the theater into a wind tunnel. Requiring everyone to wear face masks can help. However, theaters may not be able to make sure that theatergoers wear their face masks throughout the film. Moreover, face masks alone can be a bit like telling everyone in a business meeting, “you only have to wear underwear.” Instead, it’s better to have at least two layers of Covid-19 precautions, the more the better.  Ultimately, theaters may have to implement vaccination requirements. Sure, the available Covid-19 vaccines aren’t like full body concrete condoms. You can still get infected and develop Covid-19 even when fully vaccinated, albeit your chances are much lower. But a theater full of fully vaccinated people is certainly going to be a whole lot safer than one with any number of unvaccinated individuals.  Of course, instituting vaccination requirements will exclude the potentially sizeable chunk of people who still refuse to get vaccinated. Those unvaccinated may claim that it’s discrimination and it’s their Constitutional right to watch Paw Patrol: The Movie, while breathing heavily on others. They may yell something about The Deep State or some secret plan to turn everyone into gigantic magnets and 5G devices so that the movies can be streamed through their bodies while keys can stick to their heads.  Nevertheless, theaters must realize that the fully vaccinated may stay away until they can have some kind of guarantee that everyone in the theater is vaccinated. Plus, the consequences of a Covid-19 outbreak can be financially devastating. The answer to “where should we go on Saturday night” is not likely to be “how about the theater that recently had that big Covid-19 outbreak?” While the Shang-Chi opening may have given theaters some optimism for the coming months, it is important to remember that this was in many ways a historic film and may not represent the new norm. Again, it isn’t every day that a Hollywood film features a male of Asian decent who doesn’t say something like “no more yankie my wankie. The Donger need food!” Moreover, Asian Americans and their allies may be looking for a respite after a year-and-a-half of enduring anti-Asian hate, racism, and ridiculousness like people calling the Covid-19 coronavirus the “kung-flu virus, as I have covered before for Forbes. Imagine how well Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings could have done had this not been in the middle of the pandemic.  No, the rest of 2021 may be quite different from this Labor Day. Especially with the seasons about to change, movie theaters may have to consider changing their scripts.

" A judge ruled that Bryan Riley, the 33-year-old former Marine sharpshooter Florida police say shot and killed a mother, her three-month-old baby, and two others in Florida over the weekend, will be held in custody without bail. This booking photo provided by the Polk County, Fla. Sheriff's Office shows Bryan Riley, who was ... [+] arrested Sunday over a quadruple homicide. Riley made his first court appearance Monday morning, where he was charged with a myriad of offenses related to the killings, including four counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder of law enforcement officers and denied bond. Riley is in custody at Polk County Jail in Bartow, Florida, according to inmate records. Police say Riley broke into a home and a neighboring apartment in an unincorporated area of Lakeland, Florida, about 35 miles east of Tampa, on Saturday where he allegedly shot and killed Justice Gleason along with a 33-year-old woman, her 3-month-old baby son and the woman’s 62-year-old grandmother who have not been publicly identified by law enforcement, Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County said Sunday. Authorities said the attack also left an 11-year-old girl in the home “significantly injured” with multiple gunshot wounds, who remained in critical condition at a nearby hospital on Monday morning, though she is expected to recover. Judd said Riley, dressed in camouflage and full-coverage body armor, engaged in a shootout from the home with the police officers who responded to the scene before surrendering.  There is no evidence to suggest Riley was connected in any way to the victims, Judd said. Authorities say Riley served four years in the Marines and did tours of Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged, and spent another three years in the reserves. He works as a bodyguard for ESS Global Corporation, a Florida-based security consulting firm that offers bodyguard training. Judd said Riley’s girlfriend told police he had post traumatic stress disorder and depression but had never been violent during their four-year relationship, though he had behaved erratically in the weeks leading up to the attack. ""Just because you have mental health problems doesn't mean you're not criminally liable,"" Judd said Sunday. ""There are millions that struggle with mental health that don't do this."" Riley has a concealed weapons license, Judd said. Police say Riley first went to the Lakeland neighborhood Saturday evening, where he told residents he had been called by God to prevent a woman named Amber from taking her own life. Neighbors told him no one named Amber lived in the area, Judd said, but Judd said Riley refused to leave until residents called law enforcement. Police said Riley returned roughly nine hours later, where he opened fire. In custody, Judd said Riley told officers he had taken methamphetamine. Police are still investigating the crime scene, Judd said.

"The U.S. Justice Department said Monday it won’t tolerate violence against any women seeking to obtain an abortion or any health service facility providing abortions in Texas, following the passage of a restrictive abortion law in the state last week, and is currently exploring options to challenge the new law to protect women’s constitutional rights. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 05: U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announces a federal investigation ... [+] of the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department during a news conference at the Department of Justice on August 05, 2021 in Washington, DC. Garland said the Justice Department has opened a pattern or practice investigation into the City of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department to determine if they have violated federal laws or citizens constitutional rights. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The Justice Department said it will protect those who are “seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” by continuing its enforcement of a federal law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits threats or use of force to  “injure, intimidate or interfere” with someone seeking an abortion or providing abortion services. The law also prohibits anyone from intentionally damaging any facility providing reproductive health services. The Justice Department said it will provide federal law enforcement support in Texas and has already discussed enforcement with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and FBI field offices in the state. The announcement comes a few days after President Joe Biden directed his administration to take steps to combat the Texas abortion law by looking in to “legal tools” available that Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice could use to help provide abortion access. “We will not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services, physical obstruction or property damage in violation of the FACE Act,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement. Texas’ new restrictive abortion law was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in May, and went into effect on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court voted 5-4, allowing the law to take effect. The law bans abortion after signs of a fetal heartbeat are detected, which can be picked up by an ultrasound about six weeks from conception. It also allows private citizens to help enforce the abortion ban by allowing them to file a lawsuit against anyone who may be “aiding and abetting” an abortion, up to $10,000. Biden has criticized the law, saying that it “blatantly violates” constitutional rights established under Roe v. Wade, and said that his administration will “protect and defend” rights established under that ruling.  Private companies have also spoken out against the restrictive abortion law in Texas. On Friday, rideshare companies Lyft and Uber said separately they would cover legal fees for any driver under their platform that gets sued for transporting a passenger to a health clinic to receive an abortion, which can be considered “aiding and abetting” an abortion under the law. Dating apps Match and Bumble each said they would also create funds to help Texans access abortion services.  Biden Vows Action Against Texas Abortion Ban With ‘Whole-Of-Government Effort’ (Forbes) Texas Now Has The Most Restrictive Abortion Law In The U.S.—Here’s What Could Happen Next (Forbes) Lyft And Uber Offer To Pay Legal Fees For Drivers Sued Under Texas Abortion Law (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/09/06/justice-department-will-protect-women-seeking-abortions-under-texas-abortion-ban/,Justice Department Will ‘Protect’ Women Seeking Abortions Under Texas Abortion Ban
"Call Of Duty: Vanguard We’ve already seen the big Call Of Duty: Vanguard reveal and we’ve played in the game’s Alpha, where we tried out the new Champion Hill mode. In the big game reveal we learned a lot about the upcoming shooter’s setting and era. It’s a WW2 game that takes place across four different theaters of war. We also learned when the game is coming out and various other important details. During the Alpha we were able to try out the game’s new tournament Champion Hill mode which fans—myself included—had deeply mixed feelings about. Next up we have the big multiplayer reveal. This is probably the most important of all, since most players spend more time with multiplayer than they do with the campaign. We’ll learn about game modes, the game’s 16 launch maps (or at least some of them) and more. This will all be in anticipation of the upcoming beta weekends where players will be able to demo multiplayer for the first time. The Call Of Duty: Vanguard multiplayer reveal takes place Tuesday, September 7th at 10 am PST / 1 pm EST / 6 pm BST. Activision and Sledgehammer have not specified where the reveal will take place yet, but you should head over to the Call of Duty YouTube channel and/or Twitch channel as it’s likely the reveal will take place on either or both—unlike the game’s big reveal in Warzone. Update: Here’s some links: Also stay tuned to this blog and to my YouTube channel as I have a lot of Call Of Duty: Vanguard content in the pipeline as well, including unlocking whatever is in this mystery Call Of Duty: Vanguard ammo box that was sent to me. The reveal shouldn’t take too long. I predict around 30 minutes to an hour. Expect lots and lots of Vanguard content to flood the internet tomorrow morning from press, YouTubers and streamers. You should have a pretty clear picture of what to expect before heading into the beta over the next couple of weekends. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

"A view of the Hollywood Hills backdrops the rooftop pool at The Dream Hollywood, California is obviously no stranger to cutting-edge nightlife. So when the Dream Hotel opened in this famously vibrant section of Los Angeles five years ago, it needed to come correct. This took the form of diverse lounge and leisure options accompanying its 178 stylish guest rooms. The energy runs from a modern and verdant lobby through the marquee food and dining and up onto a 11,000-square-foot rooftop lounge, suspended between skyline and Hollywood Hills. Beauty & Essex as well as Tao Asian Bistro—two well-known commodities at the convergence of fine-dining and nightlife—both operate expansive outposts here. But in this hype-heavy part of town, it’s never enough to just rest on your laurels. To stay relevant you need to keep up with the latest trends. Whatever is capturing the imagination at the moment, a true Hollywood hotspot ought to be on top of it—often times this involves a finger on the pulse of art or technology. In the case of the Dream’s latest exhibit—it means both. The Crypt Gallery is the hotel’s newest addition: one of the city’s first collections of NFT art that’s completely open to the public. Later this season it will pop up at the hotel chain’s New York location, Dream Downtown. If you’re not entirely familiar with the concept, built around “non-fungible tokens”, you certainly are not alone. And this particular exhibit is designed to be informative in that regard. Educational plagues peppered across the walls of the space explain the basics of NFT art; how it is created, sold, and re-sold. QR codes on display link to additional information available on related websites while you’re exploring the space. But the best way to get answers is to go directly to the source. So we sat down with the collector responsible for The Crypt Gallery. In an exclusive interview with Forbes, Athanasios Polihronopoylos—who goes by the moniker “The King Of Midtown”—helps us better understand NFT art and why it works so well in a hip Hollywood hotel.  There's a lot to unpack and address with that question. I just want to start off by saying, this is just the beginning. In terms of what people are discovering with NFTs and their capabilities, there is a huge connection to DeFi (Decentralized Finance). NFTs tie into multiple components including authenticity, creators independently working for themselves, the discovery of new art forms, and finding a supportive community that continues to grow. NFTs are a revolution. It is only a matter of time before everyone realizes it. I believe COVID definitely influenced the growth of the digital art market, at least for myself and many others while in lockdown. That being said, NFTs are not just a temporary craze. As larger brands and corporations, like Visa get involved, as well as celebrities and fine art auction houses, the mainstream is starting to hear more and more about NFTs. Institutions, such as banks, once opposed cryptocurrencies, but after seeing the momentum and scale of this movement, they are now jumping in. The same applies to NFTs. Major fine art collectors are now transitioning into purchasing digital art pieces, famous physical artists are producing digital assets to pair with their works, fashion, sports and the music industry are all entering the space. We are witnessing a modern day Renaissance, one which involves cryptocurrency, blockchains and NFTs. And the artists dedicating their time and talent to the space are becoming the new celebrities. The hospitality industry seemed like the perfect location for this type of project. Not only do hotels offer high exposure, but they also provide a fun ambiance to hang out and spend time in. Compared to traditional art galleries with white walls and classic presentations, high-end hotels create an ideal environment to house The Crypt Gallery. Aside from the atmosphere, hotels also provide a high volume of rotating guests, many of them international and visiting for a variety of reasons. This was key in trying to educate and bring NFTs to the mainstream. A hotel's reach also reflects the global scale of NFTs. Whether it be tourists, business travelers or meetings attendees, the exposure provided in hotels is hard to duplicate elsewhere. Dream Hotel Group was the hospitality brand that instantly came to mind when envisioning The Crypt Gallery. Each of their properties is unique in terms of architecture and design, yet the emphasis placed on the arts is obvious in all locations. Dream Hollywood has always been known as a trendsetter and one of the most popular spots in LA. The well designed lobby space creates an ambiance people gravitate towards and want to hang out in. The restaurant scene, rooftop and constant events happening on property just add to the fact that everyone wants to be here. Overall, Dream just provides the perfect physical space to house this innovative and rare exhibition. I mean, the name itself speaks on their creativity and self-expression... They helped bring our dream to life.

" Thanks to changing weather conditions, firefighters made major headway containing Northern California’s Caldor fire over the weekend, leading to evacuation orders being downgraded and allowing residents living south of Lake Tahoe, one of the most populated areas to be threatened by the fire, to return home. Firefighter Elroy Valadez spray water over a spot fire from the Caldor Fire burning along Highway 89 ... [+] near South Lake Tahoe, Calif. On Monday morning, the Caldor fire had been 44% contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said, nearly double what the agency reported Thursday. Authorities said lower temperatures, slowing winds and rises in humidity allowed firefighters to take advantage of the slowed pace of the wildfire to focus on mitigation efforts to keep the blaze from spreading further. As the situation improves, authorities are gradually downgrading and lifting previous evacuation orders, allowing tens of thousands of residents living in and around South Lake Tahoe to return home. However, officials said Monday morning that winds could pick up again throughout the day and that weather conditions looked dry, warning first responders and residents that they aren’t yet “out of the woods” when it comes to the wildfire. 216,358. That’s how large in acres the Caldor fire was on Monday morning, California Fire authorities said. Authorities said nine people have been injured since the Caldor fire began, 7 of whom were first responders, while 714 single homes had been destroyed. California Fire authorities expect the fire to be completely contained within the next three weeks, they said Monday morning. The Caldor fire began burning east of Sacramento three weeks ago and gradually spread further east to even threaten the border of Nevada on the other side of Lake Tahoe, one of the states’ most popular holiday destinations. More than 40,000 residents and tourists evacuated the area within the past few weeks. The Caldor fire is just one of seven active wildfires burning in California, according to Cal Fire. While wildfires have always been a problem in California, the agency says climate change has driven the state’s wildfire season to last longer than in previous years. California is facing its worst drought in decades, which has intensified the wildfires this summer.

"Jose Andres with Dave Grohl and Liam Mayclem Jose Andres, chef extraordinaire was, in my opinion, the most compelling performer at BottleRock 2021.  Andres appeared at the Williams Sonoma 
  
  WSM 
  Culinary Stage on Sunday afternoon, partnered with Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters.  Their performance had the same audience engaging repartee which we saw from other successful pairings there: Todd English and Derek Hough, Michael Mina with Adam Sobel and James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem to name a few.  The gig is simple:  30 minutes of stage time to make silly comments and demonstrate a relatively simple way to cook a unique dish.  Mina and Sobel made filo dough crusted halibut with a beurre blanc sauce and caviar, English with his daughter Isabelle, who runs Williams Sonoma’s test kitchen, made a single giant ravioli filled with an ostrich egg yolk, a pesto mascarpone and finished in a truffle butter.  Andres pan fried eggs and delivered a poignant lesson in community and empathy. Andres, proprietor of many superior restaurants such as Jaleo, Minibar and The Bazaar is the founder of World Central Kitchen which is well known for going into disaster sites and setting up kitchens to feed the displaced and the humbled.  His work has been profiled everywhere including 60 minutes. It is so important that World Central Kitchen just received a  $100 million donation from Jeff Bezos. Andres’ dish at BottleRock’ culinary stage was a twist on a simple tapa. Eggs fried in oil to which he added potato chips, sliced jamon Iberico, caviar and uni.  As Andres added ingredients, one by one to his fried egg filled pan he spoke about how the eggs took some time to get used to the idea the potato chips were added to the pan, then that the eggs and potatoes had to adjust when the jamon came in.  It became quickly clear this was all a parable for mixing races and cultures.  Andres himself reinforced the point noting the items in his pan came from different places, had different backgrounds and didn’t share the same religion, but they still found a way to come together.  This bravura performance took place on a hot afternoon before a giant crowd who mostly showed up to see America’s favorite rock n roll Dad – Dave Grohl.  Grohl, who fronts the Foo Fighters, is no slouch when it comes to commanding attention from a crowd.  However, this time he was rapidly sidelined as comedy relief while Andres delivered his lesson. Andres, speaking with the cadence of a Sunday preacher delivering a sermon to a mostly homogenous crowd whose primary divisions lay in political party or whether they believe that wealth accumulation distinguishes the worthy from those who are lazy or incapable. The egg frying chef’s powerful oratory culminated when he opened the front of his button down shirt to reveal a T shirt beneath which read: Immigrants Feed America. Imagine, after this day and age, when highly affluent crowds of people who call the Bay Area home, and those with the capacity to travel for luxuries like music festivals will be able to hear truth about how people from different socio-economic statuses, religions and places of origin can mix like the ingredients Andres put into his pan.   As for the festival itself, BottleRock went through the wringer on the way to putting on their 2021 event.  They lost scheduled dates in May of 2020 and 2021, and October 2020 before actually being able to go forward September 3-5, 2021.  During the shutdown their team faced moving Covid targets, weather, wildfires, changes to consumer behavior, the cancellation by one of their headliners who was afraid of the growing threat from the Delta virus and the complete shut down and restart of ticketing. However, on September 3-5, 2021 the show went on as scheduled. It was a beautiful weather weekend.  Oh, except this thing: on Friday morning, as the show was about to kick off, Chris Stapleton the headliner replacing Stevie Nicks who cancelled last month because of the Delta virus spread himself called in sick leaving the show with no headliner.  BottleRock scrambled and pulled together Brandi Carlyle and Marren Morris who were already scheduled to play sets on the big Jam Cellars stage to also to step in and headline as their alter ego band the Highwomen. Beyond that, the festival went forward normally.  This is my fifth time to BottleRock.  It’s one of my favorite festivals.  BottleRock has a careful focus on bringing in good food, excellent wines and curates a lovely festival in a tight footprint so the walk between stages is never more than a couple of minutes.  Walking back into the festival felt exactly like it did in 2019 – the last iteration before the pandemic. Well, there was one difference.  This time we were very aware of crowds and Covid.  What amazed me was the absolute lack of masks.  There were more children there under five than there were people wearing masks.  Here’s what I saw more than frequently than masks: senior citizens, pink hair, tattoos, vintage concert T’s, underboob and vapes. I’d estimate the percentage of people wearing masks to be less than 5%.  It was startling and for the first time at a festival I was not in the mix of the people, I was toward the edges at the back.   BottleRock 2021, Sunday afternoon. Maskless crowds. There was something else I noticed:  the festival sold out quickly when put on sale, but in the four weeks running up to the kickoff, ticket prices crashed.  People afraid of the Delta virus spread were dumping tickets on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and of course the resale market was cratering.  By show time on Friday, after Chris Stapleton canceled there was near zero interest in tickets from potential buyers outside the festival grounds.   I watched a tightly organized resale crew working the boundaries of the festival.  BottleRock is essentially a rectangle in the middle of city streets with two main entry points.  At every street leading to those entry points, both at the entry point and strategically back along those streets, on both sides, were members of a team whose job it was to purchase wristbands as cheaply as possible, offering $100 per 3 day ticket on the first day of the event, and $50 per ticket on the second day, then reselling them for double or better if they could.  The brilliance of this strategy was that anyone who had an extra ticket they wanted to sell simply caved and took the low bid because there was almost no way to fight them for a buyer.  All the traffic of potential buyers walked past several of these guys before anyone trying to sell their own extra ticket at the gate could get near them.  Because they were organized, this crew had fairly consistent bid prices for tickets and there was no ability to work one seller against another as they were all collaborating.  It’s a brilliant strategy, running into the hole left when StubHub abandoned pop up last minute ticket sales offices at major events. The crowd seemed light on Friday, but swelled noticeably on Saturday, likely a combination of the weekend arriving and the two headliners: Guns n Roses and Miley Cyrus.  GnR started on time at 7:30pm, an hour before Miley.  They both finished at 10, although I noticed a substantial movement to the second stage as Miley’s set got underway.  Miley finished with Wrecking Ball and Party in the USA.  GnR finished with P!NK making a surprise appearance on Patience, followed by Dave Grohl joining for most of Paradise City before the sound system was cut off at 10pm. BottleRock is adjacent to a residential neighborhood and their team is deadly serious about adhering to the sound curfew. For me, Sunday was the best of the three days.  There is an adjustment process involved when going back into a festival space, and I say this as someone who was just in NYC for half of their Central Park concert before it abruptly canceled due to dangerous weather coming from tropical storm Henri.  The Napa weather on Sunday was hot, but the sky was a brilliant blue and there were not shortages at any of the beer or wine outlets.  One small irritant:  BottleRock allowed sealed bottles of water to be brought in on Friday and Saturday, then confiscated every single one on Sunday.  Why? On the hottest day of the festival, it makes more sense to keep people hydrated.  They’ll still buy beverages. I also really liked the closing lineup, which for me went: Black Pumas, Cage the Elephant and Foo Fighters.  My intention had been to wander more, to also catch Jack Harlow, Jon Baptiste and Megan Thee Stallion, but the beers were 19 oz and the music was so good I just stayed put. Over the past couple of years I’ve inadvertently begun following the Foo Fighters, having now seen them at least a dozen times in the two years prior to Covid, and again now at BottleRock.  They played with a particular urgency last night.  It was such a nice way to the end the weekend.  As I left the grounds I remembered why I went to 11 festivals in 2019.  There’s something about the collective cathartic energy of a crowd.  I’d missed it.  There’s a buzz from the crowd, even if this year there’s also some dissonance from being Covid cautious among the unmasked. Ultimately, an expensive music festival weekend is a frivolity. As Taylor Hawkins said from the main stage during the Foo Fighters’ set: “are you enjoying your wine and cheese festival?”  But, if there are any lessons to be learned from the past year and half of Covid, perhaps they are these: the objective of life is not more money, possessions or status.  None of those mattered when we were all sequestered.  What mattered was community.  That’s a lesson which could be well learned by our embarrassing political class and one which was perfectly taught yesterday by an immigrant chef from Spain who recognizing the privileges afforded by success  simply took it upon himself to feed the needy during crisis and now to provide a reminder about humility and power of human connection.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericfuller/2021/09/06/jose-andres-wins-bottlerock-festivals-return-the-same-but-different/,"Jose Andres Wins BottleRock.

"As more countries move to offer a third dose of the vaccine, Europe’s medicines regulator said Monday it has started an expedited evaluation of whether it should recommend booster shots in the region, a decision it said could come “within the next few weeks.”  The European Medicines Agency has launched an expedited review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement posted to its website that it has started “evaluating” an application for booster shot approval sent in by vaccine maker Pfizer.  The “accelerated assessment” will look at whether the shot is necessary “to restore protection after it has waned” about six months after vaccination for people 16 years and older.  To make this decision, regulators will look at the results from an ongoing trial in which roughly 300 adults with health immune systems received a booster shot.  The EMA also said it is “separately” assessing data on the use of an additional dose of mRNA vaccines for people with weak immune systems, though it did not specify a timeline for that decision. The regulatory agency highlighted that it does “not consider the need for Covid-19 vaccine booster doses to be urgent in the general population,” but is “evaluating the present application to ensure evidence is available to support further doses as necessary.”  A growing number of countries, including the U.S., have moved to approve and supply Covid-19 booster shots following evidence suggesting the protection of vaccines wanes over time. Some studies have indicated vaccines become less effective at preventing infection months after inoculation, though they still remain highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization and death.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized countries offering booster shots while other nations have barely started vaccinations. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus late last month called for a two-month moratorium on boosters, questioning the necessity of a third jab and highlighting the risk of “more potent” variants emerging in countries with “low vaccination coverage.”  “When Can You Get A Covid-19 Booster Shot?” (Forbes) “WHO Leader Asks For Two-Month Pause On Booster Shots—Questioning Current Necessity And Highlighting Risk Of ‘More Potent’ Variants” (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/06/decision-on-covid-vaccine-boosters-in-europe-coming-within-weeks-regulator-says/,"Decision On Covid Vaccine Boosters In Europe Coming Within ‘Weeks,’ Regulator Says"
"Rick and Morty are bested by Evil Morty The two-part Rick and Morty season finale begins with the titular two separated, once again, with Morty having grown sick of being disrespected, and Rick twisting the knife by replacing Morty with a joke sidekick - two crows, underlining how little Morty means to him.  Rick pushes the “two crows” joke as far as it’ll go, to the point where he unironically embraces his new feathered friends (Rick really does have a thing for birds, huh?), while Morty gets involved with a new adventuring partner, Nick, who turns out to be even more twisted than Rick.  The two might be connected via spilled portal fluid, but Morty manages to slaughter his new “friend” by amputating his own hand and pushing the two portals together, causing his companion to be sucked into the resulting void. It’s a creative kill, another indication that Morty has learned to take care of himself.  Nevertheless, he still wants to be with his grandfather. Rick, however, has moved on, suddenly keen to leave his toxic relationship with Morty behind.  Hence, Rick becomes the star of his own anime-inspired adventure, becoming a crow-themed wanderer on an endless journey that never quite reaches its conclusion. In an attempt to guilt-trip his grandfather into coming home, Morty transforms himself into a defeated-looking middle-aged man, but the attempt fails - Rick seems happy where he is, for once.  He couldn’t convince Bird Person to join him on his adventures, so he’s become something of a Bird Person himself. At least, until he discovers that his two crow companions are ‘cheating on him” with their arch-nemesis, pushing Rick into returning to Morty, back to his old ways.  But Morty is still middle-aged - to fix him, the two return to the Citadel, where a dedicated Morty repair shop is always running (for obvious reasons). Hence, the show finally delivers a conclusion to a side-story that fans have been craving since season 1 - the saga of Evil Morty, who is now president of the Citadel.  Rick and Morty have dinner with Evil Morty - amusingly, Rick knows that there’s going to be a plot twist on the horizon, a devious plan bound to be revealed. And Evil Morty doesn’t disappoint, showing Morty the true nature of his existence.  Rick’s tragic origin story has been teased for years, but it turns out that the “fabricated” version Rick recreated during season 3 was indeed accurate - his wife and child (young Beth) really were murdered by another Rick, who figured out the portal gun technology before our Rick did.  Hence, Rick spent his life cataloging the multiverse, murdering every Rick he could find in a futile attempt to avenge the murder of his family. Despite banding together, the other Ricks were no match for our Rick, the “Rickest Rick.”  After failing to find the murderer, Rick and the other Ricks reached a truce, with Rick helping to design the Citadel, which quickly became something of a breeding factory for Mortys, who are valuable due to their brainwaves functioning as a kind of cloaking device for their grandfather, who is always on the run from … well, somebody.  There’s a lot of exposition to get through, yet the episode feels like a guilty pleasure, answering several burning questions that the show’s writers always seemed reluctant to answer. It’s revealed that Rick, despite hating Jerry, had a hand in pushing Beth and Jerry together throughout the multiverse, in a bid to create more Mortys. This explains why Beth and Jerry’s marriage is so unstable - it’s a relationship designed to create Morty, and nothing more.  Foreseeing a mass exodus, Evil Morty poisoned all the portal fluid to slaughter Ricks as they attempt to escape, and has engineered the Citadel as a gigantic superweapon, built to break open the “Central Finite Curve.”  This, it turns out, has been Evil Morty’s plan from the beginning. Because the Central Finite Curve is a subsection of the multiverse, walled off from the rest of infinity, a safe space where Rick is always the smartest being in the universe.  Rick, it seems, didn’t like the idea of being challenged by potential peers, or facing more intelligent entities that didn’t resemble him - there must be far smarter beings out in the multiverse than Rick, beyond the Curve - hell, there’s probably a genius Jerry out there. Ensuring that nobody could breach that boundary is a very Rick thing to do; it’s an act of genius, drenched in crippling insecurity.  All Evil Morty wants to do is escape, and live in a reality not dominated by his grandfather, to escape the toxic dynamic of the show entirely. And who can blame him?  Evil Morty’s plan really wasn’t so evil at all - he might have murdered countless Ricks and Mortys to achieve his goal, but he’s just playing by his grandfather’s rules. All the kid wants is freedom - Rick’s attempt to control reality itself is undoubtedly worse than the actions Evil Morty took to break free.  Finally, Evil Morty offers Morty a place on his ship, which even Rick advises Morty to take. The alternative is a lifetime of dangerous adventures, trapped forever in an abusive cycle with Rick. Thankfully for us viewers, Morty chooses to stay with his grandfather, leaving Evil Morty to escape into the true multiverse, disappearing into a mysterious golden portal.  And that’s it - Evil Morty won. Rick’s dark secret has been revealed and destroyed; we’ve seen Rick be humbled this season, but this has been his greatest defeat thus far.  This episode is probably the last we’ll ever see of Evil Morty, and knowing how the show operates, it will probably be a long, long time until we see the consequences of the multiverse cracking open.  But something seems to have changed in the dynamic between Rick and Morty. Maybe Morty will be able to command a little more respect from his grandfather, now that Evil Morty managed to outwit him, while our Morty chose to stay loyal.  Or maybe that toxic relationship is going to stay exactly the same, remaining just as hilariously dysfunctional, for another hundred years of Rick and Morty.  After all, where would the show be without it?

"Woody Harrelson in 'Venom Let There Be Carnage' In a clear sign that Shang-Chi’s $90 million Fri-Mon Labor Day weekend debut was “good enough for Hollywood,” Sony has just announced that they will be moving Venom: Let There Be Carnage. But wait, don’t panic (like Sony arguably did)!  Sony indeed arguably panicked after The Suicide Squad stumbled with a $26 million debut last month and pushed the Tom Hardy/Woody Harrelson/Michelle Williams/Naomie Harris superhero sequel from September 24 to October 15. And now, with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tripling the previous Labor Day weekend record, you’re going to see the Andy Serkis-directed and Kelly Marcel-written Venom flick in theaters not on October 15 but on October 1.  Yup, just as Sony “reacted” to the better-than-hoped performances of Godzilla vs. Jerry and Tom & Kong (sorry, not changing that, because, admit it, you’d all watch the hell out of either of those movies) by moving Peter Rabbit: The Runaway up to May (before moving it to July to replace Minions 2 and then back to June), the rock-solid opening of Shang-Chi has resulted in Sony’s own would-be tentpole shifting upwards on the release schedule.  That’s three years to the weekend of the first Venom’s boffo $80 million domestic debut in 2018. It’s also one year to the weekend of when the Venom 2 was supposed to open in 2020. Venom broke out two years ago despite mixed-negative reviews and frankly years of bad buzz, as the project had a long stench of “cinematic universe at all costs” desperation even after Amazing Spider-Man combusted and Peter Parker joined the MCU.  And, honestly, the movie we got isn’t all that great. However, it had a bonkers-bananas Tom Hardy star turn that was part Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and part Chris Klein in Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, a refreshingly stand-alone sensibility and it got better as it went along, ending with the film fully embracing not the grimdark ethos but rather a genuine camp sensibility.  And even with a darker, scarier villain in Carnage, that seems to be how Venom 2 is being sold. I won’t pretend that Venom: Let There Be Carnage was a sure thing to match Venom’s $214 million domestic, $269 million Chinese and $854 million global totals even in a non-Covid timeline. While folks did like the first film (so I’m not worried about a Tomb Raider Trap) and the marketing for this one has been aces (my kids are psyched), there was/is a danger of the whole “folks were only curious the first time” variable.  And with Covid, climate change and everything else at play, we could still see a scenario where Venom 2 “only” earns about as much worldwide (say, $350-$450 million) as we all thought Venom would three years ago. The first film cost $90 million, so if this one didn’t break the bank than that would still be okay. As far as release date musical chairs, this means that I guess Dune won’t be shifting back to October 1, even with mixed-positive festival buzz/reviews and strong Oscar talk at least in the technical categories. That said, it means that Dune won’t be dealing with a “just came out” Venom sequel while Jackass Forever just fled to February 2022.  Halloween Kills is opening mostly unopposed on October 15, and No Time to Die will have a little competition a little sooner when it opens overseas in late September and in North America on October 8. Oh, and for what it’s worth, it also means that Shang-Chi has one less week to be the only game in town in terms of four-quadrant tentpole thrills, but that’s the price of success. Anyway, that’s the news. Venom: Let There Be Carnage will now open in conventional, PLF and IMAX theaters on October 1. Tickets will go on sale this Wednesday. Maybe, just maybe, the problem with The Suicide Squad and Snake Eyes were, at least commercially speaking, at least partially about The Suicide Squad and Snake Eyes.

"The Miami Dolphins have placed starting left tackle Austin Jackson and tight end Adam Shaheen, who is unvaccinated, on the reserve/Covid-19 list, the team announced Monday, leaving the Dolphins, like several other teams hampered by ill teammates and staff, potentially shorthanded for their season-opening game this Sunday against the Patriots in New England. Adam Shaheen has been outspoken about his opposition to the NFL's efforts to encourage vaccination ... [+] and his refusal to take the shot.  Jackson, the team's first-round draft pick in the 2020 NFL draft, started 12 of the 13 games he played as a rookie and was expected to start Week 1. Shaheen, a backup tight end, has been vocal about his opposition to the league's efforts to encourage vaccination and his refusal to take the shot.  Last month, Shaheen claimed the NFL was ""trying to push"" the vaccine ""on unvaccinated guys."" Shaheen's Twitter bio previously included the phrase, ""Somewhere without a mask,"" and now reads: ""I will not comply."" The NFL Network reported Monday morning that Shaheen tested positive for the virus but has not exhibited ""major symptoms."" In a corresponding roster move, Miami elevated cornerback Jamal Perry as a Covid-19 replacement on Monday. ""They're not going to strong-arm me into doing something for more freedom when this is such a changing atmosphere, and they're already taking away freedoms of the unvaccinated guys,"" Shaheen told reporters in early August. ""I'm going to keep my hands off and follow the rules that they put in place for me, but they're not going to strong-arm myself into getting it."" According to the NFL Network report, it is not yet clear whether Jackson tested positive or landed on the reserve/Covid-19 list due to contact tracing. If Jackson is vaccinated, it's possible he could return from quarantine after five days. If Jackson is unable to Sunday, he will likely be replaced by Greg Little, whom the Dolphins acquired via trade last month. As for Shaheen, because he's unvaccinated, NFL protocols mandate a quarantine period of at least 10 days, meaning he will be unable to play Week 1 in New England. Under the NFL's new protocols, teams that experience a Covid-19 outbreak among unvaccinated players will be forced to forfeit any game that can't be rescheduled. The ""burden of the cancellation or delay will fall on the club experiencing the Covid infection,"" commissioner Roger Goodell declared in a memo to the league's 32 clubs. Many pundits have predicted that teams with a high vaccination rate will have a competitive advantage. Last week, Carson Wentz, the Indianapolis Colts' starting quarterback and highest-paid player, confirmed he has not been vaccinated. Wentz told reporters his choice not to get the jab was a ""personal decision"" and would not ""go in depth on why"" he made it. Darius Leonard, an All-Pro linebacker whom the Colts inked to a record-setting five-year, $98.5 million contract extension last month, revealed he is unvaccinated as well. Leonard explained that he had yet to receive his shot because he was concerned about potential ""long-term effects and stuff like that."" On Sunday, the Dallas Cowboys announced that Zack Martin, a six-time Pro Bowl right guard, tested positive for the coronavirus and would not be able to play in the Cowboys season opener on Thursday. ESPN reporter Chris Mortensen tweeted Monday that several NFL coaches and executives are “nervous about Covid-19 testing today with the number of players who visited their former college teams’ opening games (and social gatherings) this past weekend.” NFL league officials have said they would welcome a vaccine mandate for players.  In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times over the weekend, legendary quarterback Tom Brady revealed that he tested positive for Covid-19 in February, shortly after the Buccaneers parade commemorating their Super Bowl victory. Both of Brady's parents tested positive as well. Brady stated in the interview that the coronavirus could be even more of a challenge during the upcoming season. ""I actually think it's going to play more of a factor this year than last year, just because of the way what we're doing now and what the stadium is going to look like and what the travel is going to look like and the people in the building and the fans,"" he said.  93%. That's the percentage of NFL players that have been vaccinated, according to NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills.

"Is highway hypnosis a real thing and what about those AI self-driving cars? You are driving along on a lengthy stretch of an open highway. Gloriously, you seem to have the roadway entirely to yourself. For miles on end, you haven’t encountered any traffic. This is a relief in comparison to the daily commute that you undertake each day when going to work in a busy downtown city area.  Now, it is just you and the expansive highway. The overall scenery on this highway is admittedly a bit drab. Nothing much to see. There aren’t any flashy billboards or other eye-catching hallmarks. About the only manmade item is the laid-down asphalt of the highway and the painted roadway lines that seem to extend to the furthest horizon.  You begin to find yourself becoming somewhat preoccupied with the lines and lane markers of the highway. For driving purposes, you are merely having to keep your car within the lines of your lane. Your right foot is pressing down on the accelerator pedal with a constant amount of force and you are maintaining a consistent speed. Your hands are securely and fully on the steering wheel, occasionally making microscopic adjustments to ensure that the vehicle remains stridently going straight ahead on this everlasting straightaway. Occasional bumps arise from having the tires go over a rough patch on the highway, providing an almost welcome respite from the otherwise tedium and boredom of this driving trek. When those gruff spots occur, it kind of sparks you to remember that you are driving a car. Indeed, you are driving a car at speeds exceeding 65 miles per hour and are hurdling along at a pace that doesn’t seem fast to you, but if anyone was standing by the roadside you would zoom right past them (for my coverage about the relative nature of speed perception when driving a car, see the link here). The good news is that you are wide awake and had several cups of coffee before you got onto the highway.  You know that being sleepy while driving is a highly dangerous act. That is definitely not going to happen to you. You loathe people that try to drive while drowsy. Of course, it goes without saying that you have even worse opinions about those that try to drink and drive. As the monotony of the driving journey starts to grab up your mind, you almost feel as though you are no longer occupying your body. It is as though your body, essentially your legs and arms, are working without you having to put any conscious thought into the matter. Your mind is floating away from the matters underway, meanwhile, your body and limbs are doing the right thing by staying glued to the driving controls. The driving is so mesmerizing that you begin to lose a sense of time. How long have you been driving on this darned road?  The lack of external stimuli such as pedestrians, other cars, bicycle riders, and the like has altered your perception of time and space. You are on a kind of highway treadmill that just seems to be endlessly running the same path over and over again. If someone could see your face, they would probably notice a somewhat expressionless look. Your eyes have that glassy and faraway appearance. Your mind is operating on a sluggish basis and you almost have an emptiness of thought processes. There isn’t anything worthy of devoting any mental contortions toward. The highway is a simple open path that requires no particular mental gymnastics to contend with. What is happening to you during this long and uneventful drive? Highway hypnosis. Yes, you might remember learning in a driver training class about the dangers of highway hypnosis. It used to be that newbie teenage drivers were strictly forewarned about the evils of highway hypnosis. You were told repeatedly to be on the watch for your mind going into a kind of mental trance. This trance could be induced via driving when there are little or no roadway changes or other alluring attractors that keep your head in the game. It is patently obvious that driving in a hectic city environment you are bombarded by stimuli and your mind has to be going at its peak performance (well, we hope so, for your sake and the other nearby drivers). In contrast, driving on a lengthy mountain road, or through an endless desert, or on any prolonged straightaway is oftentimes bereft of any notable visual stimuli. The belief is that you can become somewhat hypnotized by the roadway.  Similar to the movies and TV shows that used to showcase a person being hypnotized by watching a spiraling line that keeps going and going, the same thing is said to affect you when it is a painted line on the highway that appears to go eternally. The quietness inside the car is coupled with the dullness of the external environment, and the next thing that you know this has combined to put your mind into a sort of dulled trance. There is an ongoing heated debate about the nature of highway hypnosis. Does it occur? Is it a made-up excuse? What causes it? Some trace the origins of the discovery of highway hypnosis to the early days of driving and the initial formulations of automobiles. There are historical accounts that suggest the matter was originally coined as road hypnotism, which eventually was renamed highway hypnosis. The highway hypnosis moniker certainly is a catchier phrasing and seems to readily roll off the tongue. Some experts do not like the catchphrase since it incorporates the notion of hypnotism into it. For various reasons, the mentioning of being hypnotized or being the subject of hypnotism is considered misleading and potentially outright misapplied. The preferred phrasing is something akin to saying that this is a phenomenon consisting of Driving Without Awareness (DWA). Stating that this is driving without awareness is indubitably a more reasoned way to depict the situation, but the popularity and tangy beat of exhorting about the ominous soul-sapping of highway hypnosis is pretty hard to dislodge from the public vocabulary on this intriguing topic. For sake of discussion, please allow me to continue to use the reference of highway hypnosis, and I do so with a proper head nod and apologies to those that vehemently prefer the DWA mantra. Regardless of the naming, the overall facet is that you mentally seem to fade away from the driving task at hand.  This can create a mental time gap, whereby you cannot immediately remember how long you have been at the wheel. You likely cannot recall what you’ve seen so far while being there in the driver’s seat. It is as though your brain is no longer recording whatever you are seeing. In one ear, out the other, in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek homage to the sage piece of wisdom about how we sometimes skip the act of mental processing. People that claim to have been entranced by highway hypnosis will often insist that this did not affect whatsoever on their driving. They reluctantly agree that they might have mentally been in a tropical paradise for a few moments, but assuredly they still were driving the car. They did not remove their hands from the wheel. They did not remove their foot from the pedals. One distinction that some take toward the immersion into highway hypnosis is that it is not the same as the mental act of driving while distracted.  A distracted driver is fully cognizant of the driving task but has switched their mental attention to something other than the driving. For example, a driver might be watching a fascinating cat video via their in-car display, which is causing their mental attention to be split between the roadway and those cute kittens that are playing with a ball of string in that endearing video.  The person driving is still mentally alert. The bad news is that they are giving short shrift to the driving task. At one moment, they are looking and thinking about the highway. The next moment, they are glancing at the cat video or repositioning the mental energies toward the cat video. This kind of mental shifting is playing out like a vigorous ping pong match. The really bad news is that if something goes awry on the highway, their attention might at that instant be on the distracting aspect, such as the cat video, and therefore they are caught utterly unawares of the impending and possibly dire driving situation. In contrast, the purist viewpoint about highway hypnosis is that you are not distracted by anything and that you are in fact devoted to the driving task. The problem is that you are mentally disengaged from the driving task. Some would argue that they are using their subconscious to do the driving, rather than their conscious mind per se (this is open to debate). It is as though your mind has seemingly gone into a mindless state. The barebones fundamental operation of your body and about driving the car is still occurring. This is almost happening by so-called muscle memory. It is reflexive. Your mind is not necessarily thinking about other matters. One might liken this mental condition to being in the midst of some hefty meditation and you have zoned out of the driving chore. The difficulty too is that your mind might not be telling you that you are immersed in this trance. If you were watching a cat video, your mind might be nagging you that you are not paying attention to the roadway. You override that nagging. Despite the overriding, at least the nagging is taking place. A claimed issue for highway hypnosis is that your mind lets itself go free and doesn’t kick you in the mental butt about being more responsible to devote attention to the roadway. Some try to argue that a lousy form of mental engagement is better than the lack of mental engagement regarding the driving task. In that sense, they would assert that driving while distracted is better than getting into the driving hypnotic state of mind. Others would counterargue that highway hypnosis is less threatening than the distracted driver.  We can add more fuel to the fire by including the drunk driver. Presumably, a drunk driver has a mental state that is totally messed up and unable to process properly the world around them. Almost everyone would likely tend to agree that a drunk driver poses a much greater threat than a distracted driver or a highway hypnotized driver. These comparisons though are problematic since there are varying degrees of each kind of mental overtaking. Let’s agree to something that we can all seemingly concur with, namely that driving ought to be a task that has the devoted and undivided attention of a fully cognizant and expressly unencumbered mind of the human driver at the wheel. Period, full stop. Arguing over which of the corrupted mental states is better or worse is akin to the famous saying that this is tantamount to trying to move around the chairs on the deck of the Titanic. Now that I’ve dragged you through the morass about highway hypnosis, one aspect that might have come to your mind is that this driving without awareness is not worthy of discussion since the person is still at the wheel and presumably driving the car. In essence, there is the classic “so what” that needs to be addressed. Why does this all matter? Because a person that is embraced by highway hypnosis, if there is such a thing, can become dull in their driving and ergo have a delayed and potentially life-ending reaction to a sudden roadway mishap. Take for example that while on that long stretch of highway there is a sharp piece of piercing metal that perchance is laying on the roadway (ominously awaiting your tires). It is not immediately obvious to the eye. The size, shape, and color allow it to blend into the overall appearance of the highway surface. A driver that is engulfed in highway hypnosis might have a delayed and incorrect reaction to striking that tire ripping piece of debris. Whereas a driver that was mentally engaged might react with some surprise and concern, they would at least be likely aware that they must have struck something that was on the highway surface. Their mental processing would lead them in that mental calculation, very quickly. And, as such, they would react with a pre-canned mental template that tells them to gradually slow down the car and try to safely pull off the highway. Someone that was zoned out via highway hypnosis would presumably be shocked back into awareness by the sounds and sudden response of the vehicle. This would get them back into the game. But their mind might be at wits end about what just happened. Did they hit something? Did the car itself fall apart or have some egregious problem? They won’t likely be able to recall where the car was before the incident. Did they miss something about the roadway? Their mind might begin to play tricks on them. Perhaps a deer entered into the highway and they were so zoned out mentally that they didn’t even see it. The deer was somehow invisible to their mind. At this juncture, the suddenly re-engaged mind might prod the driver to do something entirely inappropriate for the situation. This could be due to the mind not having a clue about what has just taken place. As a result, some semi-random choice of emergency driving action comes to the forefront of their thinking. This can make a bad situation turn into a deathly one. Various claimed documented cases of drivers in car accidents that said they had highway hypnosis are at times seemingly reinforced by the forensic evidence at the scene of a crash. This might include the fact that no skid marks were indicated on the highway. Had the driver been aware and mentally engaged, the assumption is that they would have immediately hit their brakes and therefore there would be skid marks. You have to be careful when trying to employ roadway evidence to support a contention that highway hypnosis was the culprit. There is usually a multitude of viable explanations. The tie between what the roadway evidence showcases and the true mental state of the driver are somewhat tenuous and altogether usually quite speculative. There has been an off-and-on spate of scholarly research about highway hypnosis. One focus of the inquiry is that perhaps the biomechanics of the eyes is a contributor to the road hypnotic trance. It could be that the non-movement (or minimal movement) of the eyes are generating signals to the brain that somewhat lead to the brain going into this trance zone.  The research remains ongoing and continues to seek a better understanding of what makes driving without awareness (i.e., highway hypnosis) occur and how to resolve it. Harking back to the days of learning about highway hypnosis while in driver training, you might recall that there were several pieces of handy advice about how to try and avert this seemingly temporary and possibly deadly mental condition. One proffered action entails moving your eyes back and forth to scan the roadway. This might seem to keep your eyes engaged and correspondingly your mind engaged.  More pieces of advice include creating your own engaging stimuli. Turn on the radio and listen to something that keeps your mind active. Chew gum. Open a window of the car to get wind whisking into the interior. These are all potential ways to keep highway hypnosis at bay. That being said, there is a fine line between seeking to remain mentally engaged and yet pushing you over into the distracted driving mode. Let’s slightly shift gears. The future of cars consists of AI-based true self-driving cars. There isn’t a human driver involved in a true self-driving car. Keep in mind that true self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle. For my extensive and ongoing coverage of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and especially self-driving cars, see the link here. Here’s an intriguing question that is worth pondering: Is it conceivable that AI-based true self-driving cars might somehow suffer from highway hypnosis, and if so, what can be done about this? I’d like to first further clarify what is meant when I refer to true self-driving cars. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.  These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.  Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.  You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. Self-Driving Cars And Highway Hypnosis For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.  Why is this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient? Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet. With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car. Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic. First, consider what could happen if a self-driving encountered a human-driven car that was being driven by someone that had succumbed to a presumed dose of highway hypnosis.  The concern in this scenario is that the human driver might not adequately react to a roadway anomaly. Furthermore, the driver might inadvertently do something untoward during any ordinary driving task because they are mentally zoned out. There’s not particularly anything extraordinary that the self-driving car can do about such a circumstance.  Allow me to explain. By and large, there are no outwardly evidentiary means to ferret out whether a human driver is driving with a full semblance of mental alertness versus whether they are in an alleged mental trance. About the only clues would be that the conventional human-driven car in question might seem to be driving without any apparent reaction to the roadway status. For example, suppose the AI driving system detects via the self-driving car sensors that there is a large boulder in the roadway up ahead. The AI driving system might begin slowing down the self-driving car, anticipating the need to come to a stop before reaching the boulder. Meanwhile, imagine that the human-driven car nearby and traveling along at a tad ahead of the self-driving car seems to be making no overt indications of slowing or intending to stop. This could be an indicator that the human driver of that car is incurring highway hypnosis.  Of course, it could be that the driver is distracted by watching enchanting online videos of a baby gurgling and fussing while eating some scrumptious baby food. Or the driver might be drunk and just barely able to keep the car moving forward and has not yet realized that the boulder is going to be a problem. And so on. Since any of those are real possibilities, there are no immediate means to assume that the human driver is consumed necessarily by highway hypnosis. The AI driving system could either merely wait and see what happens to the conventional car or might take some proactive action to try and alert the human driver. For example, suppose the AI driving system opts to honk the horn of the self-driving car or perhaps turns the headlights on and off, attempting to gain the attention of the human driver. This takes us to a brief but valuable side tangent. Most people assume that AI driving systems are being programmed to focus exclusively on the well-being of the self-driving car. That could be the case. As such, the AI would not be exploring any concerns that are bereft of any specific bearing on the outcome of efforts entailing the self-driving car per se. If the crashing of the human-driven car into the boulder would not have any distinct impact upon the self-driving car, there would presumably be no cause for the AI driving system to do anything about the predicted catastrophe. This is a somewhat vexing and ethically open question about whether we would expect or want self-driving cars to go further and try to assist other traffic, such as nearby human-driven cars. I’ve discussed this matter at the link here. We would likely expect that other nearby human drivers would attempt to act in a good Samaritan fashion, and as such we might hope to have self-driving cars do likewise (as programmed by the AI developers to do so, not because the AI “divines” to do so). In any case, there isn’t much more to be fruitfully said about the use case of a human driver in the hypnotic highway haze and the overarching role of a nearby self-driving car. Generally, the AI driving system needs to be observing other nearby cars always and the AI programming needs to try and anticipate what those other cars are going to do, especially when those actions pertain to the driving of the self-driving car. Moving on, we get the crux of this matter. If you believe that there is such a thing as highway hypnosis and that it can overtake the mental acumen of human drivers, we can give some consideration to the curious possibility that AI driving systems might suffer the same potential fate. I’d like to emphasize that one big problem with trying to make such a claim or connection is that it tends to imply that the AI driving system is sentient.  As mentioned earlier, none of today’s AI driving systems are sentient. I would also easily win a wager that we won’t have such AI in any near-term future and unlikely in any later-term future. I am not asserting that we will never have sentient AI, which some would argue is in fact never going to happen. I’ll settle for now on the simpler notion that sentient AI is not in the cards for the foreseeable future.  Let’s leave things at that for the moment. Okay, if the AI isn’t sentient, we would seem on the safe theoretical ground to proclaim that the AI driving system will decidedly not become a victim of highway hypnosis.  You see, we can be clear-cut about the undeniable aspect that the AI driving system does not have eyeballs (not now). It has video cameras and other sensors such as radar, LIDAR, and the like, but it doesn’t have human eyes. Plus, AI does not have a brain. AI of today has various computer processors and other electronic circuitry, which is assuredly not a brain and should not be falsely compared to a human brain. Here’s why that is significant. For those that are sticklers about the meaning of highway hypnosis, they would fervently say that to experience highway hypnosis you must have human eyes, a human brain, and your eyes and brain are the elements that would become ostensibly hypnotized by the highway driving. We’ve just stated that AI driving systems aren’t composed in that manner and therefore strictly speaking could not be labeled as susceptible to highway hypnosis. Case closed. Wait for a second, let’s be a bit more flexible about this. If you are willing to agree that highway hypnosis is more so about driving without awareness, and if we are willing to also define awareness in a more logically pliable fashion (even in the absence of sentience), we can constructively take a gander at seeing how this all applies to self-driving cars. Shall we do so? Sure! Imagine that a self-driving car is driving down a deserted highway. There aren’t any other cars. There isn’t anything to speak of, just lots of wide-open terrain that is relatively nondescript and unremarkable. The AI driving system is programmed to keep track of objects that are in the nearby driving scene. An internal list is being kept by the program. A software developer established the list such that it can contain up to a thousand detected objects at any point in time. Once an object is first detected, it is added to the list. When the object is no longer detectable, such as having passed a car that is now far behind the self-driving car and no longer within visual distance, the object is removed from the list. Turns out, for every defined snippet of time, if there aren’t any detected objects, the program places a marker of “nothing detected” into the list. The programmer never envisioned a scenario in which the self-driving car would be bereft of nearby objects for any substantive length of time. This seemed unimaginable, especially since the AI driving system was initially devised to handle inner-city driving.  Unfortunately, this is where things go awry on the monotonous long drive. After several hours of this mundane driving, the object list ends up with a thousand posted instances of “nothing detected” and the list now generates a buffer overflow error. But the rest of the AI system has no provision for dealing with the buffer overflow since it was not anticipated as a possibility. The net result is that the AI driving system is still driving the self-driving car, but it no longer is actively tracking detected objects. Until a new object is detected, which will then cause a flush of the now exceeded list, the software is essentially in a “trance” and seemingly zoned out. In short, the program code has regrettably fallen into the likes of a type of highway hypnosis due to a bug or error that resides in the AI driving system. Conclusion Some smarmy AI developers might insist that this notion of such a bug or error being in the AI driving system code is utterly impossible and would never occur.  If you really think that, it is a bit unnerving. I’d strongly suggest that those of you having such a dogmatic faith in the purity of development for real-time systems as being altogether perfect and absent of any gotchas ought to see my analysis of the recent snafu in the code used for the NASA Mars helicopter known as Ingenuity, see the link here. As an eye-opener for those that don’t realize it, there are going to be bugs and errors in AI driving systems, despite whatever some pundits or vendors might say.  Sorry to burst your bubble. Though testing and simulation can do a lot to find them beforehand, there is nonetheless a bona fide and an altogether likely chance that some will still exist inside fielded self-driving cars. The key will be how good the error handling and contingency provisions are in the AI driving system to cope when those bugs rise up and do their roguish handiwork. Back to the matter of highway hypnosis. I would not want anyone to go around and assert categorically that AI-based self-driving cars are going to have highway hypnosis. Doing so is a slippery slope toward anthropomorphizing AI. Let’s just say that there are possibilities of AI driving systems to get into untoward states of processing, for which we could characterize this as somewhat akin to driving without the proper devoted and active attention to the driving task. And whatever you do, please stay in the proper mental zone when driving and make sure to heave-ho any taint of harmfully hideous highway hulking hypnosis.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2021/09/06/could-that-dreaded-highway-hypnosis-that-puts-human-drivers-into-a-trance-befall-ai-self-driving-cars/,Could That Dreaded Highway Hypnosis That Puts Human Drivers Into A Trance Befall AI Self-Driving Cars?

All Rights Reserved. As of this posting, Marvel and Disney’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) has logged a $71 million Fri-Sun/$83.5 million Fri-Mon holiday debut (update: it’s actually $75.5 million/$90 million, since, as expected, Disney underestimated yesterday). That’s obviously the biggest Labor Day weekend launch ever. Heck, it’s almost, almost triple the unadjusted $30.5 million Fri-Mon debut of Rob Zombie’s Halloween in 2007. Even if it is only as leggy as Halloween ($58 million/$30 million) or Jason Statham’s Transporter 2 ($43.5 million from a $20 million Fri-Mon debut in 2005), it’s looking at a domestic cume between $171 million and $195 million.  And with strong buzz, solid reviews, Disney’s run of leggy theatrical releases in 2021 (Raya and the Last Dragon through Free Guy) and a lack of tentpole competition until No Time to Die on October 8, well, even legs like Pierce Brosnan’s The November Man ($25 million/$10 million in 2014) gets it to $225 million domestic. So, with the disclaimer that some of this will be painfully obvious, let’s take a quick gander at the variables and factors that played into this summer-ending triumph. Without further ado... The MCU franchise is the biggest, safest and most trusted brand in theatrical filmmaking. It’s coming to a point where consumers essentially get all of their genre needs from Marvel movies (and at least some DC comic book superhero flicks). That ends up being to Marvel and DC’s advantage when general audiences look at Shang-Chi or DC’s Joker as unlike anything they’ve ever seen in theaters because they don’t consume much non-franchise films/television shows. But I digress. Marvel has been, at least since Guardians of the Galaxy in August 2014, the biggest “movie star” in town. Most North American audiences have never heard of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu, don’t watch Kim’s Convenience and didn’t spend the pandemic binging Lust Caution, The Grandmaster and the five-hour cut of Red Cliff. However, they will show up because they trust the MCU to deliver IMAX-friendly, four-quadrant, character-focused three-to-four star popcorn thrills.  The main trailers for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings were... not that great. I’d also say the same thing about the pre-release marketing for Thor, The Avengers and Captain Marvel. However, Disney knew the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed movie worked like gangbusters, so they screened it early and let the review embargo drop in late-August. It currently has a 92% fresh and 7.6/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, with the reviews assuring folks that A) the action was well-staged and coherently edited, B) Simu Liu was a charismatic new MCU lead who didn’t quite let Tony Leung steal the entire film out from under him and C) there were plenty of not-in-the-trailer goodies both in terms of narrative twists and unexpected visual delights. Oh, and the notices assured folks that they could take their kids as long as their kids were old enough to read subtitles.  As noted above, the two main theatrical trailers were pretty mediocre. However, as you know if you’ve seen the film, there are many character beats, action set pieces, plot twists and visual reveals which are barely hinted at in the marketing. That’s obviously a very dangerous game, but it’s one that can pay off in spades if audiences show up anyway. As we saw with the likes of Free Guy, Hancock, Knives Out, Frozen and The Dark Knight, you don’t have to give away the whole movie if you trust audiences to show up anyway. And if they do show up, the unspoiled surprises will increase the positivity of the buzz and create a sense of ownership among audiences, resulting in often very long legs. Even my kids remarked, unprompted, that Shang-Chi was much better than the trailers. That’s good, because they hated the Eternals preview. It’s not a zero sum game, but having at least something approximating a theatrical window does boost overall global box office. Save for The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, most of Warner Bros.’ post-Godzilla Vs. Kong offerings struggled theatrically while being concurrently available (for the first 31 days) on HBO Max. Black Widow did okay in North America ($183 million), but its concurrent “available to lease on Disney+ for $30” release was a major factor in the the poor 2x weekend multiplier, the sharp 69% second-weekend drop and overall frontloaded-for-Marvel (a 2.3x multiplier from an $80 million domestic debut) theatrical run. Conversely, Wrath of Man topped $103 million worldwide (huge for a solo Jason Statham actioner), A Quiet Place part II earned 90% of its predecessor’s $341 million global cume and Free Guy is racing toward $300 million on an over/under $115 million budget. So, yeah, making theaters the only place to see Shang-Chi for the first 45 days was absolutely crucial for this business-as-usual debut. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is more evidence that diversity is a big added-value element in films audiences already want to see. The Simu Liu/Awkwafina/Tony Leung/Michelle Yeoh action fantasy was the first Asian-centric Marvel movie was a big deal. “Marvel movie” was, alas, more important than “Asian-centric.” Snake Eyes (starring Henry Golding and Andrew Koji) bombed six weeks ago, while In the Heights was not “the movie we need right now.” Without being a total Debbie Downer on this (I still wish folks who saw Black Panther five times maybe only saw it four times and sampled A Wrinkle in Time, Gringo, Annihilation and/or Pacific Rim: Uprising as well), Marvel’s Phase Four plan to highlight more “not a white guy” protagonists helps maintain the event movie nature of these newbie origin stories in a world where merely being a superhero movie is no longer special.  To paraphrase Ratatouille, not every movie can be a blockbuster, but a blockbuster can open anywhere. That’s one key lesson, as Disney was somewhat forced by the pandemic to schedule one of their more promising “new” MCU movies on what traditionally has been the deadest of dead holiday weekends. All due respect to Chris Nolan’s Tenet (being a hero means you tried, even if you failed), but this weekend has traditionally been marked by studio dumps, reissues of popular favorites, grindhouse openers (Halloween, Transporter 2, Gamer, etc.) and adult-skewing, star-driven thrillers (The American, The Constant Gardener, The Debt, etc.) for which a $15 million four-day debut would be an unmitigated triumph. But as Warner Bros. showed with It in early September 2017, and as Universal showed with Fast & Furious 6 in early April 2009, a top-tier tentpole can open anywhere as long as audiences wanted to see it.

"Bolgheri cypress trees on Viale dei Cipressi Consider hosting a dinner for a thousand guests who will sit at a half-mile long row of outdoor tables before eating four courses and drinking from a list of 120 different wines. Without roofing or umbrellas available—clear weather is essential. As they prepared for this massive dinner this past Saturday in Tuscany, Italy, the organizers from the Bolgheri wine consortium were acutely aware of this. It was not a sure thing.  Two days before the dinner, the weather forecast included rain. Perhaps the Etruscan deity Fufluns—god of wine and happiness—intervened, because the forecast suddenly switched. Sunshine blazed on Saturday, while the evening stayed generally clear with deliciously ambient temperatures.  Near the western coast of Tuscany, close to the Mediterranean Sea, this Cena di Gala—gala dinner—was served at tables lining the iconic and temporarily closed road known as Viale dei Cipressi—Cyprus Avenue. This route is flanked by decades-old, beautiful and bushy cypress trees and links the village of Bolgheri to San Guido, where this viale then intersects a perpendicular north-south road—Via Vecchia Aurelia—that runs parallel to the Tyrrhenian Sea. Cena di Gala on Viale di Cipressi in Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy Guests wearing jackets and heels arrived at 8:00 p.m. via cars and shuttle buses, then sat at individually designated seats at sumptuous tables lined with vine leaves and punctuated with massive floral arrays. After guests sipped aperitivi, the sun sank, table candles flickered, wine and food were served, background music pulsed from interspersed amplifiers and colored lights illuminated cypress trees in the background. Perfetto. This huge and beautifully coordinated dinner was organized by the Bolgheri wine consortium, or Consorzio per la Tutela dei Vini DOC Bolgheri e DOC Bolgheri Sassicaia. Founded in 1995, the consortium promotes, protects and manages Bolgheri wine appellations. Its board is comprised of representatives associated with iconic Italian wines—including Antinori, Ornellaia e Masseto, Tenuta San Guido and Le Macchiole. It represents 60 producers who grow vines on 3,385 acres, or 13 square miles (1,370 hectares, or 34 square kilometers) of land within the appellations of Bolgheri. Dinner included dishes even picky diners would describe as delicious: Tuscan tomato purée with Marzolino sheep cheese and basil, pasta gemelli with white meat and rosemary ragout, pork tenderloin with juniper berries and julienned veggies, and vanilla ice cream with raspberries and almond crumble. Dishes were paired with wines from four denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions within Bolgheri: Vermentino/Bianco, Rosato, Rosso, and Superiore and Sassacaia. Dinner for 1,000 in Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy This second iteration of the gala (the first was held in 2019 for a ‘mere’ 750 guests to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the DOC consortium) was a celebration of wine and camaraderie by Bolgheri winemakers. This subset of Tuscan vignerons burst onto the scene in the 1970’s when they showcased wines made not form Italian varieties such as Sangiovese, but from French Bordeaux and Rhone varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. A host’s amplified voice explained, first in Italian and then English, that this year’s dinner was intended as ‘a symbol of our consortium and of Italian quality.’ She also introduced the event as the first effective ‘primeurs’ wine tasting for the Bolgheri region, as well as a celebration of the overall ‘elegance and intensity’ of the 2020 vintage. The rise of Bolgheri’s prestige is linked with the rise of Sassicaia, which gained worldwide attention in the 1970’s after producing quality wine using Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc—grape varieties associated with Bordeaux in France, rather than with Italian varieties such as Sangiovese. Word spread, vineyards began to proliferate in the region and eventually large investments in vine tracts began pouring into the plains and hills surrounding the village of Bolgheri during the late 90’s. Dinner for 1,000 in Bolgheri, Tuscany Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot now dominate the plantings in Bolgheri, followed by Petit Verdot, Syrah and Sangiovese. For white wines—the predominant varieties are Vermentino, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. At this linear row of long tables, diners began drinking white wines (such as L’Iracondo Vermentino from Podere Sette), then moved onto reds (such as Guidalberto from Tenuta San Guido—a silky and integrated beauty with seductive spice and red fruit) or a Caravèra from Podere dei Musi.

"Bolgheri, Tuscany Eugenio Campolmi grew up surrounded by his parents’ work life at the restaurant they owned—named Le Macchiole—located on coastal western Tuscany near the village of Bolgheri. Yet he realized that he lacked interest in running a restaurant, and wanted instead to make wine. At this time, in the early 1980’s, most wines from this region were not renowned, and working in agriculture was viewed as rarely stable and hardly lucrative. When Eugenio told his parents that he wanted to leave their restaurant and instead grow grapes to make wine, they were horrified. ‘It was a disaster,’ explained his wife Cinzia Merli (Eugenio passed away in 2002). ‘His parents did not agree, because viticulture was not so big at the time. When he said he wanted to make wine, his parents asked me to convince him otherwise, but my own parents were farmers.’ Cinzia Merli (center) with sons Elia (left) and Mattia (right) In 1983, Campolmi bought 10 acres (four hectares) of vines. The Bolgheri region was not well known for wines at that time, aside from a few producers such as Sassicaia, which was then gaining international attention. Eugenio tried growing Sangiovese and Barbera, both respected grape varieties throughout northern Italy—even staples for the Tuscan and Piedmont regions. Local climate and soil types, however, did not favor either. The terroir was basked in sunlight while regional soils form a unique combination of alluvial and marine sediments. The conditions were more conducive to growing grapes more common to France than Italy. ‘He found that Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc were great here. Also Merlot,’ explained Mattia—one of two sons of Eugenio and Cinzia. ‘He made the Paleo Rosso blend first with Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. But in 1993 he began adding Cabernet Franc, and by 2001 made Paleo with 100% Cabernet Franc. He was the first wine producer in Bolgheri to make a single variety Cabernet Franc.’ (Paleo is the name of a local coastal wild herb.) Vineyard in Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy From the beginning, clients of Le Macchiole were largely international. Cinzia explained why. ‘When we started making wine, Italians did not care about this area. There were only a few wine shops that sold Bolgheri wines—in Tuscany as well as in Rome and Milan. ‘First, we sold mostly to Great Britain, then to Belgium, Japan and the U.S.’ Today, the biggest market for Le Macchiole wines is Italy—followed by Switzerland, the U.S. and Japan.  Le Macchiole’s Messorio wine is also a single variety—100% Merlot. Le Macchiole was also the first regional producer to make a 100% Syrah—named Scrio. Their Bolgheri Rosso is a Bordeaux blend of Merlot, Cabernet France and Cabernet Sauvignon and also includes the French Rhone variety of Syrah. These grapes fared so well under local conditions that by 2009, Le Macchiole had removed all Sangiovese from their vineyards. Cinzia (who is also vice president of the consortium that manages Bolgheri’s wine appellations) appreciates the challenges of Syrah. ‘To produce Syrah is very hard. We began in 1994 and my husband was very passionate. It’s hard because the soils here are too rich for Syrah. But we found perfect soils on a hill in Casavecchia at 200 meters [600 feet] above sea level. Those wines have more finesse. Other plots around here produce Syrah with more density and concentration. ‘Syrah was my husband’s favorite grape variety. He had a dream to produce a Syrah with the elegance and finesse of that from France and the power of a Syrah from Australia.’ Barrel cellar at Le Macchiole One reason why Cinzia and her sons adopted organic practices is because her husband passed away from cancer in 2002—possibly related to the use of agricultural chemicals. During that time tractor cabs were open, and drivers worked unprotected—constantly inhaling chemicals they sprayed on vines.  ‘We now use different techniques to manage vines,’ explained Cinzia’s son Elia. ‘To work in vines you need to stay safe and healthy. Working organically also keeps the vines healthier.’ Today Le Macchiole grows vines on 69 acres (28 hectares) of terrain. Their various plots are splattered in different prime locations to the north, south, east and west of the village of Bolgheri and include compellingly sonorous names such as Casanuova, Vignone, Lamentano, Sommi, Ulivino and Livrone. They are also experimenting with bordering some plots (in addition to fences which keep out wild boars) with different local species of trees and vegetation. Elia explained. ‘We use different kinds of plants as a natural shield against parasites. Some plants attract pests away from vines, and some plants draw beneficial insects into vines.’ Each year Cinzia and her two sons work together with the boys’ uncle and their winemaker Luca Rettondini to select blends for both Paleo Rosso and Paleo Bianco wines. ‘It’s a round table,’ Mattia explained. ‘Everyone gives ideas and we decide together on which path to follow. It’s really cool. I think it’s one of the best moments of the year.’ Local cinghiale wild boar at Osteria San Guido, near Bolgheri Winemaker Rettondini has worked in Italy’s Chianti region as well as in Australia and in Bordeaux, France. He explained why their wines have distinctively clean and bright aromas and tastes. ‘We spent a lot of time and energy studying the three grapes used to make single variety wines. We found it was best to use less oak to better explain the terroir. Also, we have studied the soils so when we replant vines, we know what to expect. The pleasure is to drink wine after a lot of years and understand that attention paid in the past has worked. The future is open—the sons of Cinzia are young, but with a lot of energy and big brains. They will respect the past of their father and mother, but will also have new ideas. No rapid changes here at Le Macchiole.’ The family gives back to the community that—since it transformed into a flourishing wine region—has allowed their business to grow and prosper. In celebration of a 100-point score for their 2004 Messorio wine which they received from Wine Spectator, Cinzia commissioned a large canvas painting, then cut it into 48 rectangles and placed each as a label on a six-liter bottle of wine. Proceeds from selling these bottles went into purchasing five metal rectangles that have been placed around the region, so that visitors can frame themselves before scenic vistas for photographs. ‘The idea is to promote Bolgheri,’ Mattia explained. Le Macchiole vines before harvest, Tuscany Viticulturally, Bolgheri is somewhat of a slice of France within Italy. Yet Italian heritage dominates, and local grapes are not forgotten. In recent years Le Macchiole began planting a small amount of Sangiovese again. ‘We tried Sangiovese for a long time,’ Cinzia explained. ‘But the soils are too rich, there is too much sunlight and the influence of the sea is not good for this variety. But recently we again planted a small parcel, which we will use in Bolgheri Rosso.’  The key to Bolgheri’s future, then, may also involve integrating the past. Experimentation is something Eugenio well understood. Tasting Notes. Le Macchiole. Bolgheri Rosso. DOC. 2019. 94 points. This is the only blend produced by Le Macchiole—a 50/20/20/10 of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The aim is to represent the classical flavor of Bolgheri but to make the wine easily approachable. Luscious aromas of red fruit, cocoa, cranberries and a hint of smoke. Soft mouth feel with flavors of black pepper and balsamic and reminiscent—in terms of elevated structure and fruit profile—more of a Napa than a Bordeaux blend. Pair with cinghiale wild boar meat, seared tuna or—according to Cinzia—even with an ombria white fish together with pasta and salsa verde. Annual production 145,000 bottles. Le Macchiole. Paleo Rosso. IGT. 2017. 97 points. This 100% Cabernet Franc ages for 18 months in new oak and includes aromas that will remind you of a Bordeaux Saint-Émilion, while the taste may bring back memories of a Rhone Valley Syrah from France—due to the hot climate influence of the Mediterranean. Gorgeous aromas of blueberries, eucalyptus, Oreo chocolate cookies and sultanas. Lively and fresh in the mouth with a ribbon of beautiful acidity on the finish. Because the wine’s acidity will slice against fat in foods, Cinzia recommends a lamb pairing, while her son Mattia prefers duck. In restaurants in Naples, this wine is often paired with scallops. Left to right - Elia, Cinzia and Mattia of Le Macchiole Le Macchiole. Scrio. IGT. 2017. 96 points. This 100% Syrah is made from grapes taken from two vineyards—planted 22 and 27 years ago. Pronounced, clean and bright aromas include those of cocoa and even ginger and peppermint. A layer cake on the nose. Suavely integrated flavors that are precise and fine and include licorice and chocolate. Rich acidity on the finish—as with all wines from Le Macchiole. Le Macchiole. Messorio. IGT. 2017. 94 points. This 100% Merlot includes luscious Bolgheri aromas of rich fruit, with a hint of balsamic. Similar to a 2018 Bordeaux blend with profoundly deep dark aromas of black fruit. Firm tannins, vibrant acidity and rich fruit flavors. Versatile for pairing—consider lamb and chutney. 10,000 bottles produced annually. Le Macchiole. Paleo Rosso. 2018. 97+ points. Chewy, almost edible Cabernet Franc, with aromas that include sage, chocolate, black cherries, black pepper and chestnuts. Juicy and rounded mouth feel with a slightly wild herbaceous edge. Excellent acidity—which appears to be characteristic for 2018 Bolgheri wines in general. View from Lo Scoglietto Restaurant north of Bolgheri, Tuscany Le Macchiole. Scrio. Syrah. IGT. 2018. 97 to 98 points. Robust aromas of blackberries, black cherries, sage and blueberries. Suave and elegant in the mouth with signature balsamic and a hint of anise. A heftier Syrah than from the 2017 vintage, and with more spice. Beautiful. The realization of Eugenio’s dream of harmonizing French finesse with Australian power. Le Macchiole. Messorio. IGT. 2018. 96 to 97 points. This 100% Merlot includes vibrant and rich aromas that include black pepper, anise and orange rind (Cinzia also detects rosemary). Rounded and emphatic in the mouth, with well-integrated tannins and acidity. Includes character and depth, with a quality level on a par with the 2018 Scrio and 2018 Paleo Rosso. Consider pairing with beef teriyaki. Le Macchiole. Paleo Bianco. 2020. IGT. 95 points. This 80/20 blend of Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc includes fresh and energetic waves of aromas of lime, sage, lavender, mint and salty sea spray. A clean, bright delight. Pair with seafood snacks such as anchovies.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmullen/2021/09/06/le-macchiole-wines-a-sliver-of-france-in-italy/,Le Macchiole Wines—A Sliver Of France In Italy
"The Walking Dead The Walking Dead thankfully avoided the Commonwealth storyline entirely last night, instead focusing on the more interesting “Reaper” plot that was not pulled from the comics, but has created an entirely new faction of enemies to stalk the other half of the group. This has resulted in Maggie’s expedition force being decimated (we already lost a bunch of her “redshirts” from her old camp), but it’s also causing us to have an interesting reckoning with Negan, one that the comics never really did in the same way. Maggie has returned to find that Negan is A) still alive and B) out of jail and C) more or less accepted as a member of the community, despite his past war crimes which include not just the brutal executions of Glenn and Abraham, but a literal war he waged on Alexandria.  This has resulted in Maggie acting like the world has lost its mind to think that Negan has changed, and he’s already starting to prove her suspicions correct, like a recent moment where he chose not to save Maggie from walkers, which easily could have resulted in her death, but she fought them off. His justification was that not saving someone wasn’t the same as killing them, but the message is clear, Negan is out for himself, and he would not mind if Maggie did not make it back from this trip alive, given that she’s a clear and present danger to him. The Walking Dead Maggie frequently says that Negan has “everyone fooled” except her, and I think we’re supposed to be saying “No Maggie, Negan has changed! He’s a complex character that has grown and evolved and helped the community now!” But I don’t buy it, I never have, and I have always felt that Robert Kirkman’s Negan redemption arc was extremely weird, and I am happy to see it kind of being deconstructed here at last. Sure, it’s the murders and the war, in part, but for some reason, the thing that grossed me out the most was always Negan’s “harem” of wives that he has wear little cute outfits and have sex with him on demand, even if they, like Sherry, have husbands in his crew (this also seems like a terrible way to breed loyalty among your lieutenants, as certainly was the case with Dwight). Negan’s justification was always that the women agreed to become his wives and he was never forcing anyone to do anything, and yet in practice, he was blackmailing them with supplies and better treatment, and it was explicitly clear they all hated him, as evidenced by the one episode where they tried to get Eugene help them murder him. It was, in effect, a rape harem. And that is very hard to get past. The Walking Dead I simply don’t think Negan has changed as much as anyone wants to believe. I think he’s been humbled certainly, but everything he does is more or less for his own self-interest. I believe he’s human and capable for forming connections with other people, often kids like Judith or Lydia (and no, I don’t think he’s creeping on them), but his actions? He helped Carol assassinate Alpha as a way to get out of prison and earn at least some measure of trust with the community. But that was a purely self-interested ploy. He could have fully defected to the Whisperers when he had the chance, and yet I think he would have rather lived in Alexandria than with a bunch of weird psychopaths in walker masks, so he chose Rick’s old group not out of genuine concern for them, but because it would be a better set-up for him. Negan is a cockroach, he’s just trying to survive. This season he tried to let Maggie die because there is significantly less of a chance of him being murdered by the vengeful wife of one of his victims if he does. Keep an eye on him, and you’ll see almost everything he does is in fact for his own benefit, and his altruism is circumstantial, at best. In the comics, which I believe is no roadmap forward, Negan eventually just sort of disappears from the story, and we don’t know what happens to him. Kirkman has a sort of weird fascination with Negan in my opinion, allowing him this redemption arc, writing him a big origin story and even theorizing about returning to the character in the future. But the show? I think the show needs to kill Negan before it ends, though I worry instead we’re seeing him set up for his own spin-off series, and this arc will continue forever.

[+] August 29, 2021. - Hurricane Ida struck the coast of Louisiana Sunday as a powerful Category 4 storm, 16 years to the day after deadly Hurricane Katrina devastated the southern US city of New Orleans.""Extremely dangerous Category 4 Hurricane Ida makes landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana,"" the National Hurricane Center wrote in an advisory. (Photo by Mark Felix / AFP) (Photo by MARK FELIX/AFP via Getty Images) Down from the roughly 600,000 without power on Sunday, about 510,000 of Louisiana’s over 2.1 million energy customers were experiencing outages early Monday, according to PowerOutage.US. Power has been largely restored to the western part of the state, but severe blackouts remain in southeastern Louisiana, where 10 parishes have 50% or more of their residents without power.  Six parishes still have nearly all of their residents in the dark—Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. James and St. Helena—and may continue to face widespread outages for weeks more, Entergy Corporation President Philip May said over the weekend.  Though originally expected to take weeks to service, New Orleans has made steady progress with about 52% of its power restored Monday morning.  1.2 million. That’s how many customers originally lost power when the storm hit Louisiana.  “The level of devastation makes it quite difficult or near impossible to get in and fully access some places,” May told The Associated Press, projecting it could take until Sept. 29 for full power restoration from a storm he described as more destructive than hurricanes Katrina, Zeta and Delta combined.  After pummeling Louisiana last week, the Category 4 storm went on to hit the Gulf Coast and Northeast. The death toll across all the areas affected by the storm is at least 62, according to The Wall Street Journal, though the number continues to rise. The extended blackouts have resulted in a slew of carbon monoxide poisoning cases among residents turning to makeshift power sources local officials warn are dangerous. This includes the death of a family of three who set up a generator outside of their home while they were left without power.  “Power Returning To New Orleans Within Days—Not Weeks, Electric Company Says” (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/06/half-a-million-still-without-power-in-louisiana-as-deaths-rise-one-week-after-hurricane-ida/,Half A Million Still Without Power In Louisiana As Deaths Rise One Week After Hurricane Ida
"Rugby World Cup France 2023 Partnership Announcement (Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images) In two years, the 2023 Rugby World Cup will kick-off at the Stade de France in Paris's northern suburbs. It will mark the first staging of the world's third-largest sporting event in France since 2007 and technology will play an unprecedented, critical role in the delivery of the tournament. Fourteen years ago, the tech world was a very different place. The first iPhone had only just hit the shelves, Windows Vista was struggling to find its feet in the market, and two BBC journalists documented their World Cup experience in a campervan on an experimental microblogging site called ‘Twitter’. The way partners work with events has also shifted significantly since then. Relationships are no longer just marketing and service arrangements – they are considered genuinely collaborative partnerships.  True partnership French firm Capgemini will be involved at France 2023, just as it was at France 2007. But back then, it was ‘Official Technology and Consultancy sponsor', and its focus was on the delivery of the official website, IT systems, and statistic platforms. This time round its role will be elevated significantly and is tasked with the digital transformation of both the World Cup and the sport’s global governing body, World Rugby.  The company has signed a three-year deal wand will use data analytics, cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive fan engagement, create new insights for players, coaches, and administrators, and to make operations more efficient. “This partnership is much deeper than a brand association, this is a purpose-driven relationship between our two organizations that share many common values,” declared World Rugby CEO Alan Gilpin.  “It reflects our ambition to keep innovating and deepen our relationship with fans, enriching their experience by embracing new technology and digital platforms. Capgemini is the perfect partner to help us deliver this shared vision.” Capgemini tells me the deal to become ‘Digital Transformation Partner’ was a natural next step in its long involvement with rugby which started with its founder Serge Kampf, who was a lifelong fan of the sport. In addition to being involved at France 2007, Capgemini is a major partner for the Rugby Sevens World Series. CEO Aiman Ezzat admits the lure of being involved with another home tournament was a factor in the partnership. But he also stresses that rugby’s increasingly global profile was also attractive – as was the opportunity to showcase the technological advances since the last World Cup in France.  “We’re basically the main sponsor of the transformation element of rugby’s global events,” he tells me. “Rugby represents our values in terms of teamwork and innovation, and we are in most of the markets where rugby is a major sport. “We are a global company but also French. [Rugby World Cup] 2007 was significant for us and technology can deliver a lot more than 14 years ago and it’s important for us to show that.” This picture shows a general view of the Stade de France Stadium during the rugby union World Cup ...

AFP PHOTO / FRANCK FIFE (Photo credit should read FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images) Digital advances The Rugby World Cup will provide a major global showcase for Capgemini’s wares, which in turn will look to drive engagement for the organizers. Many of the products deployed in the Rugby Sevens series will be redeployed for the 15-a-side version of the sport. “We are just at the start,” Rory Burghes, VP, Accelerated Solutions Environment at Capgemini tells me. “Japan showed we could grow the fanbase in a non-traditional region. Our challenge is to provide existing fans with additional insight and explain concepts to new fans.” Burghes cites the example of the 'momentum tracker' as one such example of how a digital service can help achieve these goals. Rather than focus on points, wins and losses to explain the action, the momentum tracker crunches various data points to identify other ways the team is making improvements. This means that a fan of a country that isn't winning can gain an idea of how the team is progressing and can become more invested in its fortunes. An example of the tracker at work is the Ireland national Rugby Sevens side. The country is a powerhouse in the 15-a-side game bit is a relative newcomer to Sevens.  The momentum tracker was able to identify how the team's improved performance at the restart was translating into narrower losses and, eventually, victories. Ireland improved to the point that it actually qualified for the recent Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Other potential areas of focus are data visualization, as well as services that make it easier to manage the grassroots game – both from an administration and coaching perspective. “You have to improve the back end of the sport, not just the front end,” says Burghes. “We know coaches have to be able to submit team sheets or combine coaching data.” “There are lots of ways you can leverage AI and data in sport,” adds Ezzat. ""It can professionalize sports and make them better.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemccaskill/2021/09/06/world-rugby-partners-with-capgemini-to-digitize-the-2023-rugby-world-cup/,World Rugby Partners With Capgemini To Digitize The 2023 Rugby World Cup
"Video and live streaming apps fueled a $1.2 billion spending boom among social media users in 2020, a new report from app analytics firm App Annie said, as the pandemic saw an explosive rise in time spent on social apps and the creator economy. Video and live streaming apps have grown in popularity during the pandemic, according to App Annie.  Social media apps have been downloaded 74 billion times around the world in the last ten years, according to App Annie’s “The Evolution of Social Media” report published Monday, including some 4.7 billion downloads in the first half of 2021. Almost half (44%) of mobile screen time during the first half of 2021—740 billion hours globally—was spent on social apps, App Annie found, a slight drop from around 770 billion hours spent on the apps in both halves of 2020 but significantly more than pre-pandemic levels of broadly around 600 billion hours.  Video and live streaming platforms command increasingly large shares of time and money spent in social apps and have risen dramatically in the past four years, App Annie found, with live streaming apps like Twitch and Bigo Live forecast to rack up a collective 548 billion hours in 2021.  The surge in streaming also seeded a new creator economy on social media, the report said, built upon “gifting” content creators rather than one-off purchases.  The presence of apps like TikTok, Twitch and Bigo Live in the list of the top ten apps for consumer spend highlights this trend and in the first half of 2021, the U.S. alone spent nearly $1 billion in social apps, overtaking early adopter Japan. By 2025, App Annie estimates consumers will spend $17.2 billion through social apps a year. This works out to around 30% growth every year, with this year expected to hit $6.8 billion. Live streaming and video apps have soared in popularity during the pandemic, as has the app economy as a whole. Twitch, for example, has seen its global number of monthly active users go from just over 40 million in January 2019 to almost 90 million in January 2021, according to App Annie. YouTube and TikTok now outrank the likes of Disney+ and Netflix (which were number one 2017-2019) in terms of consumer spend among social, communication and entertainment apps, another indicator of the shift towards a creator economy, according to App Annie. In spite of streaming’s ascendance, the early social media and entertainment apps dominate in terms of time spent, with YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram comfortably holding the top four slots in as many years, according to App Annie and using information from the first half of 2021.   $34 billion. That’s the record-breaking amount of spending across all mobile apps in the second quarter of 2021, according to App Annie. Global app spending was up $2 billion from the previous quarter and $7 billion from the year before, despite the number of app downloads remaining relatively stable over that period.

"Clickbait Netflix has a new number one contender, which has planted itself at the #1 spot on the top ten list in the US and other regions, and does not appear to be moving any time soon. That would be Clickbait, the new “Limited Series” that suddenly seems popular enough to…maybe not be a limited series after all. Netflix uses the “Limited Series” tag to indicate that shows are one-and-done, and yet if you’ve seen the show, it’s kind of easy to imagine how this could turn into some sort of anthology instead. It’s hard to see the story continuing with the same cast, but using the same showrunner/writers and giving them a new “viral” murder mystery to solve seems like it might be in the cards. And so, Clickbait season 2 doesn’t seem like the craziest idea in the world. Clickbait has the central “hook” of a man abducted by unknown parties, forced to admit to various offenses, and then is supposed to be executed when the video hits 5 million views. The actual story is quite complex, and deals with other internet adjacent issues like photo leaks and catfishing, and it’s easy to see how the concept could be expanded to do another murder based on some sort of alternate viral storyline.  Netflix For me, Clickbait was a welcome surprise. I’m actually stunned to see it reviewing so low on Rotten Tomatoes, as I thought it was expertly scripted, a rare murder mystery that wasn’t full of annoying red herrings, misleading viewers enough to be tricky, but not enough to feel cheap. And the final reveal? Wild and out of nowhere, seemingly, but it works, and I left the eight episode series satisfied. I would watch more, certainly, from the same team. Though yes, likely with a whole new cast (and frankly, the cast was probably my least favorite part of the show).  The other option is that Netflix sees Clickbait’s success and offers the team just…an overall deal where they can do whatever they feel like. This would be similar to what we saw with The Haunting of Hill House, which was briefly, an anthology when we then got The Haunting of Bly Manor. But now they’re moving on to something else entirely, Midnight Mass. But it’s the same genre, just not “season 3” of The Haunting of Hill House. That said, Clickbait season 2 seems like more of a real possibility and an open door for a true anthology. We’ll have to see if that’s the way things play out, and nothing official have been announced yet, but I would not be surprised to hear about something of this nature in the coming weeks.

"FILE - In this June 16, 2020, file photo, orchard worker Francisco Hernandez reaches to pull honey ... [+] crisp apples off a tree during a thinning of the trees at an orchard in Yakima, Wash. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) A few years back I reviewed about 30 years of spending on housing by the State of Washington using the Housing Trust Fund. I found the state’s greatest housing shortage was in rural counties not Seattle. However, most of the money spent on housing was in Seattle and its county, King. With the help of Hamilton College student Chris Akuleme, I took a quick look at about a decade’s worth of money distributed to subsidized housing projects in Washington through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The results were, unfortunately, the same: money from the LIHTC favors wealthier and whiter urban King County over poorer rural counties.  To gather data from 2011 to 2020, we used the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s LIHTC Database. This is not the best source of data. However, to get full project information would require a lengthy disclosure process, and since the database exists, it seemed worth it to use it to take a look at tax credit investment over a period of years. It’s value is limited, but it is still a useful tool to get a broad picture of the use of tax credits. Right up front, I should also say that I hate the use of averages to describe issues related to affordability, the qualitative relationship consumers have to price. An average doesn’t capture outliers (anecdotes do that) and they leave out the fact that even when average prices are high and average wages low, there are still many units that people with low wages can pay for. Finally, the tax credit program doesn’t provide the bulk of funding for these projects. As non-profit advocates say, the tax credits are “leveraged” with other subsidies, or other subsidies are “leveraged” tax credits. It’s not clear from the database just how much this funding formed the final budgets of these projects. With those caveats, here’s what we found.  First, the LITHC program allows a taxpayer to use a contribution to subsidized housing to get a credit to reduce her taxes in an amount greater than her contribution to the program. The actual money ends up in the hands of state housing financing agencies that allocate those dollars in the form of equity to mostly non-profit (some for projects are for-profit projects) builders. So, the money in this analysis is real money, however the process of it getting from taxpayer to subsidized housing unit is complex.  Here’s a table that describes what we found in two counties and cities in Washington.  All the numbers: Seattle and King County come out on top when it comes to subsidies from the Low ... [+] Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program  Looking at the numbers: More poverty, less housing in Yakima Let’s look at tax credits in two counties, King and Yakima. King county did get a disproportionate amount of tax credits based on population. But over the period of review, Yakima County was allocated tax credits consistent with its population size. This is often what people will point out to me when I say that more dollars of housing subsidies flow into King County and Seattle than anywhere else: they have more people. And many would point to the other measures in the table, especially cost burden, the percentage of gross monthly income spent on housing.  Clearly, housing is cheaper in Yakima county and in the city of Yakima than in King County and Seattle. Looking at the cost burden in the two counties and cities, the problem is worse in Seattle when income levels drop to half the AMI. But this an obvious problem; people with fewer dollars see more of their income consumed by higher housing costs because fewer dollars to start with. If one looked only at average incomes and average rents, it would seem fair to push more money to King County and especially Seattle where the cost burden rises to above 50 % percent of average gross monthly income.  In Yakima County, where the poverty rate is 16.5 percent, one of the state's highest, the median income is $51,637, but in Yakima, the has an average median income is $44,950. The average rent in Yakima is about $868, an amount affordable to someone earning 100 % of AMI and even 80 % of AMI. At 50 % AMI the cost burden goes up. While Seattle’s rents are higher and consume even an even greater percentage of people’s income, there is a lot less housing being built in Yakima.  Housing production is lagging across the state. One source has the direct vacancy rate in Seattle at 8.11 percent and about 2.5 percent in Yakima. The numbers I use come from the University of Washington, and that review of vacancy rates across the state pegs the vacancy rate in Yakima county at 1.2 percent and King county’s at 5.3 percent. While rents are higher in Seattle and King County there is more housing available. And taking a look at housing production over the review period, 2011 to 2020, housing production wasn’t keeping up with growth anywhere in the state, including in Yakima.  The Office of Financial Management, using data from The United States Census, shows about 13,000 new people coming to Seattle between 2019 and 2020. In Yakima that number is only about 1,050 new people, the city grew from 94,440 people to 95,490 people, while Seattle grew from 747,300 to 761,100 people, or 13,800 new people,  If we look at housing production for that year, 2019 to 2020 the housing unit count in Seattle went from 367,806 to 376,117 an increase of 8,311 housing units or about 1.6 new people for each new housing unit created. In Yakima, the housing count went from 36,233 to 36,566 an increase of 333 housing units or about 3 people for each of the new housing units created.  Over the longer 2011-2020 period, the ratio of new people to new housing is lower in Seattle, about 2.3 people per new unit versus 2.7 per unit in Yakima county and 2.6 in the city of Yakima. Because we know there are more people in poverty in Yakima county, even though the ratios look similar, the real impact is greater since there just isn’t that much housing available in Yakima. When a new person arrives in the city or county, they are likely to have a lot less money than a new arrival in Seattle. In Yakima that new person is like to be a migrant Farmworker.  Demographics: A new ethnic majority represented by a political minority  Who lives in Yakima County? Only 43 percent of people in Yakima county are white, while about 49 percent are Hispanic and 70 percent of people living in the county are foreign born. Yakima is largely a county of immigrants of color. King county on the other hand is 57 percent white with a Hispanic population of about 9 percent and an immigrant population of about 34 percent. Seattle’s whiteness is even more blinding, with the city having a huge majority of white people, 75.9 percent with only 5.52 of the population being Hispanic. While it claims to be a city of diversity, it’s whiter than the state and King county.  Where is Washington's housing need and diversity?  As I pointed out in the post linked at the beginning of this post, rural Washington is poorer, more diverse, with older building stock, and a lot less housing than King County and Seattle. There’s no way to avoid it, more housing resources end up in the wealthy and politically powerful, Democratic Puget Sound, not in more rural and Republican Yakima county. As with Housing Trust Fund dollars, the irony is tragic for rural Washington. By any measure, there is more need for the construction of more housing – market rate and subsidized – in rural communities. Yet, Seattle has a local government that has its foot on the brake of production of new housing with too much regulation, rules that impact the development and construction of both market rate and subsidized housing.  Given their public posturing, one would think that the Democratic power structure in the state would be concerned about the large number of public resources being consumed by overregulated Seattle. It would also seem that Democrats would champion more of those resources for a community that fits their vision of a more diverse future, a county with a majority minority population of immigrants who work in the state’s largest industry, agriculture. Instead, Democratic legislators that dominate policy making on housing continue to make policies on things like eviction that will make matters worse for people that need housing in Seattle, what would almost seem like sabotage to justify more spending on the “crisis” there.   Conclusion  Market rate housing is hard to build in Yakima because people there can’t pay the rents required to cover the costs of land, construction, financing, and operation of new housing. Too many people there are struggling with poverty. When it comes to subsidized housing, the political process favors wealthier, white, and woke King county and Seattle, a city that hasn’t seen a housing regulation, fee, and tax it doesn’t like. Furthermore, when cost of building subsidized housing is taken into account, far more units could be built in places like Yakima, where it is needed most. The per unit cost based on the tax credit data I used is much lower, $10,625 in Yakima versus more than $23,000 in Seattle. One project’s total development cost was $47 million for 88 units, roughly $500,000 per unit.  The answer to the imbalance is pretty straightforward.

"Both blue and green hydrogen are essential components of a future sustainable energy system. Recent negative media coverage of blue hydrogen has left many people questioning its role in our future energy system. But much of the commentary is based on analysis that doesn't tell the full picture. Recent reports and government decisions show that blue hydrogen has a vital role to play, especially in achieving the rapid transition we must make to get to a sustainable energy system. Rather than pitching blue and green against each other, we must move forward with both. The end product of both blue and green hydrogen—an energy carrier and/or fuel that can be used without emitting harmful emissions into the atmosphere—is exactly the same. It's the method of production that defines the name. Types of hydrogen should really be defined by their emissions footprint rather than production method, but the green/blue distinction seems to be sticking.  Green means the hydrogen has been made using electricity and from renewable sources. But as with electric cars, the environmental footprint is determined by the power mix carbon intensity if it is connected to the grid. When directly produced from a dedicated wind or solar farm, green hydrogen production can be argued to have close to zero emissions. It is however very dependent on your system boundary. One perspective is that rather than using the zero-emission power from wind or solar to produce hydrogen, it should be used to decarbonize the far from decarbonized electricity system. Blue refers to hydrogen that has been made using natural gas, but with the CO2 emissions captured and stored. For both methods of production, it is crucial to account for all emissions in the value chain. Leaks will be detrimental to the performance of blue hydrogen, whereas high carbon intensity electricity will be detrimental to green hydrogen production. Some studies claim that blue hydrogen will be 20% worse for the environment than directly burning natural gas. A widely-quoted recent study by Howarth and Jacobsen (2021) uses results obtained under specific conditions to make generalized observations about blue hydrogen. As with any scientific study, the results generated are only relevant to the inputs made. In this case, the assumed methane leak rate and the technology and processes choices for hydrogen production and CCS are not relevant in a European context. The study uses a methane leak rate of more than 100 times what is recorded on the Norwegian continental shelf, and many times higher than the global average. The study also assumes hydrogen will be produced using steam methane reforming, which has a carbon capture rate of just 76%. While this is a relevant technology in some circumstances, the planned blue hydrogen technology choice is auto-thermal reforming. This has an expected capture rate of at least 95%. There are other issues with the study, but these two items alone clearly demonstrate how the study's results cannot be used to generalize about blue hydrogen. The fact is that all industries take time to mature. Fast-tracking development is possible, of course. Just look at how quickly smartphones have developed. But even the most optimistic forecasts show that a global green hydrogen infrastructure will take time to establish, and time is the ingredient we don't have any more. The incumbency in energy systems and the pace at which electrification of the energy system and society at large will need to happen will limit progress. Investing in blue hydrogen now could speed that up. Much of the expertise we need for blue hydrogen is already in place, and investment in the required carbon capture and storage solutions has never been higher. Built infrastructure and plants for using hydrogen will be available for zero-emission hydrogen in the future, regardless of production method. The U.K. government recently presented a hydrogen strategy that gives equal weight to blue and green hydrogen. Further details on the production strategy will follow in 2022, but the strategy document makes clear the 'twin-track' approach at its core. ""Unlocking the potential of hydrogen as a clean energy solution requires significant pace and innovation to scale up production, and the guidance from government today will be key to triggering the investment and buy-in needed to achieve this,"" said the National Grid's hydrogen director Antony Green. Other European countries also back a dual approach. In its hydrogen strategy presented in 2020, Norway highlighted the importance of investing now to support technology development and commercialization as natural gas with CCS (blue hydrogen) could become an ""important source of clean hydrogen."" This approach is backed by several recent European studies showing that the CO₂ intensity of blue and green hydrogen will be comparable when implementing appropriate and realistic technology concepts and boundary conditions in Europe. The IEA's Net Zero by 2050 report supposes a sixfold increase in global hydrogen production by 2050. Of that production, 40% is blue hydrogen. Meanwhile, the industry-funded Hydrogen4EU study found that 44% of the future hydrogen market can be delivered from natural gas with low associated emissions. Both these studies cover the entire energy system with emissions calculations that cover all sectors. A paper from the ACT Elegancy project compared the climate footprint of hydrogen production from both natural gas and biomethane to those of hydrogen production via electrolysis. The paper clearly shows that low emission hydrogen can be produced from both the green and blue pathways. Adding biomethane to such a process can even result in negative greenhouse gas emissions, or CO2 removal. There's no doubt that green hydrogen will be a dominant part of our future sustainable energy system. But while blue hydrogen has its issues, to stick our heads in the sand and pretend we can achieve our climate goals without it is dangerous. The latest UN report on climate change presented the uncomfortable truth that we do not have as much time as we had hoped. The climate crisis is upon us, so we must use all the tools in our toolbox to develop the solutions we need as fast as possible. Blue hydrogen is an enabler for that outcome.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/nilsrokke/2021/09/06/blue-hydrogen-isnt-the-climate-enemy-its-part-of-the-solution/,"Blue Hydrogen Isn’t The Climate Enemy, It’s Part Of The Solution"

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Without Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal and their combined 40 Grand Slam titles at this year’s U.S. Open, the rest of the field is “hungry” and “foaming at the mouth” to win matches and advance in the draw. So says American Frances Tiafoe, who took out No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev in the third round before losing to Canadian No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the fourth round late Sunday night, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6, 6-4. “You don't have Roger, Rafa,” Tiafoe said. “Guys are hungry, guys are like, The f—king Open, I got to f—king push.” He added: “I definitely think guys are trying extra hard, because there is [no] Roger, Rafa. I truly believe that. I see guys foaming in the mouth, pretty funny to watch, I'm in the locker room cracking up.” Of course, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic is playing at the Open and stands just four match-wins from becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the Grand Slam. Djokovic is set to face American Jenson Brooksby in the fourth round on Monday night at 7 p.m. Brooksby is one of three Americans on the card on Labor Day, along with No. 22 seed Reilly Opelka, the huge-serving 7-footer who faces Lloyd Harris of South Africa, and Shelby Rogers, who knocked off world No. 1 Ash Barty on Saturday and faces British 18-year-old Emma Raducanu Monday afternoon in Arthur Ashe Stadium. But with the “Big 3” reduced to a “Big 1,” Tiafoe sees everyone trying harder. He pointed to 37-year-old Italian veteran Andreas Seppi, who reached the third round before losing in four tough sets to German qualifier Oscar Otte. “You have Seppi like 37 playing 15-13 in the fifth [in his first-round match],” Tiafoe said. “What's that about? Crazy. His 19th U.S. Open, he's putting his heart on the line.

Alcaraz will next face 21-year-old Auger-Aliassime, with the winner through to the semifinals.  Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands became just the third qualifier ever to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals when he beat No. 11 Diego Schwartzman in five sets. He has earned $425,000 for making the quarters, life-changing money for a qualifier. He will next face No. 2 seed Daniil Medvedev, whom many consider the man with the best chance of beating Djokovic. It’s the first time that three qualifiers have made the Round of 16 of a major singles draw since 1995 at Roland Garros. “You have qualifiers in the run of 16, like tennis, like there is no bumps,” Tiafoe said. “Everyone's good. Like if you don't show up to play, you can lose to anyone.” Medvedev said his goal — and the goal of everyone else who might face Djokovic at the U.S. Open — is to beat him and prevent him from winning his record-setting 21st major and the Grand Slam. “Yeah, well since I’m here I want to say I’m going to try my best to keep it at 20 for all of them,” Medvedev said, referring to Djokovic, Rafael and Federer being tied at 20 majors. “Tennis is about winning tournaments and winning matches, [Djokovic] is very good at it so I’m sure Novak wants 45 Slams and [to] play until [he’s] 55.” NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 23: Novak Djokovic of Serbia; Rafael Nadal of Spain and Roger Federer of ...

"RICHMOND, VIRGINIA - SEPTEMBER 20: Kurt Busch, driver of the #1 Monster Energy Chevrolet, looks on ... [+] during qualifying for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway on September 20, 2019 in Richmond, Virginia. (Photo by Sean Gardner/Getty Images) To say that NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has had a tumultuous career in the sport is putting it somewhat mildly. When he burst onto the NASCAR scene at the turn of the century, Busch quickly established himself as a young, brash, in your face driver who was not known for making friends. Early in his career, the Las Vegas native raced for some of NASCAR’s biggest teams; he won a Cup title for Jack Roush in 2004 and took over the famous No. 2 for retiring NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Rusty Wallace at Penske in 2006. During the ensuing years, Busch went on to race for teams big and small. Along the way he also looked outside of NASCAR racing in the 2014 Indy 500 where he finished an impressive sixth place earning Rookie honors and the respect of many. He even secured his NHRA Pro Stock license in 2011 racing in that division at the NHRA Gatornationals.  Sponsorships for Busch have been almost as chaotic as his career. Most of the deals have come as part of whichever team he was racing for at the time. But as he has aged, Kurt Busch has become less of a controversial figure; he’s mellowed with time perhaps, and for at least one sponsor, has become just the kind of driver they want representing their brand. It’s a sponsorship that’s less that about the car he’s racing and more about the person Kurt Busch has become.  Monster Energy entered NASCAR fulltime in 2012 with Kyle Busch Motorsports (KBM) as that team made the move from the Truck series into NASCAR’s Xfinity series where Kurt joined his younger brother Kyle splitting time in the No. 54 car.  “I remember Mitch Covington (VP of sports marketing at Monster) made a comment; he goes, ‘man I can get two Busches for the price of one I'm in.’,” Kurt said with a smile.  Kurt would get Monster Energy’s first NASCAR win later that year. But it would be the only win for KBM that season, so the team decided to move operations to Joe Gibbs Racing the following season.  “That's where Kyle and Gibbs I think won 11 races the next year,” Kurt said. “I actually I was like ‘absolutely go over there win and we'll do something together over time.’” Kurt Busch began racing in NASCAR in 2000 (Photo by ISC Images & Archives via Getty Images) Monster Energy would go all in on NASCAR, becoming the title sponsor of the Cup series from 2017 to 2019. They would also sponsor Busch while he was driving for Stewart-Haas Racing during the time. That partnership continued when Busch moved to Chip Ganassi Racing as the start of the 2019 season. Following a driver wasn’t unusual for Monster. For them NASCAR sponsorships aren’t about the car, but the person behind the wheel.  “If you look at our roster of sponsored athletes around the world,” Covington said. “You can see we have a heavy belief in the influence and the power of the sponsorship for the individual; regardless of what bike manufacturer they ride or skateboard they ride or whatever, we're invested in that person who represents our brand.” And according to Covington that’s something that Kurt Busch has done very well. “You know, just the way it's worked out with the different teams he's went to, we decided to stay with Kurt because he's been a loyal athlete to Monster ever since the day we signed him,” Covington said. “He’s been a model sponsored-athlete for us. He easy to work with. He's always ready to jump on a plane and go see a customer, go to an event for us, see our sales meetings. He's just been a joy to do business with. We treat Kurt like family.” For the companies, and brands, that have NASCAR sponsorships, measuring the return on their investment can follow a formula based on such inputs as how many times their sponsored car appears on television screens, or how many mentions the brand gets in the media. For the Monster Energy brand, like their sponsorship model, the ROI measurement is looked at differently.  “Well, we do, and we don't,” Covington said. “We of course have sales data and all these kinds of things that big companies use to measure a so-called return on investment on a sponsorship.  “But it's always been our belief that it's hard to measure a return on investment in a sponsorship that you know it when it's good and you just know when it's working … we've certainly had that big a thing with NASCAR and with Kurt without numbers to get it to a calculated ROI. Right? But when you have equity in a personality like Kurt or any of the other hundreds and hundreds of athletes; people know that they're Monster athletes. When they see them they think about Monster. If you jump around every season and have a different person every year, you don't get that equity.” For teams, Busch brings more to the table than a sponsor. He brings his over two decades of experience. What many outside the garage may not know is that Kurt Busch has become an asset not only behind the wheel, but in the knowledge he has. That was a big attraction for the team where Busch will start the next, and perhaps final, chapter of his career behind the wheel.  Late last month it was announced that Busch will move to 23XI Racing for his 23rd season in the NASCAR Cup series. The move was precipitated when Trackhouse Racing announced in June that it had acquired the assets of Chip Ganassi Racing who will be leaving NASCAR after this year. As part of the acquisition, Trackhouse will field a second car with driver Ross Chastain from Ganassi partnering with Trackhouse’s current driver Daniel Suarez. That left Busch without a ride for 2022; until the 23XI announcement.  Mitch Covington is vice president of sports marketing for Monster Energy (Photo by Jared C. ... [+] Tilton/Stewart-Haas Racing via Getty Images) He'll move from Ganassi which fielded Chevrolets to 23XI, the team co-founded by driver Denny Hamilton and NBA legend Michael Jordan that will campaign Toyotas.  “As we all know decisions in the sport are driven by other factors, other pressures sponsorship etc., but this was a very intentional decision,” David Wilson president of Toyota Racing Development, U.S.A. said of signing Busch. “We picked Kurt specifically for all of the attributes that he brings to the table. There's not, I think, a better suited athlete to join the ranks of 23XI and Toyota. He will be a force to raise the bar for all of us and I’m very much looking forward to that.” The decision for Monster to follow Busch wasn’t a difficult one.  “When we were first approached on this by Denny and Michael,” Covington said. “You know we didn't know if Michael was just joining it in name only and he's friends with Denny and if he had a minor interest in it, so I remember us meeting with Michael and Denny and I asked Michael I said, ‘how much are you going to be involved?’ He takes a cigar out of his mouth, and he takes a drink and looks at me and he goes ‘look man I don't do anything to lose, I do everything to win’ and I’m like ‘sold we're in.’” For Hamlin, his new team will get a championship caliber driver, and a new sponsor as well.  “It's very rewarding,” Hamlin said. “I love the relationship that he's built with Monster. I’ve got a personal relationship with those guys; we've gone out to dinner for years and years and we always were trying to get creative on how we could eventually get together. But it just all worked out great where now we get a championship winning driver and a race-winning driver on a weekly basis to essentially analyze our team and see where we stack up and kind of set the bar to push our team to continue to move forward.” Kurt Busch admits that the move to 23XI Racing is part of an endgame of sorts.  Kurt Busch was the 2004 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series Champion (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images for ... [+] NASCAR) “I didn't know where 2022 was going to lead me,” Busch said. “I didn't know where the future was going to be in racing. The timing and the people and the relationships are making this happen. And now it's all telling me that this is the right place to be and it's most likely the final spot for me in NASCAR.” When he does end his career, Busch will likely be using his knowledge and experience to help others in the sport. What others will get is not the young, brash, in your face driver, that seemed to create controversy wherever he went early in his career, but a Kurt Busch who has matured.  “I think a key element is just being able to channel my emotions and my energy,” Busch said. “The things that might get caught by the camera or out into the public to the right situations and it's to build better crew members, it's to build better cars, it’s to create better sequences through how you gain points through the stages and leading through the Playoffs.” And he’s a driver who has learned valuable lessons himself along the way. “You know I learned a lot from my first team with (crew chief) Jimmy Fennig. We put a championship effort together and he taught me a lot about leadership. But I wasn't doing it in what you would say the public eye and that's where I think behind the scenes, people with hard cards or the teams I’ve raced for, each of the drivers that were my teammates. I want to always make them better because if I can make them better, they will make me better and ultimately the whole program will be more successful.  “So behind the scenes that's where things have really taken good root and that foundation that I’ve built now over the last decade and the comfort with a sponsor like Monster Energy has allowed me to feel confident in each and each place that I go and each track that we have a chance at winning.” When Kurt does finally decide to step out of the racecar, Monster Energy won’t be leaving NASCAR. They already have an eye towards the future; a future that will include the same type of sponsorship model they have with Kurt Busch. ""In NASCAR, we've certainly got our hopes on Hailie and Riley and Ty,"" - Mitch Covington (Photo by ... [+] Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images) “We’ve got other drivers in the Monster system,” Covington said. “Just in the NASCAR system, along with Hailie Deegan, Riley Herbst and Ty Gibbs. And we have NOS (Energy) our other brand that we also own that's involved with Ricky Stenhouse and Kyle Larson and some other people, I can't name them all.  “There's too many on the dirt track side, but in NASCAR, we've certainly got our hopes on Hailie and Riley and Ty. We would love to have long-term relationships with all those. We believe it's a long-term relationship with an that athlete pays off.” For the immediate future, however, the main focus for Monster Energy will be on the driver who started it all.  “We have a driver that we have the utmost in confidence in in Kurt and a long-term member of the team at Monster; and good friends in Denny and we just can't wait to get started,” Covington said. And for Kurt the future will be with a long-term sponsor he knows well and knows will be with him to the end.  “I think the key thing has been honesty and transparency right from the beginning,” Busch said. “And then the fun factor of course with the whole program. It's a lifestyle in a can; their edgy swagger fits the way that I race it fits the way that my image is portrayed and how the fans absorb things. “It's just it's amazing to see it all come full circle.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregengle/2021/09/06/kurt-busch-moving-to-possibly-his-last-nascar-team-with-a-monster-of-a-sponsor/,Kurt Busch Moving To Possibly His Last Nascar Team With A ‘Monster’ Of A Sponsor
"Yeah Yesterday, I made my way to a very empty theater right at opening to catch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, a movie getting massive praise from fans and critics alike, debuting as a top 5 MCU film and racking up sky-high audience scores. It did not disappoint. The film is stellar. Inhuman action, a gorgeous collection of settings and a stellar cast. And it also happened to resemble one of my favorite video game expansions of all time. Wait, what? If any avid Destiny fan watches Shang-Chi, about midway through the film you will start seeing parallels to Destiny 2: Forsaken, the game’s first expansion a few years back. To explain what exactly is going on here, I’ll have to get into spoiler territory, so turn back now if you haven’t seen the movie yet. Or I guess if you really don’t want to know what happens in Forsaken after three years.  A little while into the film, you begin to understand that Wenwu/The Real Mandarin, is not just trying to hunt down and murder his kids. He’s trying to collect their pendants gifted to them by their mother, and ultimately bring them home. Why? Because, as he informs them, he’s hearing their mother’s voice, who is telling him that she is not dead, but trapped behind a gate in her hometown, the mystical city of Ta Lo. And that Wenwu must come free her. Shang-Chi The problem? This is…not what’s happening. As Shang-Chi arrives in Ta Lo, he’s informed by his aunt that actually, there is a giant, ancient, soul-stealing evil trapped behind that door, and it’s using his father’s greatest desire to lure him to set it free. And did I mention this great evil is…a dragon? I mean, a bat-dragon-octopus…thing, but yeah, a dragon.  So, you see the main bridge now, a direct parallel of Destiny 2’s Forsaken storyline where we’re meant to hate Uldren, who has murdered our friend and caused all manner of chaos, but we learn that he’s doing so because he believe his sister is calling him to come free her from her apparent death. The problem there? Uldren is actually being tricked by an Ahamkara, Riven, a giant….dragon.  Destiny 2 Both men do the bidding of the dragon and surprise, it’s a very bad end result, and leads directly to their deaths. I mean… To be clear, I’m not accusing Shang-Chi of stealing anything from Forsaken, but I do think this is a pretty fun coincidence for Destiny fans. And I think the parallels don’t even stop with this major plot point. It’s also pretty easy to see Ta Lo as the Dreaming City, with both places being mystical realms full of a lost race of magical people, ancestors to our lead character (this works especially well if your Guardian is Awoken). It’s a place that is almost inaccessible to anyone, and you need a special ticket inside. And yet it is also under assault by invading forces that must be cleansed from the land. Ta Lo cleans things up by the end of the film. Destiny 2, three years later, is still trying to fix the Dreaming City (but maybe this season!). Destiny 2 Then, there’s the idea that the heroes are able to craft weapons from pieces of a dragon. In Ta Lo it’s dragon scales, in Destiny it’s Ahamkara dragon bones, the result of the Great Hunt. But both are integrated into many armor and weapons due to their special properties. In the end, it’s not a perfect fit. A full Uldren parallel would be Wenwu like, killing Awkafina in the first five minutes of the film, as Shang-Chi spends the rest of the movie trying to get revenge. And yet there’s enough here to be fun, and I though it was worth highlighting.

"Former Michigan kicker Quinn Nordin secured a 53-man roster spot with the New England Patriots as an ... [+] undrafted rookie. (Winslow Townson/AP Images for Panini) The names ranged from quarterback Brian Hoyer and running back Brandon Bolden to cornerback J.C. Jackson and wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. An undrafted rookie had made the New England Patriots’ initial 53-man roster for 17 consecutive years. Kicker Quinn Nordin made it 18 as the NFL deadline passed last week. The Michigan product, who was exploring LinkedIn for jobs before agreeing to terms nearly a week into May, did so without a signing bonus. He did so after a preseason that displayed both a strong right leg and a strong opportunity to work through what flew wide of the uprights. “I mean, I just try to stay in the present, focus on the job at hand,” Nordin said during his press conference Thursday at Gillette Stadium. “I think preseason was just awesome. The amount of reps I was able to get. I didn’t even know if I was going to get any reps in the preseason, so I think that was a really good experience, even getting kickoffs. I’m just going to try to use what I learned from that experience and take it to the first game.” Nordin made 6-of-8 field goals and 4-of-7 extra points over the course of August. Along the way came longs of 48 and 50 yards that were counteracted by a trio of misses from close distance against the Philadelphia Eagles. But the 23-year-old specialist rebounded versus the New York Giants. The finale at MetLife Stadium saw Nordin make all but a might-as-well attempt from 54 yards in the closing seconds. From there, the seconds ticked down slowly as New England’s roster reduced from 80 to 53. For Nordin, they ticked down on the phone talking to former Wolverines teammate Carlo Kemp, an undrafted defensive lineman in training camp with the Green Bay Packers. “We were playing Monopoly online on our phones with each other,” Nordin recalled. “I just tried to stay on the phone. I talked with people, talked with Carlo for probably three hours and then went to sleep. I woke up, came to the building and I was kind of like walking on eggshells. No one told me I made the team. No one told me I didn’t make the team. So, just kind of still here. I’m going to be here until they ask me to leave.” Nordin wasn’t asked to by 4 p.m. ET Tuesday. He would instead outlast 36-year-old incumbent Nick Folk. The 2007 Pro Bowler had twice been named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week and twice kicked game-winners from 50-plus yards with the Patriots last campaign. Folk finished with a career-best conversion rate of 92.9% on field goals, making 26 in a row to go with 30-of-33 of his extra points. The released Folk has since been retained on the practice squad after signing a one-year deal featuring $1.225 million guaranteed in March. Valuable insurance, he can be elevated to the active roster Nordin resides on at any time. But the lone member of New England’s 2021 undrafted class finds himself on it as the calendar turns to September. And in Nordin’s search for NFL consistency, he finds the mechanics of kicking relatable to two sports other than the consensus of golf. “Cornhole and NASCAR are two things I compare kicking to,” Nordin told reporters. “Throwing it and the mechanics of kicking, being smooth, the repeatable motion at a very small target. And then mentally, when you’re driving around a NASCAR track, you have to stay focused the whole time. There’s a saying like, if you put a robot in a car it would be able to do the same thing around a track a million times in a row. But when you put a person in a car, sometimes it can’t — one lap’s faster, one lap’s slower.” Nordin will try to keep the motion repeatable and the lap times close as New England’s undrafted streak from 2004 continues into 2021. The regular season kicks off next Sunday in Foxborough at 4:25 p.m. ET versus the Miami Dolphins.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2021/09/06/with-quinn-nordin-the-new-england-patriots-undrafted-streak-kicks-on-into-2021/,"With Quinn Nordin, The New England Patriots’ Undrafted Streak Kicks On Into 2021"
"Baltimore Orioles' Cedric Mullins watches his two-run home run against the New York Yankees during ... [+] the sixth inning of a baseball game on Sunday, Sept. 5, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) It was a little over 37 months ago when Kevin Gausman now anchoring the San Francisco Giants’ rotation attempted to hold back tears in a hallway outside the visiting clubhouse at Yankee Stadium as he headed out the door from the Baltimore Orioles. That modestly successful era of three postseason appearances from 2012 to 2017 and one epic ending of a Boston Red Sox collapse in 2011 is a thing of the recent past and what has followed is a run of historic losing. It was 115 defeats in 2018, 108 in 2019 and it is 92 and counting this year. In other words when you get the wins, savior them, especially when it comes against the Yankees. Appreciate the moments and bask in the fact going 7-9 so far against them may decide the AL East when the season ends on Oct. 3. For the Orioles, there were plenty of moments to savior from their third one-run victory in New York and fourth one-run in the season series. Saturday also featured plenty of moments worth enjoying such as Chris Ellis pitching five hitless innings and a team with an ERA approaching 6.00 no-hitting the Yankees for 6 1/3 innings. The Orioles did not get the no-hitter but the follow up was just as strong. They were opportunistic in rallying from a trio of three-run deficits and wound up shaking hands on the field at Yankee Stadium for the fourth time this year, something they did twice in 13 trips to the Bronx in the previous two seasons. Among the moments to enjoy was Cedric Mullins getting to the 25-25 club with his 25th homer, something only Don Baylor (1975) and Reggie Jackson (1976) when they stopped in Baltimore before eventually becoming Yankees.  “It’s crazy,” Mullins said. “Just to be told it’s been a solid minute since someone has come around and put together a 25/25 season. I’m just out there putting my all every single day and to have the results show is a pretty amazing feeling.” Other moments were Jorge Mateo, a former Yankee prospect, getting the tying hit by ending a 12-pitch at-bat that featured five foul balls off a struggling Andrew Heaney. The end of the at-bat was a single that he flared into short center just out of the reach of DJ LeMahieu’s glove.  The final moment was Tyler Wells getting his first save on just 12 pitches. He did not do it against the bottom of the lineup but 3-4-5, retiring sluggers Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Anthony Rizzo. Wells got his first save two years after undergoing Tommy John surgery. “For him to come in here and do what he’s done is outstanding for him and kind of gives hope for other guys watching that story that he’s been through,” Baltimore starter Keegan Akin. “I’m proud of him and just glad to have him here and finding the success he’s having in the backend of the bullpen.” The Orioles do not win often but they’ve more often against the Yankees than any other opponent this year. In the slog of a season that has seen them lose 14 straight in June and 19 straight in August, the Orioles spent a good part of this weekend enjoying the seven hours, 55 minutes it took for them to finish off two victories against the Yankees. “Had a chance to win all three games,” Hyde said. “I was really happy with how we came back from being down 4-1. I let our guys know, it’s OK to win 7-2 once in a while, also.” Perhaps the Orioles will get one or two of those coveted stress-free victories, but they’ll savior any of the victories they do get, especially if it impacts the postseason race and then hope for better things once their prospects are ready to be unveiled in the majors. Before this weekend, the last time the Orioles won in New York they hit four homers in a game when a cat ran on the field and in the words of Mullins, “broke the ankles of security guards.” Then they threatened the record for futility set when the 1988 team started 0-21. Now things are going a little better or as well as they can be going for a team on target to surpass 100 losses again. “It’s huge.” Mullins said. “It just kind of goes back to us having faith in each other. We always felt like we were very competitive and it just didn’t show at times. To come in and play well with the pressure on (in) tie games and come out on top is a great feeling.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryfleisher/2021/09/06/as-losses-pile-up-baltimore-orioles-savor-wins-over-new-york-yankees/,"As Losses Pile Up, Baltimore Orioles Savor Wins Over New York Yankees"
"A group of 11 right-wing Republican lawmakers mistakenly sent a letter addressed to the former CEO of Yahoo in an effort to pressure the company not to comply with a records request from the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 27: (L-R) Rep. Bob Good (R-VA), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Rep. Andy ... [+] Biggs (R-AZ), Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) hold a news conference outside the U.S. Department of Justice on July 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. The group of far-right conservatives held a news conference to demand answers from Attorney General Merrick Garland on the status of January 6 prisoners. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The letter, first reported by Forbes, was sent to Marissa Mayer, who resigned as CEO of the web services and email company more than four years ago, rather than current CEO Guru Gowrappan. The letter was one of more than a dozen, sent to companies including AT&T, Apple and Verizon, which owns Yahoo, by 11 right-wing Republicans including Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). The letters urge the companies to decline a request from the January 6 panel to preserve the phone records and data of Capitol riot defendants and others who sought to overturn the election, vowing to “pursue all legal remedies” if they don’t. Many of the letter’s signatories, such as Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), who spoke at a “Stop The Steal” rally outside the White House ahead of the Capitol riot, are likely being targeted by the probe. The letters address that likelihood, with the lawmakers telling the companies they “do not consent to the release of confidential call records or data” as part of their threat of legal action. Banks was tapped by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the committee in July. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had the final say over appointments to the panel, vetoed Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), prompting McCarthy to withdraw his other three picks. “I would certainly recommend he never go there again,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said Sunday of McCarthy telling the telecom companies the GOP “will not forget” who complied with the request if they retake the House. Kinzinger, one of two Republicans appointed to the committee by Pelosi, said the threat is “really bad politics.” One ethics watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), has gone as far as to file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics requesting an investigation into McCarthy and Greene for public comments they have made threatening companies not to comply with the request. 35. That’s the number of telecom, email and tech companies that were asked by the committee to preserve phone records. The panel has also sent records requests to 15 social media companies and eight federal agencies. Kinzinger and Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who became vice chair of the committee last week, are facing calls for removal from the House Republican conference, mainly by the same group of lawmakers that sent the letter to Mayer. McCarthy has not yet said whether there will be a vote on whether to remove them, as the lawmakers have requested.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/06/republicans-accidentally-send-letter-to-wrong-ceo-in-attempt-to-thwart-jan-6-probe/,Republicans Accidentally Send Letter To Wrong CEO In Attempt To Thwart Jan. 6 Probe
"The New England Patriots will open the 2021 regular season with Mac Jones starting under center. The ... [+] rookie went 36-of-52 passing for 389 yards and one touchdown in the preseason. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Mac Jones did not start a game in August for the New England Patriots. But with the release of 2020 team captain Cam Newton at the NFL’s 53-man roster deadline, the rookie quarterback will when the final score counts Sept. 12 at Gillette Stadium. His teammates can see why. “Mac Jones — he’s going to be that guy,” Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson said during his press conference Thursday afternoon. “I mean, he’s a rookie, but he plays like a vet. The way he reads defenses, the way he steps up in the pocket, delivers the ball — he’s improved since the first time I’d seen him.” The No. 15 overall pick went 36-of-52 passing for 389 yards and one touchdown during the preseason. Jones dealt with a handful of drops and was sacked a handful of times over that span of relief appearances. His 92.2 Pro Football Focus grade ranked ahead the four quarterbacks who were drafted before him in April, however. It also ranked third among all quarterbacks around the league. There were little things behind the larger results. “I think the biggest thing is when you see the offense may have a play called, and it may be a motion or you see a guy flinch where it might be a blitz, and you see him go to the line of scrimmage and making a different type of check,” New England defensive back Jalen Mills told reporters last week. “That’s what you want to see from not only a young guy but your quarterback in general. They have a predicated call, and he sees the defenses are attacking him a certain type of way and he changes the whole offense to a play that helps them get in a better position.” The position has shifted for Jones. The reigning national champion will be the first rookie quarterback to start a game in the regular season for New England since former third-round draft choice Jacoby Brissett did so in the fall of 2016. “Congrats to him. First of all, that’s a big accomplishment,” wide receiver Kendrick Bourne said of Jones on Thursday. “But just what I’ve seen through camp and these last few days, he’s locked in, he’s poised. He seems ready for the moment.” ""I think he’s more ready than anybody even really knows,"" wide receiver Kendrick Bourne said of the ... [+] No. 15 overall pick out of Alabama. (Staff Photo By Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald) Jones threw 41 touchdowns against four interceptions as a redshirt junior with the Crimson Tide. A unanimous All-American, first-team All-SEC selection and Davey O’Brien Award winner, he set a program record with 4,500 passing yards and an NCAA record by completing 77.4% of his passes. But a different area stuck out for Bourne when it came to the 23-year-old’s readiness in Patriots coordinator Josh McDaniels’ offense. “I would say the two-minute, for me, with Mac,” Bourne said. “He just seems so relaxed, making his adjustments. We’re moving fast, but it’s slowed down. He’s just seeing it well, and that’s what’s key — going through the right reads, going through the progressions well to get to the open person. … Or just the adjustments he’s been making. Josh sets up to change plays, but for him to see what’s going on to make the play change is what’s key. And he’s seeing it well, so he’s putting us in the best position to make the plays.” The next plays for Jones will come against fellow ex-Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami Dolphins next Sunday. “For any starter, I think you feel that pressure,” added Bourne. “But he was built for it, man, since ‘Bama. I think he’s more ready than anybody even really knows.” Jones nears the opener as the lone member of New England’s current active depth chart. In addition to Newton, who started 15 games last year and agreed to remain in March on a one-year deal featuring $3.5 million guaranteed, the organization released Brian Hoyer.

"A special forces unit of the Guinea Armed Forces ousted the country’s long-serving President Alpha Conde on Sunday in an apparent coup, causing global aluminum prices to soar over fears that the unrest in the West African nation could impact the supply of a raw material, bauxite, which is needed to make the metal. Members of Guinea's armed forces celebrate after the arrest of Guinea's president, Alpha Conde, in a ... [+] coup d'etat in Conakry. The military unit which claims to have seized power announced that they have dissolved Guinea’s government, its constitution and closed its land and air borders. The new military rulers have imposed a nationwide curfew “until further notice” and have said they plan to convene a meeting of Conde's cabinet later on Monday. Unrest in the world’s third-largest producer of bauxite has pushed aluminum prices to the highest level in over a decade. Prices of the metal in the London Metal Exchange climbed by 1.8% on Monday to $2775.50 per ton—the highest it has been since May 2011. In China, the aluminum futures jumped up nearly 3.5% to around $3,400 (CNY 21,970)—the highest it has been since 2006—before leveling off at around 2.3%. Following the announcement of the coup, the U.S. State Department issued a statement in which it said: “The United States condemns today’s events in Conakry… We urge all parties to forego violence and any efforts not supported by the Constitution and stand by the rule of law.” 64 million metric tonnes. That’s the amount of bauxite that Guinea produced in 2019 putting it third in the world behind Australia and China in terms of annual production. The country also holds the largest reserve of the aluminum ore in the world at 40 billion tons. Despite worldwide condemnation, the coup reportedly sparked celebrations in some quarters of the nation’s capital Conakry. Last year, the ousted president Conde secured a third term in an election that was marred by violent protests, claims of fraud, and controversy over changes to the country’s constitution to remove a two-term presidential limit. His return to power had sparked demonstrations in parts of the country which led to several deaths and hundreds of arrests. One Western diplomat told AFP that Sunday’s coup may have been sparked by the Conde government’s decision to dismiss a senior commander in the special forces—sparking a rebellion from some of the members of its group.

"As the East Coast recovers from the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida, another powerful storm is moving across the Atlantic and towards the U.S. as a Category 3 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said, warning of dangerous conditions off the East Coast even though a direct hit on the U.S. is unlikely Hurricane Larry is moving across the Atlantic and could cause dangerous conditions off the East ... [+] Coast.  The National Hurricane Center said Larry, which strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, has sustained winds of up to 120 mph as of Monday morning.  Larry is heading north and west over the open Atlantic and is forecast to approach Bermuda as a “large and powerful hurricane” during the next few days, according to the NHC, though the organization warned it was too soon to properly evaluate the threat. Larry is not expected to make landfall over the U.S., though the NHC warned of “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions” along the East Coast from the middle to end of this week.  The organization described Larry as a “large hurricane,” with hurricane-force winds extending up to 70 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds up to 175 miles from the center.  There are no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect.  Larry is the third major hurricane—Category 3 or higher—of the Atlantic hurricane season. It comes as millions across the Gulf and East Coasts recover from the devastation brought by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall over Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane in late August. Millions were left without power and dozens died as the storm tracked north across the U.S., many in flash floods brought on by heavy rain. The U.S. has faced an increasing number of severe weather-related disasters in recent years—including severe heat waves, droughts, wildfires and storms this year alone—which experts overwhelmingly attribute to human-driven climate change.      Hurricane Ida Makes Landfall In Louisiana As ‘Extremely Dangerous’ Category 4 Storm (Forbes) Hurricane Season About To Take A Major Turn For The Worse, Government Forecasters Say (Forbes) Weather-Related Disasters Skyrocketed Fivefold Over Past 50 Years, Says U.N.

 d is currently undergoing a multi-year transformation to bring more family-friendly Disney stories and attractions into the park. The latest attraction to be revealed at EPCOT is Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure inside the newly expanded France pavilion.  The ride follows the story of Remy the rat from Disney and Pixar’s movie Ratatouille as he scurries through Paris and a restaurant kitchen trying not to be caught by the head chef, Skinner. Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure combines screens and oversized props to make guests feel like they’ve been shrunk down to Remy’s height as they experience the attraction.  Walt Disney Imagineering created the experience to be multi-sensory, for example, when guests “run” with Remy under the broiler oven it gets hot in the room, when a champagne cork is popped water squirts out at riders, and when the chefs are busy cooking guests are going to smell what’s on the stove.  The trackless attraction uses some of the same technology that’s used in Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway. One big difference between Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure and the previous two attractions is that the rat-shaped ride vehicle is propped up on a stand so the vehicle can tilt and spin independently as guests go through different scenes.  Riders will notice that some scenes feature Remy and his friends speaking a blend of English and French. Walt Disney Imagineering said this helps to create a deeper storyline and enhance the overall authenticity of the France pavilion.  Once guests exit the attraction they walk back into the world of Remy’s idyllic Paris, where things are more cartoonish than in the front of the France pavilion. Pixar artists coined the term “crookedology” to describe the animated interpretation of Paris in the movie and Imagineers used the same aesthetic in the new expansion at EPCOT. Eagle-eyed fans will notice that lines on buildings are not straight and water drains turn many different ways. These exaggerated details help bring guests from a realistic view of France at the front of the pavilion and into the animated style of the movie.  Just outside the attraction entrance is a fountain with champagne bottles and Chef Remy at the top. Imagineering worked to get a nozzle for the champagne bottles to make the water coming out look as if it was champagne that was just uncorked and is bubbling and foaming out of the top of the bottle.  The new expansion is sure to be a hit with fans who have been looking forward to the new attraction for years. Currently, Walt Disney World is holding previews of the new ride and expansion for specific groups including Disney Vacation Club members and Walt Disney World annual pass holders. Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure and the New France pavilion expansion officially open October 1 as part of Walt Disney World’s 50th anniversary celebration. When the attraction officially opens it will utilize a boarding group system through the My Disney Experience app that is similar to the one used for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/megandubois/2021/09/06/epcots-newest-expansion-brings-guests-into-the-world-of-ratatouille/,EPCOT’S Newest Expansion Brings Guests Into The World Of Ratatouille
"Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria meets with the founders of Gemme Collective, a clothing rental ... [+] site, at the Sustainability Hub at Stockholm Fashion Week The new and improved Stockholm Fashion Week made its IRL debut August 31 through September 2, demonstrating leadership in sustainability. After a brief pause, the week reemerged in early 2020 with primarily digital presentations for the August and February 2021 installments. With the help of vaccines and Sweden's nonchalant approach to Covid-19, the Spring 2022 season hosted physical shows, events, showroom appointments and dinners to European and American press. Under leadership from Caterina Midby, secretary general of the Swedish Fashion Association, project manager Naira Abdul-Halim and a team of freelancers and volunteers, the event established the key role that Swedish designers and brands have in setting the the sustainable fashion bar by pioneering practices large scale and committing to change. Further, the event cemented core values that intersect at Stockholm Fashion Week: sustainability, technology and creativity. Fashion Future host Patrick Duffy speaks with Amanda Parkes of Pangaia and Danica Kragic Jensfelt, ... [+] professor of Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology on the ways science and tech intersect in sustainability Midby and Lena Patriksson Keller introduced the third installment of Fashion Future (formerly Fashion Tech Talks) hosted by Patrick Duffy of the Global Fashion Exchange to kick things off. The conference packed a lineup of some of the biggest names in the sustainable fashion sector. The leadership theme included global thought leaders and speakers for the movement such as Maisie Williams, actress and H&M global sustainability ambassador; Federica Marchionni, CEO of the Global Fashion Agenda; Anita Balchandani, Partner McKinsey London; Alice Bah Khunke, Swedish member European Parliament; Simon Collins, founder House of Collins along with Oskar Metsavahat, founder Osklen and Instituto-E and UNESCO sustainability ambassador who attended the conference either virtually or in-person.  Universally agreed upon are several issues plaguing the industry: overproduction or misjudging consumer desire; waste material and toxicity prompting a need recycling and safe ingredients to ramp up; and E-comm systems that negatively affect the planet, particularly through returns and transparency of a garments life. The solutions to these issues will rely heavily on tech, legislation, financing, and collaboration across the industry notorious for not working together. It is also highly unregulated. Thus, the industry needs to make strides to change either from a moral obligation or demand imposed by the consumer. Groups such as STICA—The Swedish Textile Initiative for Climate Action, whose founder and executive director Michael Schragger spoke at Fashion Future—offer a blueprint on how brands can take positive steps towards reducing their greenhouse gas emissions ad be held accountable. Topics ranged from tech developments such as building machinery to improve textiles from hemp; how science and tech meet to replace toxic black ink by developing a carbon-based ink from pollution; and the ways AI can play a role in reducing overproduction and tools to aid consumers with sizing, for example. Governments (and voters) need to impose stricter regulations and how financers can solve these issues. Amanda Parkes, Chief Innovation Officer of Pangaia, and Danica Kragic Jensfelt, a professor of Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology discussed science and tech intersecting suggesting plants such as bamboo and eucalyptus can create a new flower-based down to replace synthetic or traditional down filling or how tech can help you 'feel' a fabric. Another panel suggested looking to the automotive industry as an example of collaboration to change the sector, while another proposed legislation incentivizing investors to finance changes. Williams implored industry leaders like sponsor H&M to standardize sustainable practices to become affordable to smaller brands as currently, many of these steps to reduce environmental impact are costly. She also suggested that tech could further the consumer's engagement via 'Fitbit

Fast fashion has been labeled the industry's worst culprit and the world's largest fashion brand has contributed to clothing waste issues, as famously chronicled in a 2010 New York Times article. However, it's crucial to note Swedish retail giant H&M has financed several sustainable initiatives and companies. Case in point, they invested in Renewcell, which recycles textiles into a new pulp spun into fibers to become viscose and Lyocell along with other upcycling and recycling companies H&M CEO Helena Helmersson detailed additional steps the company has taken combat the problem. The Swedish giant was among the first to implement an eco-conscious collection, sourcing organic cotton. By pioneering this textile, they helped reduce the sticker price so that other companies could follow suit. Additionally, they have implemented clothing collection sites in stores, rentals for select merchandise, body-scanning technology to create the perfect (read non-returnable) denim jeans and installed the LOOOP-technology system in select stores that remake garments on site. After the half-day conference, shows and presentations got underway, with several notable brands demonstrating their sustainability commitment as a natural part of their business models. There was a designated sustainability hub open to the public, although almost every brand at Stockholm Fashion Week could boast eco-friendly aspects. Following are highlights from several brands. Guests visit the House of Dagmar showroom to view the Spring 2022 collection. House of Dagmar: Sisters Sofia Wallenstam, Karin Söderlind, and Kristina Tjäder carry on the family tradition—grandmother Dagmar was a tailor—with their collection of relaxed luxury which veers off traditional classic silhouettes for a decidedly modern approach with wardrobe building in mind. The clothes are rooted in sustainability practices. In February 2021, House of Dagmar was awarded the inaugural Zalando Sustainability Award for its attention to eco-friendly fabrics and tight-knit production methods.  Lazoschmidl: Josef Lazo and Andreas Schmidl released six womenswear looks during SFW. Borrowing the men's collection theme ""Overdose"" shown at Paris Fashion Week, the duo played with the idea of copy, both in terms of previous collections and written text. For this delivery, they engaged close colleague Ana Hernandez for the rave-ready pieces. The final look had ""Pre-Order Now"" written across, emphasizing the industry trend of ending over-production. CDLP co-founder Andreas Palm shares a Swedish tradition and the warm Scandinavian spirit at a SFW ... [+] crayfish dinner. CDLP: When founders Andreas Palm and Christian Larson decided men needed better looking and better fitting underwear, they launched a brand. They named it CDLP, which stands for ""Cadeau de la Providence,"" in French or a gift from the universe translated loosely. Today, the CDLP universe includes loungewear, pajamas and swimwear, and men's underwear, all made from sustainable fabrics such as Lyocell and other recycled materials. Beckman's College of Design and Swedish School of Textiles student showcase: The next generation of designers to emerge from Sweden's fashion institutes displayed their senior collections via a film and mannequins in a joint effort. Each designer employed a version of sustainability, whether it be recycling, upcycling, or deadstock fabrics, proving the next generation of designers is ready for sustainable fashion. While each deserved an A for their effort, prizes for one student at each school were awarded. Ronja Berg from Beckman's for her bemusing upcycled accessories-turned-garments and Kristine Boström from Swedish School of Textiles for her edgy yet commercially viable collection of patched seamed and raw-edge clothing. Charlott Vasberg: The accessories-centric brand added swimwear—some complete with a clever convertible built-in cover-up—made from nylon created by recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets.  ReRobe X Ada Swärd: The Stockholm-based 'pre-loved' marketplace ReRobe combines traditional retail, secondhand stores, and consignment service under one E-comm shop and app. They engaged Beckman’s College of Design graduate, designer and trans model Ada Swärd to design her first eponymous collection from pre-owned clothes. The result shows the model's unique aesthetic translates beautifully to clothing as well. Filippa K: When the brand was launched in 1993, it was Sweden's answer to Agnes B. and aimed at making simple, practical everyday stylish dressing stress-free. Today the timelessness of the designs is innately sustainable. The brand established FK Studio, which has begun to upcycle pieces donated back to the brand as part of their customer recycling initiative launched in 2015, giving new life to the old garments as truly one-of-a-kind pieces. ATP Atelier stages an ""auction"" to present their Spring 2022 collection of shoes and bags. ATP: Simple, streamlined and insanely chic, ATP co-founder and creative director Maj-La Pizzelli presented the Spring 2022 collection via a charming faux auction where guests held up paddles to bid 'need"" or 'love.' Generally, these items elicit both responses. The brand has been awarded a Butterfly Mark signaling their luxury brand sustainability thanks to their 80 percent non-toxic vegetable-dyed leathers and artisanal batch manufacturing which avoids overproduction. Gemme Collective – The recently launched circular fashion rental site considers the environmental cost of shipping E-comm items by encouraging renters and sellers to meet physically to do the exchange. While shipping is possible, the business model focuses on Gemme Collective as a local business and in theory, expansion to other markets would be regional as well. Think Airbnb for the circular clothing market. Iggy Jeans: 19-year-old Stockholm designer Ingrid ""Iggy"" Berg repurposes new and vintage jeans with her line of painted denim. Die Monde:  When designer and founder Angelo de Silveira of Die Monde, a youth-centric elevated streetwear collection, launched his brand, he was motivated by speaking to Stockholm’s new generation whose multi-ethnic backgrounds weren't always represented in the clothing offered. He enables human sustainability by working with newly arrived Syrian refugees with sewing skills to employ and help them integrate into Swedish society. As he puts it, ""it was a looking at a problem and seeing a solution,"" as the Togo-born designer was looking to keep his production local, thus more sustainable. Hope: Former Acne designer and Hope creative director Frida Bard takes the unisex concept one step further by adding dual sizing to garments that she feels work equally on men and women, thus eliminating creating two collections. Additionally, the brand has done away with pre-collections spreading the drops of the main collections to avoid overproduction and makes eco-conscious choices regarding manufacturing methods and materials. Stockholm Surfboard Club: Another Acne alum Manne Glad has built his love of surf into a brand that primarily sells and refurbishes custom surfboards and wet suits, which has expanded into a men’s clothing line with a retro-cool aesthetic heavy on Western and golf themes. Minna Palmquist:  Equal parts artist and designer, Palmquist explored the notion of the body image stereotypes in her latest collections of manipulated classics such as the T-shirt, classic white shirt and tailored jacket. Caterina Midby, left of the Swedish Fashion Association with Lena Patriksson Keller, right at the ... [+] Fashion Future talk.  Caterina Midby and the Swedish Fashion Association (SFA) team have helped put Stockholm Fashion Week back on the map since arriving in the role December 2019. This season marked the third installment and most in-person event since her arrival. Midby's background as an editor and sustainability leader at H&M qualify her to raise the awareness of the Swedish fashion industry. The Scandinavian country can attribute 11 percent of its exports to clothing and textiles. ""SFW is not just to boost sales—yes, that is the end goal—but our main objective is to show the value and depth of what Swedish fashion brands are doing sustainably and creatively with their cool style,"" says Midby adding, ""Sweden is a test market for a lot of brands being trend-conscious and open to new things because we are a diverse, open country."" She notes that Swedish brands are leading the sustainability movement with change and can help other brands with tools to implement change. The industry in general is far from producing a significant amount of environmentally zero-impact garments. Unlike its other European neighbors, the Swedish government doesn't support the fashion industry per se. Thus, sponsors such as Boozt.com, The Absolute Company, Stockholm-The Capital of Scandinavia, Launchmetrics and more were crucial. The SFA is also concerned with the sustainability of Stockholm Fashion Week long-term. ""We are just two staff people here where other cities London, (BFC), Paris (FHCM) and New York (CFDA) have bigger fashion organizations."" To that end, Midby feels the region should become a collective. ""I think we need a Nordic Fashion Week to hub the three events; Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Finland,"" she opines. ""This is the key to make it sustainable, we could take turns hosting and it makes it easier to draw attendees with less travel,"" she suggests adding it could be a more extended event of five or six days versus the current three-day models. ""This is the key to making it sustainable; We are a small region with small countries. Sweden is the biggest but still a small country."" That may be, but when it comes to sustainability, they roll big.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roxannerobinson/2021/09/06/sustainable-in-sweden-stockholm-fashion-week-returns-with-a-focus-on-the-future/,Sustainable In Sweden: Stockholm Fashion Week Returns With A Focus On The Future
"The Taliban on Monday claimed they have taken control of the northern province of Panjshir—the last major holdout against the militant group in Afghanistan—in a move that now brings all provinces under their control just three weeks after the group overran Kabul amid the withdrawal of the U.S. military and its allies. Militiamen loyal to Ahmad Massoud, son of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud, take part in a training ... [+] exercise, in Panjshir province, northeastern Afghanistan. In a statement issued on Twitter, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid announced the capture of the Panjshir Valley adding that the group’s victory has taken Afghanistan completely “out of the quagmire of war.” Mujahid’s statement attempted to assure residents of Panjshir that they will be “not be subjected to any discrimination,” as several families reportedly fled their homes ahead of the Taliban’s arrival.  All eight districts of the Panjshir valley were overrun by thousands of Taliban fighters overnight, the Associated Press reported. Ahmad Massoud, the head of the Panjshir-based National Resistance Front (NRF) announced on Sunday that his group was ready to cease fighting and continue negotiations with the Taliban as long as they stopped their attack on the region. Massoud is yet to make a comment on the Taliban’s claim of capturing the province but pictures shared on social media appear to show Taliban fighters standing in front of the Panjshir provincial governor’s compound. While acknowledging considerable battlefield losses, the NRF has rejected the Taliban’s claim about capturing Panjshir stating: “The NRF forces are present in all strategic positions across the valley to continue the fight. We assure the people of Afghanistan that the struggle against the Taliban & their partners will continue until justice & freedom prevails.” Last month, the Taliban stormed into power in Afghanistan as U.S.-led Western forces began withdrawing their presence from the country. But despite taking control of Kabul and all other provinces in the country, the militant group had failed to gain a foothold in the Panjshir Valley region. The province which lies to the north of the Afghan capital—previously home to the anti-Taliban militia known as the Northern Alliance—emerged as the base of operation for the so-called National Resistance Front. Ahmad Massoud—the son of the legendary anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud—had been leading the resistance group with backing from the country’s former vice president Amrullah Saleh. The group had been engaged in a fierce battle with the Taliban last week and the fighting intensified on Sunday as the Taliban claimed its forces had over the Rokha—one of the largest districts in Panjshir. Fahim Dashty, the resistance group’s spokesperson and nephew of Afghan leader Abdullah Abdullah was killed in battle on Sunday.

The company said it will cease offering Singapore dollar trading pairs and payment options from Friday and the app for these products will be removed from the Apple and Google Play stores. “Users are advised to complete all related peer-to-peer trades and remove related trade advertisements by Thursday, to avoid potential trading disputes,” it said. Binance said it doesn’t operate any official Telegram and other online communication channels in Singapore. “Our aim is to create a sustainable ecosystem around blockchain technology and digital assets,” the company said. “Binance welcomes developments to our industry’s regulatory framework as they pose opportunities for the market players to have greater collaboration with the regulators.

"Daniel Bryan debuted at AEW All Out. Fans chanted “yes!” as Kenny Omega and The Elite beat down Christian and The Jurassic Express following another successful title defense by Omega. As Omega was gloating, claiming nobody was on his level, AEW pulled off a very well-done swerve as the “yes” chants were answered with the shocking debut of Adam Cole.  Following a somewhat predictable heel turn by Cole, who rejoined his friends at The Elite, Daniel Bryan crashed the celebration with a new, trap version of Flight of the Valkyries.  “The landscape has changed,” said a poignant Jim Ross as All Out went off the air.  Daniel Bryan-to-AEW speculation ramped up as soon as he lost what would prove to be his final match in WWE against Roman Reigns on the April 30, 2021 broadcast of SmackDown. Per the stipulation, Bryan was banished from SmackDown. Though some assumed this just meant Bryan would inevitably end up on Raw (or NXT), Bryan’s loss was preceded by some eyebrow-raising comments as the former WWE champion discussed his desire to wrestle for outside promotions. “My contract is up soon. We need to figure out what's a good balance between home life and wrestling,” said Bryan during a meet-and-greet session on WrestleMania 37weekend.  “I never want to stop wrestling, I love it, it's just figuring that out. It'd be interesting if I could wrestle in different companies and WWE. That's something I'm trying to weasel my way into right now."" Not too long after Bryan’s loss, Cassidy Haynes of Bodyslam.net (h/t Forbes) reported Bryan was “100% locked in” with AEW. The sudden turn of events coincided with news that CM Punk was also AEW-bound, and three weeks after Punk’s memorable debut at AEW First Dance, Bryan made his own triumphant return at AEW All Out.  Punk has aggressively teased the forthcoming arrival of Bryan, first by responding to a “yes” chant by telling fans to be patient during his AEW Dynamite debut. As another tease, Punk then took to Instagram stories to share a photo of the two shaking hands in ROH. Speculation of both Bryan and Punk in AEW has helped the piping-hot promotion inch closer to a sellout as it prepares to run New York City’s Arthur Ashe Stadium. With rumors that Adam Cole is on his way as well, AEW President Tony Khan is taking a very deliberate direction toward building his company around prototypical Internet Wrestling Darlings and stars of the indies.  AEW has also developed an affinity for former WWE stars. In fact, whispers of former WWE Superstars overtaking AEW will only grow louder, and could be prone to backlash (both from within the AEW locker room and within its own loyal fanbase), the more names like CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Miro and Malakai Black are prioritized over home-grown AEW stars.  At +175, CM Punk was the betting favorite to be Daniel Bryan’s first opponent when, when betting odds were released last month. AEW world champion Kenny Omega was a close second at +450. Given Bryan’s sudden involvement with Adam Cole, Cole too could emerge as a darkhorse to be Bryan’s first opponent.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2021/09/05/aew-all-out-results-bryan-danielson-daniel-bryan-debuts-against-adam-cole-the-elite/,"AEW All Out 2021 Results: Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan) Debuts Against Adam Cole, The Elite"
"Adam Cole debuted in AEW AEW All Out advertised the long-awaited in-ring return of CM Punk as he faced Darby All Out also featured the debuts of Ruby SoHo and a surprise debuts of Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan amid reports that Bryan was set to debut at All Out by Cassidy Haynes of Bodyslam.net. Cole promptly tuned heel, super kicking Jungle Boy and joining The Elite “Who’s ready for story time with Adam Cole, Bay Bay?!” said a heel Adam Cole, who remarked “ain’t nobody is going to stop us!”  This brought out Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan), who is now using a trap version of his Flight of the Valkyries theme music. With both Daniel Bryan and Adam Cole in AEW, AEW continues to lean in on acquiring former WWE Superstars who also made their name in the indies.  On what will be AEW’s biggest pay-per-view, from a buyrate standpoint, AEW All Out advertised the following matches:    AEW Dynamite garnered 1.047 million viewers this week for the go-home show of All Out 2021.              Eddie Kingston already has a t-shirt that read “Redeem Deez Nuts,” which is genius.  I loved the statistics about Miro being the most efficient TNT champion of all time.  Of course, this match started off with a “Redeem Deez Nuts” chant.  Miro showed off a shocking vertical leap while delivering a drop kick to Kingston.  Jon Moxley wore a GCW hoodie on an AEW pay-per-view one night after winning the GCW World Championship. As hard as Kojima worked, the story was the arrival of Minoru Suzuki. Suzuki and Moxley had a very brief preview of a match that whipped this crowd into a frenzy better than almost anything on this show.  Suzuki thankfully walked out to Kaze Ni Nare and the hardcore fans in Chicago sang along as if it were in New Japan.  Despite Britt Baker’s popularity, Kris Statlander was able to seize significant fan support just by being Kris Statlander.  Rebel was very entertaining screaming from ringside.  Those wanting an Adam Cole Easter Egg were not disappointed as Britt Baker employed a “Pittsburgh Sunrise” Canadian Destroyer.  The Lucha Bros were played to the ring live in one of the best AEW entrances you’ll ever see.  Tony Schiavone twice told Don Callis he was full of [expletive].  This cage was exposed as a sham when Brandon Cutler tossed spiked Jordans into the ring.  This was a great WWE-style cage match filled with AEW spots and I don’t see anything on this show being better. AEW made The Lucha Brothers into superstars in just one match.  May God have mercy on whoever had to follow this.          Skye Blue was the sentimental favorite in her hometown of Chicago, but she deserves a full-time AEW contract outside of this.  There was huge heat for the eliminations of Hikaru Shida, Riho, Jade Cargill and especially Skye Blue.  Ruby SoHo has awesome new theme music (Ruby Soho by Rancid) and she received an unbelievable ovation when she was revealed as as The Joker.  Chris Jericho’s acapella entrance, featuring Fozzy’s Billy Gray, quickly fell apart when the fans seemed to get lost while trying to sing Jericho’s theme song. I had a hard time believing that this was going to be Jericho’s last entrance in AEW.  Aubrey Edwards counted three despite Jericho’s foot being on the rope, leading to a correction as the match restarted. More WWE-style booking from AEW, but the fans were with it big time.  The cameras had a tough time keeping up with a lot of the run-ins and entrances up the aisle, including Jake Hager’s brawl with Wardlow  Chris Jericho making MJF tap out was typical poetic justice and this loss won’t hurt MJF in the least.  The fact that this isn’t the main event tells me Daniel Bryan has to be showing up by the end of the night.  CM Punk, who looked much better in new long tights, finally got to say “It’s Clobbering Time” along with his hometown.  Surprisingly, fans were split between Darby Allin and CM Punk.  The first several minutes of this match dragged on as CM Punk, who is much bigger than Darby Allin, worked this match like Frank Gotch and slapped on holds throughout this match.  CM Punk called back to his match against John Cena in Chicago on two different occasions.  CM Punk tried to take the countout in yet another sign of a potential heel turn.  This match lasted several minutes longer than I thought it would, and QT Marshall got much more offense than I thought he would.  This match featured a significant amount of outside interference as this was just as much of a Big Show match as it was a Paul Wight match.  These two had a very hard time following some hot matches, but they slowly chipped away at this crowd as the match went on.  This was a solid main event, but it was arguably weaker than their match on AEW Rampage, which did have the benefit of kicking off a very hot show.  Fans went home with far more than they bargained for as AEW All Out featured the returns of both Daniel Bryan and Adam Cole. This is setting up to be such a historical fall season.

"CM Punk returned to the ring against Darby Allin. CM Punk made his in-ring return at AEW All Out 2021, defeating Darby Allin after two GTS finishers. Punk looked like he never left, physically, as he might have been in better condition than his prime years in WWE. Though many fans marveled at how good Punk looked, physically, many were split on Twitter as to how good his return match was on its own merits.  AEW All Out was filled with high-octane wrestling prior to this return match, particularly an instant classic inside a Steel Cage between The Young Bucks and The Lucha Bros. Many old-school wrestling enthusiasts enjoyed the slower pacing of this match, while others were left somewhat underwhelmed with CM Punk’s first match in seven years.  Punk’s return will very likely lead to AEW All Out becoming the promotion’s biggest pay-per-view ever in terms of PPV buys. Surprisingly, his match against Darby Allin was not the main event. AEW stayed true to its most prestigious title and main-evented All Out with Christian vs. Kenny Omega.  CM Punk returned with an improved physique and new gear, featuring long tights with the stars from the Chicago flag on the side. Fans were very much into CM Punk, chanting “Holy [expletive]” as he sat in the middle of the ring and stared down his first opponent in seven years.  Though this is certainly a new CM Punk in AEW, Punk still played the hits. Punk twice called back to his iconic match against John Cena at WWE Money in the Bank 2011, once where he jokingly asked fans who they were chanting for, and then again when Darby Allin went flying to the outside after Punk hit a GTS. Punk also hit the step-up knee and two GTS’ for the finish.  CM Punk appeared to be working this match as a heel, which seemed like the more natural fit as Punk was far bigger than Allin. Punk spent much of the opening minutes of the match slowing the pace, locking Allin down in submission holds before Darby Allin made a spirited, high-flying comeback.  Punk looked just fine in his return, though the match was not up to the standards of some of its high-caliber predecessors. Mixed reactions aside, CM Punk’s comeback tour projects to live past expectations now that he has his first match out of the way.

"The Walking Dead There’s a scene in The Walking Dead’s latest episode—‘Hunted’—that perfectly encapsulates all of my frustrations with this new-and-improved zombie show. Things have gotten better since the embarassment that was Seasons 7 and 8, but quality control is still nowhere to be found when it comes to the script, which the show’s writers under Angela Kang continue to fumble. The scene I’m talking about involves several of Alexandria’s surviving women who have gone out to retrieve the community’s horses. Carol, Magna, Rosita and Kelly set out to find the horses and instead find many of their corpses. Feeling defeated, they decide to return home before it gets dark. Then, miraculously, the horses appear over a crest, galloping across a field. They’re headed toward the dairy farm, one of the women exclaims. We can pen them up there! And so off they go, on foot, to catch the horses. We cut ahead to the dairy farm where the last of the steeds is being successfully corralled. A job well done. But how? How did these four women, all on foot, wrangle all these horses up? How did they manage to catch up with them in the first place, let alone herd them through a gate? In an earlier scene they attempt to catch just one of these beasts and all four of them at once couldn’t get a lasso ‘round its neck. How, then, are we to believe they caught all the rest? It’s preposterous. The Walking Dead It reminds me of the first episode of the season when Ezekiel, Yumiko, Eugene and Princess manage to get out of their cage, steal two suits of Stormtrooper armor and almost make good their escape from the Commonwealth.  Sure, we knew that two of the guards were bumping ugly on break and had to take off their armor in order to do the deed—but how did our heroes know where that was taking place, let alone reach the armor without detection—let alone get out of their cage to begin with? It’s not just an oversight, it’s lazy—and arrogant—writing. Angela Kang may as well say it out loud: “We think our audience is stupid, so we’re going to write these ludicrous, implausible scenarios and not even show our work and our stupid audience will just lap it up anyways.” That’s been the arrogant attitude of The Walking Dead’s showrunners since Scott M. Gimple was in charge. Either that or they really don’t understand that even though this is a zombie show, we expect things to make sense. We expect characters to act in ways that are plausible and sensible and to suffer consequences for making stupid or selfish decisions.  Things can’t just happen and that’s especially true offscreen. Carol’s little group of cowgirls wouldn’t have stood any reasonable chance of wrangling a dozen or so horses up on foot so easily, so they just don’t show it. Why even have the sequence to begin with? Why not just have the horses wander into town?  The better scene, by far, is Carol’s painful decision to kill one of the horses so that the people of Alexandria could eat, but even that was confusing since we see the kids eating bits of meat at the same exact time as Carol is out in the stables killing the poor creature. Was that not horse meat, then? Were they eating something else? It’s confusing. The Walking Dead The Carol horse-whisperer stuff is the side-plot in tonight’s episode. The real meat of the story (well, the figurative meat of the story, in any case) is entirely focused on the survivors of the Reaper attack. (At a certain point the names of all these groups gets so stupid and annoying—Wolves, Saviors, Whisperers, Reapers and yet our own heroes have no such moniker, why is that?) The opening scene is a poorly choreographed disaster pretending to be an exciting action sequence. What’s with the weird lighting on Maggie’s face during each close-up? Why is this shot filmed from such a distracting angle, with our heroes all sort of running here and there while the off-screen Reapers throw hatchets and knives at them? When the big guy is hit with those knives they look like they’re moving in slow-motion. Why does the one Reaper just nick Gabriel’s neck? It’s just a distractingly bad opening segment. From here, things pick up a little. Maggie finds herself suddenly, inexplicably alone and wanders off I guess either to just get away or to find other survivors? She goes to an abandoned department store and almost gets a throwing knife to the back. When she gets inside, the Reapers are apparently already there—I guess one of their superpowers is knowing exactly where the good guys will be. She finds Alden in a big, open room at the top of the building. He’s hurt and how he made it this far on his own remains a mystery. Two Reapers appear quite literally out of nowhere and tackle Alden and Maggie to the ground. Another Reaper superpower is being able to move with absolute silence and invisibility. Maggie’s almost a goner when Negan shows up to save her. He almost manages to save the episode as well, but not quite. Still, things do get better once he’s around. They help Alden out of the building and find two more of Maggie’s people. A woman named Agatha and the big guy, who is on death’s door. Why bother learning any of these peoples’ names when they’re just used as cheap deaths? Maggie has now lost almost all of the people she brought with her to Alexandria. Elijah—Maggie’s own masked friend who apparently sports a similar style as the Reapers—was taken prisoner, it appears, though I’m not 100% certain about that. So it’s just Agatha left, and a few minutes later she gets bitten by a zombie. Maggie tries to save her and Negan is forced to carry her off—saving her a second time from certain death, not that Maggie is grateful. She gives another speech about how he’s not one of them, never will be, blah blah blah. Maggie you left for years. Negan’s more a part of the group than you are at this point. They leave Alden on his lonesome after Negan tells Maggie she needs to make the call and she goes on some silly monologue about how he doesn’t get to decide who lives and dies anymore. “You still need to decide,” he says, looking tired more than anything. So they leave Alden behind and promise to return for him after they . . . well I’m not really sure what the plan is at this point. Negan kills a zombie outside and the blood dripping from his crowbar reminds them both of the time when Glenn met Lucille. It just reminds me of when this show took such a massive turn for the worse and I find myself puzzled at how much I’ve come to like Negan and how much I’ve come to dislike Maggie. Watch my video review of this episode below: The best female characters in this show are not its stars. Carol is almost constantly irritating with her constant wishy-washy melodramatic nonsense. Maggie is a one-note bore and we were better off without her. Give us more of Rosita’s level-headed sensibility; more of Princess’s zany weirdness. Magna and Yumiko, when not being written into a silly relationship corner, are more interesting and layered.  But The Walking Dead insists on making Maggie and Carol this show’s female stars whether they bring anything to the table or not, and Michonne is gone after losing all credibility when she left her children behind during the middle of a desperate and terrifying war with the Whisperers. So here we are. Gabriel, meanwhile, continues to be one of the show’s most surprising characters, having gone from sniveling coward and rat to one of the most cold-blooded killers in our merry little band. When he tracks down the wounded Reaper, the man asks him to pray with him (exposing the group as a band of religious zealots) and Gabriel gets the best line of the episode. “I thought you were a man of God,” the Reaper says. “God isn’t here anymore,” Gabriel replies before killing him.  Gabriel In many ways, Negan and Gabriel are the two characters who have changed the most and the most consistently. Carol changes constantly but with no real consistency in her arc; Rick was the same way. Daryl changed long ago but he’s remained pretty much the same dude for many seasons now. Negan and Gabriel have had the most dynamic and interesting arcs. All told, this was a pretty weak episode. The opening two were better (though better still as one long episode) but when you stand all three next to each other, it’s a pretty shaky start to The Walking Dead’s final season that does little to make me optimistic for what comes next. Maybe this was just a bad episode tucked in among good ones. We shall see. What did you think? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook. Oh, and don’t forget to watch this World Beyond Season 2 trailer!

"New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone, left, argues with home plate umpire Jeff Nelson after being ... [+] ejected from the game against the Baltimore Orioles during the fifth inning of a baseball game on Sunday, Sept. 5, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) It took the New York Yankees three hours, 48 minutes to barely survive a fierce battle with the Baltimore Orioles on Friday. It took them 7 hours, 55 minutes to complete an underwhelming series against the worst team in baseball with two losses. While the Yankees built enough equity during their 13-game winning streak, several of the traits from an inconsistent first half are reappearing since the streak. The Yankees are 2-6 in their last eight with each defeat coming by two runs or less. Those are the same games the Yankees survived during their longest winning streak since 1961. Those are also the same games the Yankees often did not survive for most of the first half when they were a .500 team through 82 games and were the owners of seven “worst losses of the season.” These fall into the worst losses of the season bucket, mostly because of the talent disparity. The name talent did not consistently perform against a team well on its way to losing at least 100 games for the third straight 162-game season. On Saturday, the Yankees were no-hit for 6 1/3 innings, though they had several hard outs. They wound up with three hits and the only one to leave the infield was a game-tying two-run homer by Joey Gallo, a guy who needed a hit more than anyone. He was in a 0-for-17 skid until clearing the fence but for all his attributes on defense and for getting on base, Gallo is hitting .134 (16-for-119) with the Yankees. The low average was expected but the hope was it would not be this low. Gallo’s homer was negated by Aroldis Chapman not being able to keep the game tied and continuing his run of outings that make fans nervous. Chapman is 25-for-29 in saves and holds a 3.72 ERA, numbers that are acceptable for a closer but has faced three batters in 19 of his 50 outings, meaning most of his innings can be a rollercoaster. Then came Sunday and the bad news hit about two and a half hours before Gary Sanchez’s big day of two homers (grand slam, two-run shot) and six RBIs were wasted in what became a four-hour 8-7 loss. Before a pitch was thrown came the revelation that Jonathan Loaisiga was going on the injured list with a strained right rotator cuff, leaving the Yankees even thinner in a bullpen that has thrown 497 2/3 innings. The Yankees sill head into the third milepost (Labor Day) in control of home field for the wild card game but the lead is down to a half-game and the gap will tighten even further is the next four games against the slugging Toronto Blue Jays unfold poorly. The performances against the Orioles are likely going to decide the AL East just like they did since the start of the 2018 season.  In 2018, the Red Sox were 16-3 while the Yankees were 12-7 against a 115-loss Orioles’ team. The difference between the teams was eight games and the Red Sox went all the way. In 2019, the Yankees were 17-2 and the Rays were 12-7 against a 108-loss team. The difference was a seven-game edge in the division for the Yankees. This year the Yankees are 9-7 against the Orioles, who have four one-run victories. The Rays are 18-1 and the gap in the division is 7 1/2 games.  The Yankees wound up with 14 hits in 29 innings against Baltimore and the rest of the team outside of Sanchez went 5-for-30. Following Sanchez’s second homer, the Yankees were 1-for-12 with the one hit being an infield single that deflected off a reliever. Being forced into close games against the Orioles has set the Yankees up poorly against the Jays, who have slugged their way to a 7-1 tear and scored 29 runs over the weekend while the Yankees finished with 14 runs. “Incredibly frustrating that we didn’t put our best foot forward in the past couple of days,” manager Aaron Boone said. “We’ve got to do better. But the good thing is we hold the pen, we get to write the story still. And we’ve responded from tough days, tough moments, tough stretches, and we have to do it again.” The Yankees have spent most of the second half responding properly. They survived the COVID-19 outbreak right after the All-Star break, and three bad losses in Fenway that seemingly left them unlikely to reach the playoffs. Now comes their next test in the battle of survival known as the AL playoff race, one that can’t be as underwhelming as this weekend was. “That’s been the hallmark of when we’ve been at our best this year; when we’ve been playing really good baseball is when everyone’s contributed,” Boone said. “And we’re going to need to continue that through this difficult stretch we’re in now.” Truer words have never been spoken about a team who seldom plays a stress-free game.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryfleisher/2021/09/05/underwhelming-weekend-vs-baltimore-orioles-may-come-back-to-bite-new-york-yankees/,Underwhelming Weekend Vs.

AFP PHOTO / PATRICK KOVARIK (Photo credit should read PATRICK KOVARIK/AFP via Getty Images) Despite the fact that his latest full-length didn’t even have a full seven days in which to rack up sales and streams, Kanye West’s Donda easily debuts at No. 1 on this week’s Billboard 200, bringing the rapper back to the summit of the most competitive albums ranking in the U.S. Donda opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 309,000 equivalent units shifted. That sum includes 37,000 actual purchases as well as a staggering 272,000 streaming equivalent units, which are made up of 357 million plays on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. West’s new set now holds the record for the largest debut for an album in 2021, beating Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour, which started atop the tally in May with close to 300,000 copies shifted. West has now sent nine of his solo albums to the top of the Billboard 200, with Donda marking his milestone tenth release to conquer the list. He and Jay-Z also launched their joint project Watch The Throne in first place, though it was officially credited to both the duo called The Throne, with only the two rappers as members, as well as both rappers’ names individually. West’s own albums Late Registration, Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Yeezus, The Life of Pablo, Ye and Jesus Is King all took a turn running the show. In addition to his 10 total No. 1 albums, West has also appeared inside the top 10 on the Billboard 200 with three other albums, with just one being credited solely to him. His debut full-length The College Dropout stalled at No. 2, as did both Kids See Ghosts, a collaborative collection with Kid Cudi (as the duo Kids See Ghosts) and Cruel Summer, a compilation/album hybrid from West’s record label Good Music.  Donda was released Sunday, August 29, instead of on Friday, which is when the tracking week begins. The rapper’s manager had promised the set on August 27, but it wasn’t quite ready, and thus came out late. Donda had several different release dates throughout its long production process, many of which came and went with no music, as the rapper was busy perfecting the songs in between highly-attended live events where he played the tracks for tens of thousands of fans. West beats singer-songwriter Halsey to the Billboard 200’s throne, keeping them from landing a second No. 1 on the ranking. Halsey announced their new set in late June, but due to the fact that the hip-hop musician kept pushing his latest, he ended up competing with the star for the highest space on the tally. Halsey’s If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power starts in second place with 98,000 equivalent units shifted, which would have been enough to make it a No. 1 had something larger not gotten in the way. Chances are that many, if not all of the songs featured on Donda will find their way to the Hot 100 in short order. West has a good chance of scoring at least one, if not several top 10 hits on the chart, based solely on incredible streaming activity. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/05/kanye-wests-donda-scores-the-largest-debut-of-the-year-becomes-his-tenth-no-1-album/,"Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ Scores The Largest Debut Of The Year, Becomes His Tenth No. 1 Album"

(Photo by Chris Weeks/WireImage) Two brand new releases enjoy noticeable starts on this week’s World Albums chart, bringing two of the most beloved acts from different Asian nations to the ranking once again. One of them is used to appearing on the roster fairly regularly these days, while the other hasn’t been present for years, though clearly her power and popularity has not diminished very much (if at all) during that time.  Here are three titles to pay attention to on this week’s World Albums chart. No. 1 - Tomorrow X Together - The Chaos Chapter: Freeze As is often the case with the most popular acts based in South Korea, Tomorrow X Together recently re-released their album The Chaos Chapter: Freeze as a deluxe edition with several new songs. In their home country, the newly-retitled The Chaos Chapter: Fight or Escape easily opened at No. 1 on the Gaon Albums chart, giving the band another leader. In the U.S., however, the two projects are counted as one, so while they don’t land a new win, they do surge on a number of Billboard charts. The Chaos Chapter: Freeze returns to No. 1 on the World Albums chart, where it debuted when the original iteration of the title was made available a few months back. The set also makes its way back to the top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Album Sales rankings, proving just how popular the group, and their collection, remains. No. 5 - Stray Kids - Noeasy South Korean all-male vocal band Stray Kids return to the top 10 on the World Albums chart with their second full-length Noeasy, which is no easy feat. The title launches at No. 5, entering the highest half of the uppermost tier on the tally. The project is the group’s tenth to appear inside the loftiest space on the list.   This week, seven tracks by Stray Kids land on the corresponding World Digital Song Sales chart, giving the band control over more than one-quarter of all the spaces on the tally, demonstrating yet again that they are quickly becoming one of the most successful and reliable K-pop acts in America. No. 12 - Hikaru Utada - One Last Kiss Legendary Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada returns to the World Albums chart this week with her EP One Last Kiss, which launches at No. 12. The set is just her third to place on the list, and it marks her first appearance in five years. One Last Kiss is also Utada’s only project to not break into the top 10 on the tally, at least not yet.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/05/stray-kids-tomorrow-x-together-and-hikaru-utada-excitement-on-the-world-albums-chart/,"Stray Kids, Tomorrow X Together And Hikaru Utada: Excitement On The World Albums Chart"

(Photo by Ahmad SAHEL ARMAN / AFP) (Photo by AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) Massoud said in a Facebook post his organization agrees to “stop the war” and enter into “peaceful” negotiations with the Taliban if it “ends its military attacks and movements” in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, and a neighboring region. The statement comes amid reports of heavy fighting on Sunday in the mineral-rich region of Panjshir, the last of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces not to fall to the Taliban since the U.S. began its now-completed withdrawal of troops from the country last month. Massoud said there was “no legitimate, human or logical reason” for the Taliban to launch what he characterized as an illegal offensive in the holdout regions, where, he said, the people do not recognize the Taliban’s authority. Massoud is the son of an opposition commander who fought the Taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s, and he has allied with other anti-Taliban figures like Amrullah Saleh, the former vice president of Afghanistan who has declared himself acting president. The Taliban swept through Afghanistan last month as the U.S. prepared withdraw its remaining troops from the region, swiftly capturing the capital city of Kabul on August 14 and leaving Americans and Afghans who assisted the U.S. military scrambling to evacuate. The U.S. completed the withdrawal of troops on August 30. 100.

"Lars Ulrich performs on stage with Metallica during the ""WorldWired"" tour. Sunday, June 18, 2017 at ... [+] Soldier Field in Chicago, IL  In 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich ran a newspaper classified ad in search of like-minded musicians, citing English metal acts Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden for reference. The rest, as they say, is history. Vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield responded to it and Metallica was born. Today, the ad signifies the earliest days of a band that would go on to sell over 125 million albums, exposing thrash metal to a whole new audience as one of the most successful acts in rock history.  Since 2017, Metallica’s All Within My Hands Foundation has battled food insecurities while training skilled workers via the endowment of Metallica Scholars, a program which donated $1.6 million to 23 community colleges and tech schools this year. As Metallica stares down a once unthinkable 40 years, the metal icons have partnered with Carhartt to recreate Ulrich’s now legendary classified ad. The new campaign shines a light upon the importance of workforce education while recruiting a new generation of young fans to skilled trades. The work apparel manufacturer donated 100% of Labor Day online sales at the Carhartt website to All Within My Hands Foundation’s Metallica Scholars program, raising $377,450 on Monday. This Labor Day, thrash metal icons Metallica partner with Carhartt to shine a light on the ... [+] importance of workforce education via Metallica's All Within My Hands Foundation's Metallica Scholars program. It’s the beginning of a busy stretch for Metallica who are scheduled to return to the stage on Friday, September 23 and Sunday, September 26, 2021, rolling out a pair of unique sets in Louisville, Kentucky at Louder Than Life, the first of three U.S. festivals Metallica will perform at this fall in partnership with promoter Danny Wimmer Presents. Metallica is also celebrating the 30th anniversary of their most successful studio release, the 16x platinum Black Album, via a remastered edition available on CD, vinyl or as a limited edition deluxe box set. Available on September 10, 2021, the remaster accompanies the physical release of the Metallica Blacklist, an album which finds an incredibly diverse roster of 53 artists covering the Black Album’s dozen tracks, with all profits from the release split evenly between All Within My Hands Foundation and more than 50 other charities chosen by the artists taking part in the project.  I spoke with Lars Ulrich about recreating his 1981 classified ad, the importance of workforce education and curating the new Metallica Blacklist set. A transcript of our phone conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below.  One of the things I most respect about Metallica is that constant desire to look ahead not back. But recreating the ad does sort of force you to revisit the band’s literal earliest days. What’s it like doing that at a point like this 40 years in?  LARS ULRICH: That is definitely taking it back to the earliest moments!  It’s funny. Seeing the video and seeing the ad come to life warms my Danish heart. It’s sort of crazy on a parallel path that we’re just about 40 years into this in the next few months. Who would have thought that Metallica would exist 40 years later? Who would’ve thought that we would be in a place to have an opportunity to create a charitable organization like we have - to encourage the rock community to join us in giving back and rolling up their sleeves and getting their hands dirty. Who thought that Metallica could partner up with such an iconic American company like Carhartt and do something like this?  If you had said 40 years ago that I would be speaking to Forbes on Labor Day weekend, all of that would’ve seemed so preposterous. But here we are. And it’s not just a dream. But, again, seeing that video - seeing that ad come to life - who would’ve thought, right? After a period of record unemployment, how important is it to help train a new generation of young people to fill these skilled worker positions via the All Within My Hands Foundation Metallica Scholars? Ulrich: It’s important to highlight these issues. And I think that we feel that we have a niche where we can shed some light. And we obviously have a platform where we can help shout from the rooftops about these issues. The last year and a half in so many people’s lives, and the hardships that have come in the wake of that, it seems extra timely. We feel that there are so many other organizations that highlight an endless amount of worthy causes. And we’re so happy to be a small piece of that. But we feel that our niche with workforce education fits a significant amount of our fanbase. And, really, it’s about giving back to communities and to the fans themselves. So this is a big part of who the Metallica fanbase is all over the world.  We’re very proud of that and we’re very vocal about it. It’s great that we can make a little bit of a difference in bringing attention to these issues. And I just want to say that for our friends at Carhartt to step up and basically do 100% of the [online] proceeds for 24 hours on Labor Day - that’s pretty cool. It’s not just 100% of the profits, it’s 100% of everything generated from dollar one. That’s a commitment. And that’s a commitment to giving back and wanting to make a difference. This Labor Day, thrash metal icons Metallica partner with apparel manufacturer Carhartt to shine a ... [+] light upon the importance of workforce education via Metallica's All Within My Hands Foundation.  Something that really sets the Metallica Scholars program apart to me is its hyper focus on community colleges and tech schools. How important was it to get involved at that level? Ulrich: We’re five years into this now - five years into it in a public forum. We’ve been helping behind the scenes for years with food insecurities and working with local food banks all over the place when we’ve been playing. But, when we sat down and decided in 2016 to put an organization together and make this public, it was important to have a mission statement and figure out where we could make a difference. So we sat down and looked at what our passions were internally, within the group and the organization, and tried to balance that out with where there were places that we felt that we could make a difference.  I’m not saying that other organizations haven’t looked at workforce education but it felt like there definitely was something that we could contribute in that particular niche. It feels like an authentic extension of who a significant part of our fans are. And all four of us relate to people who need education just like all four of us in different situations have been at the receiving end of some challenges. So we’re just trying to make a difference at that level.  Metallica has always tried to be about transparency and authenticity and sort of try to do away with smokescreens. And this is real! What makes the world go round is a balance of all sorts of different things. But to be able to contribute and get more people out there with these types of skills feels like it’s a worthy cause. So we’re super psyched about the interest in it so far.  We’ve donated I believe over $4 million. And, like pretty much everything in Metallica, it feels like we’re just getting started. So lots of work to do and lots of places to make a difference - and lots of smiles on people’s faces as they understand that they can be a part of these programs.  And I’m super proud that the rock community can contribute. It’s great for the world to see that hard rock is fueled by the same passions and sense of community as other genres of music. And I’m super proud of the way that all of the fans have joined in and made this happen at their local level and at the national level and things like the workforce programs that we’re doing.  Lars Ulrich (left) and James Hetfield (right) perform on stage with Metallica during the ""World ... [+] Magnetic"" tour. Monday, January 26, 2009 at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, IL  Beyond the artists themselves, there are so many people impacted by the loss of live music amidst pandemic. You guys will be back on stage soon. What kind of impact have you seen the pandemic have amongst that community in your own camp and, after the last year and a half, how important is it to put these people back to work? Ulrich: A lot of people don’t understand the mechanics of the amount of people that are involved in these undertakings. Our partners at Live Nation put a charity together called Crew Nation that specifically helped all of the stagehands and everybody. A lot of people, when they go to a concert or sporting event or any type of big gathering, don’t really understand how many people are involved - from stagehands and drivers and ushers to all of these incredible people that just make stuff happen: scaffolding, stage sets and all of these crazy things.  We’ve done our part with the charity to help as much as we could in the last year and a half. And we’re very proud that we’ve been able to keep pretty much all of our people sort of engaged. We haven’t had to let anyone go. It’s been difficult. But we’ve dug deep and everybody has rolled up their sleeves to try and stay engaged. So we’re just like everybody else - just trying to do our part.  It’s been an unprecedented 18 months. And, as you know, we’re not out of the woods yet. It’s still a period of uncertainty. It’s a period of anxiety. It’s almost a day-to-day thing. Every morning when I look at my news sources, I see that so-and-so has cancelled and so-and-so has COVID or so-and-so is postponing and this event is being done away with… It’s crazy.  We’re supposed to start back up in a couple of weeks and fire the whole Metallica machine up. It’s definitely an uncertain time. We hope and pray every day that we can make it. We hope and pray that we can get back out there safely and that all of the people that make all of it happen - our incredible crew and everybody that we bring out: our touring crew, the local crew and local staff, all of the workers at the venues and all of the fans - stay safe and remain healthy.  Music makes such a difference in these times. And the power of music and the power of connectivity that comes in the wake of music is really amazing. It’s amazing what a difference it makes. And so we’re gonna have to find a way. What is the saying? The show must go on.  So - as long as the boundaries are set and safety is the paramount thing - if rock and roll can sort of exist within those safety measures, than I think we have to take it upon ourselves to go out and connect people to each other and to music and sort of keep it going. That’s important. Lars Ulrich performs on stage with Metallica during the ""WorldWired"" tour. Sunday, June 18, 2017 at ... [+] Soldier Field in Chicago, IL  How important was it with the Metallica Blacklist project to find a way to revisit the Black Album and embrace fan nostalgia a bit while still pushing the music forward in the process? Ulrich: Metallica started as a cover band. And Metallica still loves to engage in all things covers and other people’s music. And, over the years, there have been so many different groups and genres that have been respectful and have done some crazy cool covers of Metallica songs - from bluegrass to great lullabies to Korean death metal bands to incredible hip-hop and classical interpretations. Here’s somebody playing five Metallica songs on a hurdy-gurdy! Just an incredible range of stuff.  But we’ve never really encouraged any of that. We’ve been grateful and appreciative but this project, the Blacklist, is the first one that we’ve sort of curated where we thought about getting peers and other musicians and bands together that we respect and admire and that have been maybe on our radar as Metallica fans or who have been appreciative of what Metallica has done over the years. So far, to curate this for sort of the first time, and see this project come together… 53 songs strong! 53 incredible artists. That was crazier than anything we could have imagined. We didn’t anticipate we would get a response rate at this level. So it’s turned into a sizable project. But I think it’s one that’s going to have legs for some time as people discover all of this different music.  We encouraged everybody to just pick a song. We were not going to tell them which songs [to do]. And if five different people wind up doing [the same song], that’s fine. An incredible British artist named Sam Fender did a very, very sort of sparse and simple interpretation of the song “Sad But True.” Jason Isbell, who is also an incredible artist, has done it too. Many people have done “Sad But True.” But if you listen to those two back-to-back - Jason Isbell and Sam Fender’s takes on “Sad But True” - that is indicative of the kind of diversity that this project, to me, really signifies and what I’m proudest of.  I think that in 2021 to be able to cast a net that wide is so special. To have all of these artists from all of these different countries and genres and backgrounds take these 12 songs from the Black Album and make them all just sort of sound their own and give them their own stamp... And then sitting down as a group with 53 songs and sort of understanding the diversity and the scope of how varied all of that is, that just makes me super proud and super grateful. And I think to be able to hear the different interpretations of how different artists have sort of taken a Metallica song and turned it into something that’s completely their own, and that is completely different than what our original interpretation was, is crazy.  Kind of circling back to where we started, who the f—k would have imagined 40 years ago that that could even happen - that that type of thing was in the future. It’s pretty crazy.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimryan1/2021/09/05/lars-ulrich-on-metallicas-labor-day-support-of-workforce-education-new-blacklist-album/,"Lars Ulrich On Metallica’s Labor Day Support Of Workforce Education, New ‘Blacklist’ Album"
"The U.S.’s planned rollout of Covid-19 booster shots for the general public—initially slated to start September 20—remains up in the air pending approval from governmental regulators, but White House officials said Sunday at least Pfizer shots will likely be ready on time and the administration is prepared for a quick rollout whenever the shots are approved. A nurse marks a coronavirus vaccination card with a third ""booster"" dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 ... [+] vaccine on August 19 in Pasadena, California.  The Biden administration announced in mid-August that booster shots for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna recipients will start on September 20, but the New York Times reported this week that timeline may be in doubt, as the shots still have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledged on CBS’ Face the Nation it’s “conceivable” that only Pfizer’s shot will be approved by the 20th and Moderna’s shot will be delayed “at the most a couple of weeks,” as the FDA seeks more data from the company. Exactly who will be eligible for the booster shot will depend on the exact terms that are approved by the FDA and CDC, he said. Studies are underway on if people can “mix and match” booster doses—and get a Pfizer booster if their first two doses were of Moderna, for instance—but Fauci said the government is still “suggesting” as of now that people get a booster shot of the same vaccine as their initial dose. White House Chief of Staff Ronald Klain said on CNN the Biden administration is prepared to have booster shots available to the public “probably the very same day” as they’re approved, and the administration has adequate supply and a “distribution plan” to ensure widespread availability of the third shots when they’re ready to go. Fauci said last week health officials are sticking with the recommendation that people get a booster shot eight months after their second dose—after President Joe Biden suggested it could potentially be after six—though it ultimately depends on what the FDA and CDC determine is best. “We still are hopeful that at least one of the vaccinations could be available” on September 20 and the Biden administration is “ready to go as soon as the approval for the boosters comes,” Klain said on CNN, adding the FDA and CDC ultimately “will decide which of the vaccines are approved to be used as boosters.” “They will decide when that approval comes. They will decide who will get it under those approvals.” When booster shots for those who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, an adenovirus-based shot that uses a different technology than Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, will be approved. Federal health officials have said it’s “likely” that the one-dose vaccine will also require a booster shot, but they’re waiting until more data is in to make an official recommendation, including on whether the vaccine could be mixed with a booster shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Johnson & Johnson released data in late August suggesting a second shot of the vaccine produces a “rapid and robust increase” in antibodies that protect against the coronavirus, which could be a promising sign for the booster shot’s approval. The fact that booster shots haven’t been officially approved yet for the general population hasn’t stopped some people from getting them anyway, despite health officials advising against it. The delta variant surge has reportedly provoked many Americans to take it upon themselves to get a third shot, such as by making a vaccine appointment and claiming to be unvaccinated. An internal CDC document reported by ABC News on August 11 found an estimated 1.1 million people had already gotten an unauthorized booster shot, a figure the outlet notes is likely an undercount. Fauci’s acknowledgement of Moderna’s potential approval delay is in line with previous reporting suggesting Moderna’s shot may not be ready in time, with a source familiar with the approval process telling Forbes earlier this week that only Pfizer is expected to be ready for a September 17 FDA meeting on the booster shots. The holdup over Moderna’s vaccine approval is reportedly largely based on the booster shot’s dosage, as Moderna submitted data based on a lower 50 microgram dose but the FDA is reportedly seeking data on a 100 microgram dose equal to the initial shots of the vaccine. Pfizer’s approval process is also speedier in part because the company has substantial data from Israel’s booster shot rollout using its vaccine, the Associated Press reports. The U.S. has already approved third doses of the vaccines for immunocompromised groups that make up approximately 3% of the population, and the country’s planned booster rollout follows other countries like Israel, France, Germany and the Czech Republic that have started administering or plan to administer booster shots to at least some groups. The booster shots are a response to fears that the Covid-19 vaccines will wane in effectiveness as time goes on, which some studies have suggested is likely. The vaccines have also shown diminished effectiveness at preventing infection against the delta variant, though they still remain highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization and death.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized wealthy nations distributing booster shots before many countries around the world have even inoculated a large percentage of their population with initial doses. This is due to concerns about vaccine inequity, questions about the efficacy of booster shots and fears that more dangerous variants of the coronavirus could emerge from countries with low vaccination rates.

"There didn't seem to be a whole lot of face mask wearing or social distancing in this crowd during ... [+] Thursday night's Arizona State Sun Devils football game against the Southern Utah Thunderbirds at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. (Photo by Kevin Abele/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) On social media, people have been using the word “chills” to describe images of crowds packed into college football stadiums on Saturday. For example, the following tweet from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Network used “ABSOLUTE CHILLS” when referring to footage of Virginia Tech hosting the University of North Carolina: And this tweet about the University of Wisconsin versus Penn State game mentioned “chills” as well:  Note that the tweet said “if this doesn’t give you chills, you don’t have a pulse,” and not “if this doesn’t give your diarrhea, fever, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or loss of taste or smell, you don’t have a pulse.” With the more contagious Delta variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus spreading throughout the U.S., the concern is that a packed football stadium without much social distancing and with little face mask use could become essentially a “Delta house.” In fact, could the “return of college football” be like pouring kerosene on a fire and adding fuel to the current Covid-19 coronavirus surge in the U.S.? That could end up giving many, many more people “chills” in a bad, bad way. Since the end of June, the seven-day average of new reported Covid-19 cases per day has continued to rise, going from just under 11,0oo to over 160,000, according to the New York Times.  That’s basically going from a basketball arena’s worth of people to two big football stadiums. And this hasn’t been simply a “more people getting the sniffles” situation. The number of Covid-19 related deaths reported each day has risen by more than five-fold since the beginning of August.  Last Saturday, August 28, UCLA Bruins cheerleaders wore face masks prior to a NCAA Football game ... [+] between the UCLA Bruins and the Hawaii Warriors at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Yet, yesterday, many on the field and in the stands were not wearing face masks. (Photo by Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images) Before you say, but the vaccine is making us free, keep in mind that only 53% of the total U.S. population is fully vaccinated. In other words, the figurative swimming pool that you are in essentially has plenty of people swimming around without wearing anything and singing “free to pee, free to pee.”  Moreover, the Covid-19 vaccines are not full body concrete condoms. They do not offer 100% protection. You can still catch and transmit the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) even after being fully vaccinated, although your risk of having more severe Covid-19 would be much lower.  So what’s the best way to control this latest pandemic surge in the U.S.? Somehow having thousands of people yell together for about two hours doesn’t seem like the first answer. Or the second. Or the five thousand, nine hundred, and twenty third answer. In fact, assembling such large crowds across the country every week seems about as counterintuitive as putting “really likes drama” or “can’t pay the water bill so don’t regularly shower” on your dating profile.  Arkansas Razorbacks fans filled Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium for a game against the Rice ... [+] Owls on September 4, 2021 in Fayetteville, Arkansas. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images) Plus, having such large crowds may send the wrong message, a “premature relaxation” message. And as you know, anything premature could end up being very messy and very disappointing, and prompt answers like “this has never happened before, honestly.” But premature relaxation has happened during this pandemic.  Just look at this past Spring when face mask wearing and social distancing were prematurely relaxed as I warned for Forbes back in May. Sure you can blame the more contagious Delta variant for the mid-Summer surge. But that can be like blaming the Delta fraternity in the movie Animal House for the Germans bombing Pearl Harbor. The Delta variant may not have spread so readily and rapidly had people been more diligent about Covid-19 precautions.  Moreover, this latest surge seems to be affecting younger folks a lot more than the surges in 2020. For example, an analysis published on Friday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) found that rates of Covid-19-related hospitalizations among children and adolescents “rose nearly five-fold during late June–mid-August 2021.” That made the routine wave that University of Iowa fans offered to the Children’s Hospital behind the stadium yesterday a bit unsettling:  The hope is that this wave wasn’t like, “hey look, we are spreading the Covid-19 coronavirus just for you.” During this ongoing pandemic, the best way to help kids, especially those hospitalized with weaker immune systems, is to wear face masks and practice social distancing. Mass gathering events like the Lollapalooza music festival and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which I covered previously for Forbes, could easily become superspreader events. The one saving grace is that these are one-time, one-location events. They don’t happen every single week.  College football games, though, are different. They are going to happen every freaking weekend. They are going to occur throughout many different parts of country. And they are going to keep on keeping on well into the Fall.  Showing teeming stadiums of college students and others cheering their hearts out may seem inspirational and make it feel like things are back to normal. But that will only gloss over the fact that the virus is still spreading in a relatively uncontrolled manner. Hospitals are still full. Healthcare workers are exhausted. People are getting sick and dying. It can be like putting “lipstick on a pig,” when mascara and some Ugg boots are much better ideas. While college football teams like OU, MSU, and FSU gear up to play in front of packed stadiums, will the Covid-19 coronavirus be preparing to say a big you-know-what-U to the entire country this Fall?

"CM Punk passed on a WWE return due to the company ""playing games."" While CM Punk is lighting the wrestling world on fire following his debut in AEW, he did have to pass on a WWE return in order to make it happen. During an interview with ESPN’s Marc Raimondi, Punk revealed that while there were discussions between himself and his former employer, things never came to fruition due to WWE “playing games.” “I remember one of the first things I ever said to them was, ‘Above all, don’t play games.’ And they played games,” said Punk. “Some things never change. … When you enter a conversation with people you have a past with and you know who they are, how seriously can you take it? I know exactly who they are and they just continue to prove it. I’m trying to be as diplomatic as I possibly can.” Punk made his long-awaited AEW debut on the company’s new Friday night show Rampage on August 20. He is scheduled to face Darby Allin on AEW’s All Out PPV on Sunday night. It’ll be his first match since WWE’s Royal Rumble back in 2014. It was shortly thereafter that Punk walked away from the WWE — and professional wrestling altogether — until his recent return. Prior to signing a contract with AEW, Punk-to-WWE rumors had run rampant since he was signed on to be an on-air personality for FOX 1’s WWE Backstage. Although he was a FOX employee — not a WWE one — the connection led to many believing a return to the WWE would come sooner rather than later. As Punk notes, that reunion never occurred. WWE had reached out to him about a return through intermediaries, but discussions never really “got off the ground.” Furthermore, Punk implies during the interview that the WWE offered him more money for his return. But while he wants to be well-compensated, it’s not the reason why he returned. ""What I mean is, it's not all about the money for me,"" Punk said. ""Because if it was, I would have probably been the main event of WrestleMania this past year. Or I would have been at the Royal Rumble. Everybody is different. Every situation is different. There's some people that don't like me, so all they're going to hear is 'Oh, he's just doing it for the money.' And I could give a s—-.” All things considered, Punk likely made the right move. In AEW, he will be featured in the marquee match at “All Out” in his hometown of Chicago. Considering his mega star status, AEW has done a fantastic job of debuting Punk. It’s no secret that AEW’s numbers skyrocketed in Punk’s debut on Rampage and during his ensuing appearance on Dynamite for the first time. The second episode of Rampage drew 1.129 million viewers and 692,00 viewers in the 18-49 demographic. The 692,00 viewers were the second-highest the young company has drawn since its inception, with only the debut episode of Dynamite drawing higher numbers. Punk’s first appearance on Dynamite drew 1.172 million viewers and 620,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic — the second-highest in the show’s history.  That’s not even mentioning Punk shattered the record for the highest-selling design at Pro Wrestling Tee, featuring the shirt he wore upon his AEW debut.  While the WWE is a different landscape compared to Punk’s last appearance seven years ago, his decision to sign with AEW presents multiple opportunities for him to wrestle against new superstars. And as negative as it may sound, the WWE likely wouldn’t have capitalized on the magnitude of Punk’s return in the long run. He likely would have been lost in the shuffle — as so many of WWE’s top stars suffer through these days due to wishy-washy booking.” You also can’t ignore the rough background history of both parties. Punk and the WWE were caught up in lawsuits in recent years since his departure and he did walk out on the company. After years of waiting, wrestling fans can finally see Punk in the squared circle again with a new company and fresh opponents. ""The proof is in the pudding. Does it matter why I'm doing it? Do you really care? If you don't like me, don't watch,” Punk says. “It's a perfect storm. It's a lot of everything. It's the money, it's the freedom. It's the creative, and it's the possibility of working with young, talented people that excite me.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2021/09/05/cm-punk-on-why-he-passed-on-wwe-return-says-they-played-games/,"CM Punk On Why He Passed On WWE Return, Says They ‘Played Games’"
"Models walking at Pyer Moss' runway during New York Fashion Week, September 2019. The Covid-19 ... [+] pandemic sidelined live shows last year. (Photo by Fernanda Calfat/Getty Images) The Fashion Group International has a long history of providing business-to-business information to its members, dating back to the Thirties, when the professional association was founded. Tomorrow, it will return to its roots with Communiqué, a daily summary with photos and synopses of select New York Fashion Week runway shows, trends and news. The organization wants to be the eyes and ears of the fashion industry for its global membership. That’s more important than ever this season, the first since last year when the Covid-19 pandemic began, with a return to live events in New York City.  The Fashion Group knows that retailers and buyers may be hard-pressed to travel to Manhattan and its environs as the Delta variant rears its head. Among the 91 designers showing next week will be Gabriela Hearst, Proenza Schouler, LaQuan Smith, Rodarte, Michael Kors, threeASFOUR, Rosetta Getty and Tom Ford.  “FGI has a history all the way back to the Thirties, when we provided business-to-business information,” said Maryann Grisz, president and CEO of the professional organization. “We have minutes in our archives from board meetings from 1936, on. The members were actually talking about [providing] this type of information.” Grisz said that over the years, FGI has produced written reports and video presentations about the presentation of collections, and that Marylou Luther, a legacy member, for many years penned trend reports. “Through the pandemic, there’s been so much creativity,” Grisz said. “We felt it was important to acknowledge what’s happening in fashion in a timely way. We’ll have highlights, influences, color stories and new designers. I’ll be attending some of the shows and we’ll be reviewing photography from all of the events.” Sharon Graubard, founder and creative director of Mint Moda and Nicole Fischelis, fashion and art forecasting and FGI board member, established industry experts, will curate the report, capturing highlight influences, directional and significant style, color and uncovering new talent presented during New York Fashion Week collections. Hair expert Frédéric Fekkai will be reporting from the trenches and discussing what’s trending for fall from his perspective, while Gary Wassner, CEO of Hildun Corp., will be reporting on new talent and profiling a designer each day, as someone to watch. The missive will be sent to members’ inboxes at 11 pm every night of New York Fashion Week “to make sure we include everything,” Grisz said.  The report is sponsored by Frederic Fekkai, Hildum and California retailer Elyse Walker. “Being FGI, we need to have somewhat of a presence during fashion week,” said Fischelis. “I thought it was a good idea to do a daily recap, just to talk about key ideas, key looks and key silhouettes, whether it’s a designer or a trend that we see as a through-line by different designers.  “We’ll have daily fashion news,” Fischelis added. “Gary’s company is a factoring company, and it’s a family business. He’s been going to fashion shows for years and helps a lot of companies. It’s going to be very interesting to get his point of view.”  Several New York-based designers who’ve recently been showing in Europe, will present collections in New York this season, Fischelis said, citing Thom Browne and Jeremy Scott for Moschino, which are returning to lend their support for American fashion. “The buyers need to be on top of the trends. They need to reassess,” Fischelis said, referring to the changes wrought by the pandemic that has consumers dressing in more casual attire. “Designers are creating a new environment and excitement. Incorporating art and fashion is a rising trend. We’ve seen it emerging very strongly because there were so many static presentations.” “In today’s world there are no singular hair trends per se,” Fekkai told me. “There are many ways people can celebrate their unique hair type in a way that reflects their personality, style, and culture. I’m honored to be a part of FGI’s Communiqué and excited to share my observations of what we experience with our customers with the FGI members.” “I’m going to choose one relatively new designer each day of fashion week whom I think has great potential,” said Wassner. “In 100 words or less, I’m going to give them a shout out, describe what they’re about. “FGI is a global organization,” Wassner added. “Many of its members don’t have access to the runways. Information is king these days, so we’re hoping to provide insights and comments on the trends for the season, culled from attendance at all the shows during NYFW. One walks away from a live show with a very different sense of the brand they’ve seen, compared to watching a live stream or perusing a look book preview.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/09/05/the-fashion-group-international-wants-to-be-eyes-and-ears-of-nyfw-for-global-members/,The Fashion Group International Wants To Be Eyes And Ears Of NYFW For Global Members
"Argo AI's sensors and software are integrated into a test fleet of electric VW ID. BUZZ vans that will be tested in Munich.  Argo AI, the autonomous driving startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, is readying modified electric VW vans that will eventually be used for a commercial robotaxi service in Germany operated with European ride service MOIA by 2025.  Argo and Volkswagen’s commercial vehicle arm showed off what they said is the first of five ID. BUZZ vans that will be part of a test fleet ahead of the start of this week’s IAA auto and mobility show in Munich. Tests of the battery-powered vehicles outfitted with Argo’s laser lidar sensors, radar, cameras and AI-enabled software will be done with Volkswagen at Argo’s R&D facility and test track near Munich. Within four years the companies intend to start picking up passengers using MOIA’s ride-hailing platform in Hamburg.  “Building on our five years of development and learnings from our operations in large, complex U.S. cities, we are excited to soon begin testing on the streets of Munich in preparation for the launch of the self-driving commercial ride-pooling service with MOIA,” Bryan Salesky, Argo’s founder and CEO, said in a statement. Argo’s German plans come as the tech startup, which is competing with Alphabet’s Waymo, GM-backed Cruise and other self-driving developers to commercialize autonomous driving, ramps up road tests in the U.S. in partnership with Ford and Lyft. The company is preparing to begin picking up paying passengers this year in autonomous Ford vehicles in Miami and Austin using Lyft’s ride-hail network, albeit with backup human safety drivers initially. Already among the best-funded autonomous driving companies, having raised at least $2.6 billion from Ford and Volkswagen, Salesky has said Argo plans to further boost its funding with a public stock listing.  MOIA operates Europe's largest, electric ride-hailing service and “Hamburg will be the first city to offer an autonomous ride-pooling service with an ID.

Shenzhen-headquartered BYD sold 61,409 new electric vehicles last month, compared with 15,283 a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Friday evening.  For the first eight months of the year, it sold 266,480 new energy vehicles, an increase of 192.6% from a year earlier. The Chinese electric vehicle industry pioneer is up against a global chip shortage and intensifying competition from local newcomers such as NIO and XPeng as well as from China-invested Tesla. Net profit in the first six months of the year at BYD fell by 29% to 1.17 billion yuan, or $180 million, amid rising material costs, the company said last month. Revenue increased by 53.6% to 89.1 billion yuan.

Blinken is expected to take questions about the Biden administration's priorities for U.S. foreign policy. (Photo by Ting Shen-Pool/Getty Images) Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) claimed in a Fox News Sunday interview that six planes have been sitting at the Mazar-i-Sharif international airport “for the last couple of days,” information that appears to come from a State Department email to members of Congress. McCaul suggested the flights are being held hostage until the U.S. recognizes the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate governing power, as it now controls the vast majority of the country, but U.S. officials have thus far declined to do so. The State Department told lawmakers the flights will have permission to depart for Doha, Qatar – where the U.S. has been processing Afghans applying for special immigrant visas – ”if and when the Taliban agrees to takeoff,” according to CBS News. Marina LeGree, the executive director of Ascend, an NGO that offers young women “athletics-based leadership training,” told Forbes she knows of between 600 and 1200 people including 19 U.S. citizens and 2 green card holders waiting nearby the airport, but that there are “probably more.” LeGree said the group includes female mountaineers, NGO workers, journalist and women at risk, and that her understanding is the Taliban is negotiating with Afghan airline Kam Air over price – though she added, “For 6 days, who knows.” A State Department spokesperson told Forbes they lack a “reliable means to confirm the basic details of charter flights” because of the absence of U.S. personnel on the ground. “More and more people are coming, some of whom are not on the manifest but are paying a bribe to the gatekeepers. Conditions are deteriorating,” LeGree told Forbes. 0. That’s how many Americans and Afghan allies have departed Afghanistan since U.S. troops finished their withdrawal from the region last Monday, McCaul said in the interview. Biden has taken significant heat from some lawmakers for completing the withdrawal of troops on schedule even as some Americans were still trying to evacuate. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said in a CNN interview Sunday around 100 Americans remain in the country, but expressed hope commercial flights out of the country will resume “in the coming days.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/05/top-house-republican-says-taliban-holding-6-planes-with-americans-afghans-hostage/,"Top House Republican Says Taliban Holding 6 Planes With Americans, Afghans ‘Hostage’"
"Annabelle Wallis in James Wan's 'Malignant.' In weekend box office news that isn’t about Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, James Wan’s Malignant opened overseas in advance of its domestic debut. The R-rated original horror flick, essentially Wan’s “one for me” flick after Aquaman nabbed $1.148 billion worldwide, earned $2.4 million in 24 territories representing 38% of the overseas footprint. It nabbed $595,000 in Spain (+62% ahead of Candyman), $515,000 in France (10% ahead of Escape Room 2) and $200,000 in Italy (+83% higher than Candyman). The supernatural murder mystery, starring Annabelle Wallis in a kind of “Drop Dead Fred but with folks actually dropping dead” genre offering, opens domestically this Friday. Fingers-crossed, but otherwise I’m guessing if things go awry that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will make up the difference.  FREE GUY Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer’s Free Guy earned another $8.7 million (-33%) domestic in its third Fri-Sun frame. That sets the stage for a $11.2 million Fri-Mon gross and a $95 million 18-day cume. Moreover, it fell just 22% in China for an $18.6 million weekend and $57 million ten-day cume. As frankly predicted, China is relishing the video game-specific and American pop culture-inspired fantasy/comedy/romance, again showing that a China with plenty of local tentpoles prefer genuinely “foreign” films when it comes to selecting an export title. See also: Zootopia, Ready Player One and Green Book. It’ll pass Avatar ($57.6 million) and Soul ($57.9 million) tomorrow to stand behind only Tenet ($66 million), Godzilla Vs. Kong ($188 million) and F9 ($216 million) among Hollywood exports in 2020 and 2021.  Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt's 'Jungle Cruise' The film has amassed $239.2 million worldwide thus far. Covid or no Covid, $300 million-plus for an over/under $115 million, original, star-driven high-concept flick is an absolute win. I’d have been happy with such a result even in conventional circumstances. We can debate the complicated issues at play with Disney moving forward with a Jungle Cruise sequel. The legs are great and it’ll have $107 million domestic tomorrow after a 24% drop in weekend six, but the Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt flick will barely top $200 million in global theatrical earnings (plus whatever it made on Disney+ Premier Access). Free Guy getting an eventual/likely sequel needs no detailed explanation other than “well-liked movie with fun characters made money in theaters.” It sounds so quaint and old-fashioned when I saw it out loud. Michael Hargrove as Sherman Fields in Candyman, directed by Nia DaCosta. Universal’s Candyman took a somewhat expected drop, earning a $10.5 million (-54%) Fri-Sun and $13.26 million Fri-Mon second-weekend gross. The $25 million Nia DaCosta-directed horror sequel will have $42 million in 11 days and has earned $50 million worldwide. So far, so good. Paramount’s Paw Patrol (concurrently available on Paramount+) will earn $5.62 million over the holiday for a $31 million domestic and $62 million worldwide cume. That’s good enough on a $26 million budget. Sony’s Don’t Breathe 2 has earned $28 million domestic and $40 million worldwide on a $10 million budget, even as its predecessor earned $155 million five years ago. The Suicide Squad will earn $1 million over the Fri-Mon holiday for a $54.5 million 31-day domestic and $162 million worldwide cume as it exits HBO Max.  Dev Patel in The Green Knight Black Widow will be just under $183 million domestic by tomorrow right as F9 is passing $173 million domestic (and $710 million worldwide). The Night House will have $6.4 million after 18 days following a $650,000 Fri-Mon frame as M. Night Shyamalan’s Old will earn $590,000 over the holiday for a $47.4 million (domestic and $85 million worldwide cume on an $18 million budget. Martin Campbell’s The Protégé will earn $720,000 over the Fri-Mon frame for a $7 million 18-day cume. Space Jam: A New Legacy will cross $70 million this weekend while A24’s The Green Knight will end Labor Day just over $17 million. Poor, under-loved Reminiscence will earn $47,000 (-94%) in its third Fri-Sun frame for a $3.85 million cume. Pity WB again missing out by overestimating the taste of the American moviegoer.  CHRIS PRATT, EDWIN HODGE, and SAM RICHARDSON stars in THE TOMORROW WAR Last but not least, Skydance’s The Tomorrow War opened in China after playing in most of the world as an Amazon Prime title. The Chris McKay-directed/Chris Pratt-starring sci-fi original, about present-day citizens zipped into the future to provide cannon fodder for a losing war against extraterrestrial invaders, was one of the very best blockbuster-y movies we got this summer, so grim irony that the “intended to be released theatrically by Paramount” flick ended up as a streaming premiere. Of course, high-concept, star-driven originals struggled before Covid, and Tomorrow War is no exception. The film earned a “meh” $8.2 million opening weekend, unable to fend off the leggy and buzzy Free Guy. I would imagine that Skydance looks at any China box office as gravy, but it would have been nice to see it break out somewhere.

"Golden State Warriors General Manager Bob Myers faces a tricky task in adding talent around their ... [+] salary cap limitations. Rookie-scale contracts will help, but there are other options. The Golden State Warriors will enter the 21-22 NBA season with the largest payroll and luxury tax bill of any team in NBA history. The Warriors have never shied away from spending big in their efforts to win, but the costs are now eye-watering and their salary cap limitations are beginning to bite. It was the luxury tax implications of using their taxpayer Mid Level Exception that saw the Warriors lose out on Paul Millsap, who signed with the Brooklyn Nets this week despite some heavy Golden State interest in free agency. At the same time the Warriors are reluctant to engage in any superstar trade discussions that involve their recent lottery picks, Jonathan Kuminga and James Wiseman. So are the Warriors stuck with the roster they have now for the foreseeable future? Well, despite the salary cap limits they face, there are still some options at Golden State’s disposal to upgrade their roster. The Warriors’ salary cap position represents the inevitable cost of trying to maintain a dynasty over many years. Players who were once on rookie contracts and value extensions are now being compensated handsomely for past glories. There’s no better example of the life-cycle of NBA contracts than Stephen Curry, who just became the first player in NBA history to sign multiple $200m+ extensions. The Warriors dynasty was built off the back of his ludicrously underpriced 4-year $44m contract extension that kicked in in 2013-14. He will make more money than that in this season alone.  Added to that, the Warriors have now spent enough time over the NBA’s luxury tax thresholds to enter the “repeater tax”. The extra dollar multiplier on the luxury tax bills layers on the punishment for any team that tries to pay for a high level of success over any extended period.  The table below demonstrates the results. This season they’re at almost $350m. Next season if they re-sign their key free agents they could break the $400m barrier, a level that General Manager Bob Myers has stated they do not want to breach. They’re so far over the cap that even when Andrew Wiggins’ notorious contract expires in 2023 the Warriors would still be in the luxury tax even if they don’t re-sign him.  The Golden State Warriors can’t actually create any cap space until the summer of 2024, and that’s only if they let franchise legends Klay Thompson and Draymond Green walk away. And once James Wiseman’s $30m cap hold is included, they’d only have a measly $36,699 of cap room (and no, that figure is not missing a bunch of zeroes). That’s unlikely to even be enough for a game-ticket at one of the executive suites at Chase Center. It’s worth stating that this illustrative table assumes that:   Different decisions could present some different possibilities, but the basic underlying message remains the same. The Golden State Warriors are capped out for the remainder of their run whatever they do.  This inevitably creates challenges that the Warriors will have to navigate when building out their roster. In salary cap terms their best option is to find players who can outperform their contracts over the next few seasons.  That’s why their young crop of prospects on rookie scale contracts is so important - starting that cycle again is most likely to produce the desired results. With three recent lottery picks, and Jordan Poole coming off an encouraging season, the Warriors have a real headstart here. Poole has two years before they have to think about really paying for the value he might produce, Wiseman has three years, Kuminga and Moses Moody have a full four years on cheap, cost-controlled deals. The Warriors also have their own first-round picks in the 2022 and 2023 drafts. The other option is to seek to cash in some of those assets in a trade. But the Warriors still face the fact that the asking price for any star players on the market is influenced by the stock of assets Golden State is sitting on. Teams are asking for the world for players that aren’t quite the sort of superstar material the Warriors might actually be interested in, and the Warriors aren’t desperate enough to make that sort of deal.  Indeed, that’s doubly the case since Kuminga and Moody dropped to them in the draft, a rare case of draft picks actually increasing in value after they’ve been used. Add in the fact that once the picks have been used and contracts signed matching salary will have to come back in any trade, and the financial incentives to make a deal that might have existed before the draft evaporate. This partly explains their present reluctance to engage in any serious trade discussions, though some of that is also the lack of any bona fide star to discuss. The Warriors trade options though aren’t just reduced to finding a disgruntled superstar and throwing in all their assets. One of the difficulties the Warriors have had for some time is a lack of mid-tier contracts to use in trades for an established veteran who isn’t a star. They’ve typically had an extreme distribution on their salary cap of players on big deals and veterans on minimums, or rookies drafted late on with very low salaries.  But the tide may be turning a little here. They do now have several players on contracts above the minimum that they could aggregate up into matching salary once post-signing restrictions expire. For example, the salaries of Kevon Looney, Moody, and Damion Lee together could bring back a contract in the range of $12-13m. Throw in one of their future draft picks and that could be a pretty attractive package for another team at the trade deadline. Players in that salary range include Josef Nurkic and Robert Covington on the Portland Trailblazers, Joe Ingles on the Utah Jazz, and perhaps most intriguingly Houston Rockets’ big man Christian Wood (if they throw in another minimum contract). All veterans who could help them win games over the next few years. Whether or not any of those players are worth that package is yet to be seen. But the principle is there. The presence of a few contracts above the veteran minimum opens up avenues to upgrade talent without selling low on Kuminga or Wiseman. The Warriors offseason is largely complete following the value signings of Andre Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr, and Nemanja Bjelica. But they do still have some flexibility at the back-end of their roster.  At present their roster consists of 13 guaranteed contracts, Damion Lee on a partial guarantee, and Mychal Mulder and Gary Payton II on non-guaranteed deals. Lee is probably safe given his fit with the team and a clear need for some depth at the shooting guard position with Klay Thompson not expected back until Christmas. That still leaves one spot that could be opened up. The Warriors best option for that final spot may well be the buyout market. After missing out on Millsap they could use another veteran big. But so far Kevin Love, a hot topic of buyout rumors, has denied any such conversations with the Cavaliers. How long that stance lasts when training camp opens and the reality of two more years on a rebuilding Cleveland team hits is anybody’s guess though. The most intriguing option is if Marc Gasol hits the market after a bumpy year with the Lakers. The Warriors were close to securing him last offseason, and with the Lakers adding Dwight Howard and Deandre Jordan, Gasol’s days in Los Angeles may well be numbered. There’s no question he’d be both a fantastic fit with his defensive IQ, passing ability, and three-point shooting, and a great mentor for Wiseman.  The Warriors have previously used this sort of flexibility on the back end of their roster to host a competition in their training camp. The immediate candidates are Payton II and Mulder.  Payton II has two arguments in his favor. Firstly he’s a much better defender than Mulder and can credibly plug one of the Warriors remaining holes as a perimeter defender in the backcourt. Secondly, unlike Payton II, Mulder is eligible for a two-way contract as he only has two years service. This means the Warriors could waive him, and provided he passes through the waiver process, sign him to one of their vacant two-way spots. Important rule changes on two-way contracts from last season have been retained, such as players being able to spend unlimited days with their NBA team and a maximum 50-game limit, mean that those spots do offer quite a bit of value to NBA teams now. There is a third contender emerging however. The Warriors have reportedly been working out Darren Collison after his unexpected retirement from the NBA two seasons ago. When he was last seen in the NBA, Collison was exactly what the Warriors need. He’s a very serviceable backup point guard who can shoot, create, and defend. If he’s still got some juice in his legs, then he could be the final piece of the puzzle for the Warriors. Golden State do have some form in successful reclamation projects, perhaps most famously demonstrated in resurrecting JaVale McGee’s career. If both Collison and Gasol were available the Warriors could waive Lee to create the room to sign both, and use Mulder on a two-way contract to provide the backcourt depth they need. But even one of those two veterans would be an instant upgrade to their depth this season. Then at the trade deadline once they have a clearer picture of how far along they are, they can consider the different trade options at their disposal. So as capped out as the Golden State Warriors may be, they do still have some good options at their disposal.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmurray/2021/09/05/golden-state-warriors-have-options-despite-salary-cap-limits/,Golden State Warriors Have Options Despite Salary Cap Limits
"Several Republicans including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) criticized Texas’ near-total ban on abortion Sunday because of its provision empowering private citizens to sue those who aid and abet abortions—potentially signaling the legal tactic could face resistance from within the GOP as more states plan to copy Texas’ law. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, holds a news conference on August 5 in Annapolis, Maryland. ... [+]  Hogan said on Meet the Press Sunday that despite being “personally opposed to abortion” and believing in some state-level restrictions, the Texas law “seems to be a little bit extreme.” The Maryland governor specifically pointed to the law’s “problem of bounties,” as the Texas law—known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8)—says government officials cannot enforce the law, but rather directs private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who “aids and abets” an abortion and stipulates they can earn at least $10,000 in damages if they win. Kinzinger said on CNN that while he’s “pro-life,” what he “doesn’t like to see” is letting “everyone being able to tattle” and the fact that under SB 8, private citizens are “deputized to enforce this abortion law” against even potentially Uber drivers that transport a Texan to their abortion. The GOP lawmaker also opposes the fact the law does not include exceptions in the case of rape and incest, though SB 8 does allow abortions in the case of medical emergencies. Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who identifies as “pro-life,” said on Meet the Press she views the Texas law as “bad policy and it’s bad law,” agreeing with a Wall Street Journal op-ed that described the law as a “blunder” that “sets an awful precedent that conservatives should hate.” Abortion is “a debate that we should have that’s open and not just opening people up to be sued for any bit part in that process,” Kinzinger said, adding that any future abortion laws should take the rape and incest exceptions into account and “should certainly not be set up so that it’s enforced by people using private right of action to sue somebody.” Though some are expressing reservations, many in the GOP have celebrated SB 8 and the U.S. Supreme Court declining to strike the law down. The Supreme Court’s decision “sav[ed] countless innocent lives,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted, while Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) called the ruling a “major win for human rights” and Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) said the decision was “incredibly encouraging.” “I am even prouder than usual to be a Texan today,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said in a statement Wednesday after the law went into effect. SB 8 prohibits physicians from performing abortions after a “fetal heartbeat” is detected—a term the medical community has decried as factually misleading—which is typically around six weeks into a pregnancy. That’s before many people know they’re pregnant, experts say, and abortion advocacy groups project the law is expected to stop approximately 85% of abortions in the state, marking the most extreme abortion restrictions to go into effect in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade in 1973. Abortion providers in Texas told reporters Wednesday they’re remaining open but now stopped performing abortions after that milestone in compliance with the law, causing those in Texas seeking abortions to now travel potentially up to 20 times as far to obtain one, according to the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute. The U.S. Supreme Court was asked to block the law from going into effect but ultimately declined to do so, ruling 5-4 late Wednesday night it was too soon to bring a lawsuit against the law. A state court in Texas did issue a more narrow ruling that temporarily blocks anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, which helped draft SB 8, from enforcing SB 8 against Planned Parenthood and its staff. More states are expected to follow in Texas’ footsteps and attempt to pass legislation that mimics SB 8. Lawmakers in states including Florida, North Dakota, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Dakota and Indiana have signaled their intentions to try and pass similar bills, and John Seago, the legislative director of Texas Right to Life, told Forbes Thursday he was personally working with three states on their own legislation. The federal government is also taking action to counteract the Texas law: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the chamber will take up a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would enshrine the right to an abortion in federal law, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on the Senate on CNN Sunday to abolish the filibuster so that the Senate can pass the bill. President Joe Biden has also directed his administration to undertake a “whole-of-government effort” to try and fight the law, with White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain saying on CNN Sunday the administration was “looking for legal remedies” against the law and was “going to find ways if they are at all possible, and I think they are possible.” The Supreme Court’s decision in favor of the Texas law has also spurred a new push among Democrats for reforms to the high court—something the Biden administration has already been investigating through a new commission—including expanding the court and imposing term limits. Klobuchar said Sunday the 5-4 ruling is also further reason for liberal-leaning Justice Stephen Breyer to retire and ensure he can be replaced by a Democratic president. “If this decision doesn’t cry out for that, I don’t know what does,” Klobuchar said.

"NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA - AUGUST 30: A building was destroyed after Hurricane Ida passed through on ... [+] August 30, 2021 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane yesterday in Louisiana and brought flooding and wind damage along the Gulf Coast (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) About three years ago, Entergy Corp. admitted that actors had testified before the New Orleans City Council on its behalf, although a third party had hired and paid them without its knowledge. The utility had asked to build a gas-fired “peaking plant” to prevent mass outages during hurricanes. The whole episode was a farce, made even worse because the lights remain out after Hurricane Ida swept through.  A peaking plant, which is used to meet those times when the electricity demand is excessively high, still needs long-distance, high-powered transmission lines. And while the 128-megawatt generation unit may do its job during hot and sticky summer days, it failed to do its thing during Hurricane Ida, which hit 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina wiped out the city. Entergy is still assessing the damages while 1 million-plus have been without power.  All this begs the question as to why Entergy and New Orleans didn’t follow the lead of New York State and California after Superstorm Sandy and a host of wildfires ravaged their respective communities. Those states now rely more on distributed energy assets such as onsite generation, battery storage, and localized microgrids that can deliver power to buildings or campuses. Collectively, they can alleviate the strain on the main grid and especially during extreme weather events. California’s grid operator calls distributed energy resources “absolutely critical.”  “Entergy shoehorned this $210 million peaking power plant through the city council,” says Gregg Dixon, chief executive of Voltus in Boston, in an interview. “We need local power to provide emergency electricity now that these climate change events are getting worse and worse. This plant was commission about a year ago and it failed. It failed miserably. If the transmission lines are taken out, then a power plant is useless. Microgrids and virtual power plants are much less susceptible to hurricanes. They provide resiliency and reliability.”  To be clear, there are two types of electric generating units: the first involves “induction,” which gets the voltage it needs by being interconnected to the grid; voltage is what pushes the electrons through the wires. The second is a “black start” generator that can “excite” itself to create the needed voltage. That is what Entergy built. But again, without working transmission lines, the added cost is wasted. In other words, even if Entergy’s “black start” generator could have powered up, it still couldn’t send the electrons to homes and businesses.  Measuring Value A house shown in the distance is powered by Pacific Gas & Electric's new Remote Grid Initiative site ... [+] shown near Yosemite National Park in Briceburg, Calif., on June 7, 2021. When a wildfire tore through Briceburg nearly two years earlier, the tiny community on the edge of Yosemite National Park lost the only power line connecting it to the electrical grid. Rather than rebuilding poles and wires over increasingly dry hillsides, which could increase the risk of equipment igniting catastrophic fires, the nation's largest utility decided to give Briceburg a self-reliant power system. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian) As for New Orleans, it has eight transmission lines that feed into the city. But Ida knocked out all of them. The city also hosts about 200 megawatts of onsite generators that are used to keep such enterprises as hospitals, industrial sites, and its convention center operating during mass outages. What Voltus does is to take the onsite generation, battery storage, and demand response and configure them with its software program to form a virtual power plant. Let’s explain:  It is simply the orchestration of millions of dispersed assets to manage the supply of electricity — power that can be redirected back to the local distribution grid and transported to homes and businesses. It’s a technology that can also be used to defer investments in expensive capital projects, such as peaking plants. Think of it this way: A centralized coal-fired unit may have a generating capacity of 1,000 megawatts of electricity. It is also connected to a long-distance transmission network, all of which make it susceptible to cyberattacks or natural disasters. But a distributed energy system, or a virtual power plant, would have 200,000 subsystems. Or, 200,000 5 kilowatt batteries would be the equivalent of one power plant that has a capacity of 1,000 megawatts. While one battery could falter, 200,000 of them that operate from remote locations are more durable.  While virtual power plants and microgrids make use of the local distribution system, they avoid the long-distance transmission lines. Downed distribution lines could impact delivery. However, the microgrids export power to specific circuits and it is thus highly unlikely the whole system can go down.  “An onsite generator runs when the power goes out,” says Voltus’ Dixon. “We can connect them to the internet and remotely, turn them on and off. That takes the burden off of the grid and it keeps power flowing to mission-critical facilities. If the city of New Orleans developed a virtual power plant, it would allow those same facilities to upgrade their generators within a microgrid while providing resiliency — not just for themselves but also for other businesses.”  Consider the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar that has a microgrid: it uses landfill gas and solar photovoltaics combined with energy storage. The goal is resiliency — to bounce back as soon as possible from a power loss. The base also needs to keep the lights on for at least 14 days in the event of a major catastrophe such as a wildfire. During last summer’s heatwave in California, the station had extra electricity that it shared with the neighboring community. According to Michael Burr, who is the director of the Microgrid Institute, if investments in renewable energy are paired with battery storage and microgrids, they can improve resiliency. “The higher the cost of experiencing an outage, the easier case it is to make for a microgrid.”  Incredible Value Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) workers install a Viper Recloser in Yountville, California, U.S., ... [+] on Wednesday, April 29, 2020. The California Public Utilities Commission proposed to require large investor-owned utilities to speed up the deployment of microgrids and other so-called resiliency projects to minimize the impacts of wildfire-induced outages and power shut-offs. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg What lessons might Entergy have learned between 2005 when Katrina wreaked havoc and 2021 when Ida lambasted the Gulf Coast? It is always about quickly restoring power and without endangering lives.  The corporate structure collapses to facilitate decision-making. Power is then shifted to a centralized disaster-response team that is given the authority to carry out the utility’s mission. As such, “war rooms” form, and meetings begin with key personnel. Together, the group decides whether resources will be deployed and if so, where and to what extent. During Hurricane Katrina, Entergy had a storm management team that established 40-50 staging areas. Altogether, 1,200 workers from all over the country helped prosecute the storm and calm the fears of customers, who phoned into call service centers around the Southeast — to the tune of 200,000 in one day alone. The hurricane knocked out four times as many customers as any storm before it. In all, 3,000 miles of transmission wires went out while 30,000 miles of distribution lines suffered and 263 substations malfunctioned.  And after each natural disaster, utilities must replay the event to figure out how they can do better the next time. Specifically, they review what regions asked for help and whether they received the assistance in a timely and safe manner. It’s about getting every cog in the wheel to properly function and then sharing that information industrywide so that others can learn. As for Entergy, Ida may have taught it the value of 21st Century energy technologies.  “In 2005, we didn’t even have smartphones,” says Dixon. “Distributed energy resources were in their infancy. Today it is wildly different. Now we have the Internet of Things that forms a cloud that can network together the resources to create incredible value. This year alone, Voltus has dispatched virtual power plants hundreds of times.”  New Orleans will be reeling from Ida for at least several weeks. Distributed energy resources, though, could have mitigated that.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2021/09/05/hurricane-ida-teaches-new-orleans-to-value-high-energy-tech-and-virtual-power-plants/,Hurricane Ida Teaches New Orleans To Value High Energy Tech And Virtual Power Plants
"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is likely to vote for a $3.5 trillion spending package in the end despite his current opposition to its price tag – that’s according to a top White House official and a Senate colleague who place his latest comments within a predictable cycle that ends with him lining up with Democrats. UNITED STATES - JULY 28: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is seen during a Senate vote in the Capitol on ... [+] Wednesday, July 28, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) White House chief of staff Ron Klain said in a CNN interview on Sunday that Manchin is “very persuadable,” and that his concerns about the rising debt and inflation can be addressed through the package’s tax hikes on wealthier Americans. Klain also shrugged off the notion Manchin’s rejection of the $3.5 trillion price tag dooms the bill, telling host Dana Bash that if he had a nickel for every time someone told him the package was dead, “I would be a very, very rich person.” Manchin’s stated opposition to the package, which is expected to include spending on social programs including Medicare expansion, universal pre-K and other longtime liberal priorities, is that it will overheat an already fast-growing economy and doesn’t take into account issues like debt and inflation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on CNN that Manchin has “many times, been willing to get to a place that’s the right place to be,” noting that he voted to pass Democrats’ $1.9 trillion stimulus bill along party lines in March despite his initial opposition. Klobuchar added that she was “not surprised” by Manchin voicing his opposition to the spending package because “this was going to be a tough negotiation,” but reiterated he “gets to the right place.” 51. That’s the number of votes the spending package needs to pass the Senate in a process called budget reconciliation, which allows certain fiscal legislation to be passed without the 10 Republican votes typically needed to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold. Still, in a 50-50 Senate, Democrats will need the votes of Manchin and other moderates like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), who has also balked at the $3.5 trillion price tag. “I, for one, won’t support a $3.5 trillion bill, or anywhere near that level of additional spending, without greater clarity about why Congress chooses to ignore the serious effects inflation and debt have on existing government programs,” Manchin wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Thursday. Klobuchar said she is also pushing Manchin and Sinema to support a carveout to the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold for voting rights legislation, a key demand of civil rights leaders. ""I've talked to Sen. Manchin, Sen. Sinema – there's not that many senators – and that's what we're doing,” she said, adding that Manchin has “signaled interest” in a standing filibuster, which requires senators to physically stand up and speak in order to stall legislation. Senate moderates are in something of a standoff with House progressives, dozens of whom are threatening to try to tank a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal strongly supported by Manchin if it’s not paired with an adequate amount of reconciliation spending.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/05/white-house-says-manchin-very-persuadable-on-35-trillion-budget-bill-as-colleague-says-he-always-gets-to-the-right-place/,White House Says Manchin ‘Very Persuadable’ On $3.5 Trillion Budget Bill As Colleague Says He Always ‘Gets To The Right Place’
"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved. I gave Disney some grief for sitting on the sidelines while Universal and Warner Bros. kept theaters afloat only to throw the Black Widow release into chaos by making the Disney+ release the center of the narrative. However, the Mouse House did come back to us now, at the turn of the tide. Oversized $200 million budget aside, Jungle Cruise has managed excellent holds since its -55% second-weekend. 20th Century’s Free Guy became a well-liked original whose likely $300 million-plus cume would be decent for an original star-driven fantasy even in non-Covid times. And now, Marvel’s “only in theaters” Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) came out swinging. The Simu Liu/Awkafina/Tony Leung action fantasy parlayed obvious anticipation, strong reviews and solid buzz for a superb (even by non-Covid standards) $71.4 million Fri-Sun/$83.5 million Fri-Mon domestic (and $139.7 million worldwide) debut. That’s above the $70 million Fri-Sun debut of F9, with the four-day total above the $80 million Fri-Sun launch of Black Widow. Folks who showed up for an anticipated film over a holiday weekend would have otherwise done so over a conventional Fri-Sun frame. Spider-Man kept the Fri-Sun record($114 million in 2002) for so long partially because so many competitors (Matrix Reloaded, Return of the King, Passion of the Christ, Shrek 2, Revenge of the Sith, X-Men: The Last Stand, etc.) opened on Wednesday or Thursday. This $83 million Fri-Sun estimate (I’m guessing the final figures will be higher) thus stands alongside the $85 million-$95 million Fri-Sun debuts Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange. It also nearly tripled the previous Labor Day record ($30.5 million for Rob Zombie’s Halloween in 2007).  Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (which earned $8 million domestic in IMAX alone) showed that Labor Day weekend, long considered a dead zone for would-be tentpole as summer came to an end and kids went back to school, is as much a fertile launching pad for a big-deal franchise title as any other weekend. The weekend after Labor Day was a dead zone until Warner Bros. launched It to $123 million in 2017. Chris Nolan’s Tenet tried, because being a hero is about trying even if you fail, to jump-start the theatrical industry last Labor Day. While its $53 million overseas debut was solid, its $20 million 11-day Labor Day week debut was not. Destin Daniel Cretton’s well-reviewed ((92% fresh and 7.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes) and well-received (an A from Cinemascore) MCU epic is the first unmitigated Labor Day blockbuster.  Concerns that Shang-Chi would open super-duper low for an MCU movie, concerns that were more about Covid variables (and underwhelming trailers) than anything to do with anticipation for the movie itself, turned out to be laughably pessimistic. Even the Fri-Sun frame is well above the $55-$65 million likes of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Ant-Man and just below Ant-Man and the Wasp ($76 million) and Black Widow ($80 million). As for those trailers, Disney pulled a bait-and-switch not unlike with Aladdin, where they knew that audiences would show up and kept most of the “good” stuff out of the marketing. This will hugely benefit the film in terms of legs, as folks who show up and are surprised by a big movie take an even greater sense of “ownership” over spreading the good word.  While the last two “newbie” MCU movies obscenely overperformed, Shang-Chi is closer to the likes of Ant-Man and Doctor Strange in terms of general audience interest and IP-specific fandom. Up until the $1.346 billion-grossing Black Panther and $1.128 bullion-grossing Captain Marvel, the $677 million-grossing Doctor Strange held the record for a “new” (sans Iron Man) MCU origin story solo flick. Up until early 2017, the only non-Tony Stark MCU movie to breach even $715 million was Guardians of the Galaxy ($773 million in 2014). Up until early 2018, only Guardians 2 ($869 million) and Thor: Ragnarok ($854 million) cracked even $800 million sans Iron Man. Even sky-high performances for Black Panther and Infinity War didn’t prevent Ant-Man and the Wasp ($620 million worldwide) from “only” performing about as well as Ant-Man ($519 million worldwide). Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings A) is only in theaters for the first 45 days and B) has the field to itself in terms of four-quadrant, kid-friendly, big-scale entertainment. With Venom: Let There Be Carnage shifting to October 15 (I told everyone the failures of Snake Eyes and The Suicide Squad were mostly about the general audience interest in those specific films, dammit), there’s nothing akin to Shang-Chi between now and No Time to Die on October 8. Unless Dune pops on October 22, it’ll just be No Time to Die, Shang-Chi and Venom 2 until Eternals in early November. The rest of the field will mostly be adult-skewing flicks (The Card Counter, Cry Macho, The Eyes of Tammy Faye, etc.) and horror movies (Candyman, Malignant, Halloween Kills, etc.).  Ant-Man opened with $58 million in 2015 and legged out to $180 million domestic, while even Guardians of the Galaxy nabbed $333 million in August 2014 from a $94 million debut. Conversely, Thor: The Dark World earned $96 million over its Fri-Mon Veteran's Day debut and ended with “just” $206 million, a fate that would still put Shang-Chi just under $180 million. Legs like Black Panther ($700 million from a $242 million Fri-Mon debut), which may be unlikely but humor me, would give Shang-Chi a boffo $240 million domestic finish. Barring a very unexpected collapse, and I wouldn’t be too shocked by a big second-weekend drop followed by a then-leggy run (see also: Spider-Man: Homecoming), Shang-Chi could be the first movie to pass $200 million domestic since Bad Boys for Life in January 2020. Something-something-diversity. Yes, this is more evidence, for better or worse, that diversity only matters for films audiences already want to see (R.I.P. Snake Eyes and In the Heights). It’s also a sign that MCU’s Phase Four focus on “not a white guy” superheroes will indeed keep the next batch of superhero origin stories and sequels from feeling too passé. Shang-Chi was both a big deal for Asian American moviegoers but also a top-notch martial arts fantasy that plays well to folks who couldn’t care less about the ethnicity of its stars. Most importantly for this discussion, the business-as-usual debut for Shang-Chi (no “successful disappointment” chatter today) is yet more evidence that theatrical exclusivity matters, and that if you give audiences something they want to see (A Quiet Place 2, F9, Black Widow, Candyman, etc.), they’ll still show up.

"WWE fans will likely have to wait another year before the Rock makes his return to the grandest ... [+] stage of them all. (Photo by John W. Ferguson/WireImage) It appears the status for WWE’s biggest part-timers for Wrestlemania 38 have been set in stone. According to the Wrestling Observer, The Rock will not be appearing at Wrestlemania 38 in Dallas. However, he is considered to be a “lock” to wrestle at Wrestlemania 39 at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, according to Ringside News. The original idea called for The Rock to make his long-awaited return to the WWE for next year’s ‘Mania. This would have been when the eight-time WWE Champion’s likely match against his cousin, current Universal Champion Roman Reigns, would have taken place. Now the more likely scenario calls for The Rock’s return in 2023, when his new professional football league — Vince McMahon’s previously-owned XFL — makes its debut. It would make for the perfect time to hype up the new league, which closed its doors upon its return in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the league in the middle of its return season. As far as Brock Lesnar is concerned, the newly-returned superstar has inked a deal with the WWE for eight-to-twelve matches during the next year-and-a-half. Lesnar is slated to appear at Wrestlemania 38 — which is big for the WWE as it plans without The Rock — and is slated to feud with Reigns after returning at Summerslam in August. While fans may not like it, the WWE heavily relies upon its part-timers. The Rock was supposed to be the selling point for next year’s Wrestlemania — he hasn’t appeared in a lengthy match since Wrestlemania 29 — and the plans for his return have been shelved due the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of a live audience over the past year. With the return of Lesnar, the WWE will be able to lean on its recent model of relying on part-timers in marquee matches on the grandest stage of them all. It was only as recently as Wrestlemania 36 that the WWE had Lesnar match up against Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship and Goldberg face Braun Strowman for the Universal Championship. Speaking of part-timers, while Goldberg looks likely to continue his feud with Bobby Lashley for the WWE Title into the fall — when Crown Jewel takes place in October — it’s uncertain if the WWE will ink him to a new deal calling for more matches in 2022. Likewise, while John Cena’s recent return was well-received — culminating in his loss to Reigns at Summerslam — his burgeoning acting career in both movies and TV shows makes his absence from a match at Wrestlemania 38 a very-likely occurrence.  It takes TV time and multiple appearances in order to build up a feud for Wrestlemania. In fact, it took a month of Cena being a member of the WWE’s live touring schedule again to get him prepared for his match against Reigns at Summerslam. Which is a likely reason why Cena hasn’t appeared in a live match at Wrestlemania since 2018. This makes the signing of Lesnar and his upcoming feud with Reigns even more important as the WWE heads into its most important season of the year. There’s a lot to be hashed out as the company’s biggest pay-per-view is seven months away, but it looks set it stone that Lesnar will be in the main event of Wrestlemania — while fans will have to wait one more year for “The Great One.” WWE’s part-time model isn’t dying any time soon.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2021/09/05/the-rock-and-brock-lesnars-status-for-wrestlemania-revealed/,The Rock And Brock Lesnar’s Status For Wrestlemania 38 Revealed
"The Tokyo Paralympic Games came to an end Sunday after nearly two weeks of competition among the world’s top athletes with disabilities, which played out amid Japan’s worsening Covid-19 situation with approximately 300 people connected to the Games testing positive and Japan’s prime minister declining to run for reelection as a result of the surge. Zhou Zhaoqian of Team China crosses the finish line to win the gold medal in the Women's 1500m - T54 ... [+] at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games on August 31. China ultimately earned the most Paralympic medals, taking home 207 medals including 96 golds, while the U.S. came in fourth in the total medal count with 104 medals and 37 golds, behind Great Britain (124 medals) and Russian Paralympic Committee (118 medals). The U.S.’s gold medals included wins in men’s wheelchair basketball and women’s sitting volleyball Sunday just before the Games closed, where the teams defended their titles in the sports with victories against Japan and China, respectively. U.S. athletes also earned world records in multiple swimming and track and field events and took home gold medals in the triathlon, equestrian, archery, cycling and table tennis. Afghanistan’s two-person Paralympic team—including the country’s first-ever female Paralympic athlete—was ultimately able to compete at the Games as the result of a “major global operation,” after organizers initially said they would not be able to leave their country as the Taliban took control. As the Games ended Sunday, organizers said a total of 301 people connected to the Paralympics had tested positive for Covid-19, including 13 athletes—and at least one participant was hospitalized. 4,405. That’s the number of athletes that competed in the Paralympics, according to the Associated Press, a record number of participants in the Games who competed in more than 500 events. That included a record number of female athletes—1,782—and the U.S. Paralympic team had more women than men for the first time. Tokyo is the first city to host the Paralympics twice after the Games first debuted in 1960, ahead of Tokyo’s last Summer Games in 1964. The next city to host them twice will be Los Angeles in 2028. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Friday he will not run for reelection later this month, due to criticism over how his government has handled the country’s worsening Covid-19 situation. Covid-19 cases in Japan and Tokyo are now declining after Japan’s cases skyrocketed in mid-August, but the country is still seeing a record number of Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care in hospitals and the Japanese government reportedly plans to extend its state of emergency in Tokyo through the end of the month. The Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics have drawn widespread criticism and protests for taking place despite the pandemic. “Now that Prime Minister Suga is forced out, taking the blame for his failure to combat the coronavirus, it would be impossible to claim that the Olympics and Paralympics were successful, a unifying moments [sic] for Japan,” Sophia University political scientist Koichi Nakano told the AP. The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games took place this summer after a year-long delay due to the pandemic. The Games played out with stringent Covid-19 protocols in effect, including closing the events to spectators, though the International Olympic Committee did not require athletes to be vaccinated. The Tokyo Games are the most expensive Olympic Games on record, a September 2020 study from the University of Oxford found, with a $16.7 billion price tag. The AP notes lost ticket sales from the pandemic likely contributed to nearly $800 million in additional losses as well.  Marcel Hug of Team Switzerland celebrates after winning gold in the Men’s 5000m - T54 Final at the ...

"Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Sunday expressed unease about the Republican Party winning the congressional majority in the 2022 midterms if it continues on its current trajectory, a rare instance of a sitting congressman breaking with his own party on whether it should win elections. UNITED STATES - AUGUST 24: Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is seen in the Capitol Visitor Center before ... [+] a briefing by administration leaders on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan on Tuesday, August 24, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Kinzinger, asked in a CNN interview if voters should entrust his party with control of Congress, said they should not if it’s “pushing conspiracy and pushing division and pushing lies.” The Illinois congressman added that the GOP needs to “embrace truth,” have a “full reckoning” on the Capitol riot and “turn away from conspiracy” to earn that trust. Kinzinger is increasingly at odds with many members of his party over their denial of the 2020 election results and downplaying of the Capitol riot – a rift exacerbated by his membership on a House Capitol riot select committee likely targeting GOP members. Kinzinger said in the interview it is “really bad politics” for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to threaten companies that comply with the panel’s request to preserve the phone records and data of Capitol riot defendants and others who sought to overturn the election. He also took aim at members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus who have made similar threats and called for him to be booted from the House GOP, accusing them of “talking about things like ‘bloodshed,’” and “flirting around with white nationalism.” Forbes has reached out to McCarthy’s office for comment. 9. That’s the number of members on the Jan. 6 select committee, seven Democrats, Kinzinger and Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who was recently named the panel’s vice chair. McCarthy withdrew his five appointments to the panel in July after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to seat two of them: Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Cheney, like Kinzinger, has frequently broken with fellow House Republicans over their steadfast support for former President Donald Trump and contempt for efforts to investigate the Capitol riot. She said McCarthy lacks the “commitment to the Constitution” necessary to be speaker after he pulled his appointees in July. “Is it obstruction? I don’t know... but I would certainly recommend he never go there again,” Kinzinger said of McCarthy in the interview, who has been accused by an ethics watchdog of obstructing the Capitol riot probe with his threats to telecom companies. “That, to me, is a pretty scary place to go in this world if we start using our power as a way to get the outcome we want,” he added. Freedom Caucus members are pushing McCarthy to allow the House GOP conference to vote on a rule that would boot members who get committee assignments without the blessing of GOP leadership, which would oust Cheney and Kinzinger for taking their appointments to the Jan. 6 panel from Pelosi. McCarthy has not said whether he will allow a vote.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/05/gop-rep-kinzinger-says-his-party-shouldnt-win-house-majority-if-its-pushing-lies/,GOP Rep.

"It’s 2035, all cars are electric, and the massive Hurricane Iris has hit Louisiana. Much of New Orleans is under water, and emergency workers with their Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks need to rescue families and pets. But Louisiana has lost power, and the trucks are all dead. The Blessey family, which has lived in New Orleans for generations, want to get out of town to stay with relatives. They can’t set off in their Chevy Bolt EV because they won’t be able to recharge it on the way.  We are still in 2021—but this is what the future could look like if much of the car fleet becomes electric. On September 5, almost a week after Hurricane Ida, 640,000 customers, or more than one quarter of Louisiana households, are still without power and unable to recharge any electric vehicles they might own. Gasoline and diesel are winners when natural disasters interfere with the electricity grid. Federal and state governments have two contradictory goals. The first is increasing the share of electricity that is made with renewables and phasing out fossil fuels: with current technology, this goal makes electricity more expensive and less reliable. The second is mandating more electricity use by requiring that new vehicles run on electricity rather than gasoline. The combination of these two goals makes transportation less resilient to hurricanes and other natural disasters.  Natural disasters and electricity outages are not uncommon events. The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration keeps track of scores of electricity outages each year. Some are minor events affecting small numbers of customers for a few minutes. Others, such as Hurricane Ida, affect millions of customers for days on end.  Although California wants all new cars to be battery-powered electric by 2035, the state does not have an effective plan to keep pace with existing electricity demand and future rapidly-growing demand from a new all-electric vehicle fleet. As well as “rolling blackouts,” scheduled blackouts when electricity does not have enough power to support peak summer demand, California’s Pacific Gas and Electric

  cuts off power to prevent wildfires. This happened last month to stop the spread of the Dixie Fire.  The banner headline at PG&E’s website states, “Wildfire season is here. Are you prepared for power shutoffs?” PG&E warns, “This is called a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS). Be prepared for outages lasting several days.” But keeping vehicles operating is also a matter of public safety. President Biden’s August Executive Order set a separate Federal goal of having half the vehicles sold in the United States be battery-powered electric by 2030. New electric cars would be an advantage for an electricity generating industry that could meet demand with all available technologies, but it is a nightmare for an industry that is asked to meet electricity demand with renewables that go down during hurricanes and with little carbon-based power.  America’s transportation fleet can and does operate well with consumer choice for power sources rather than artificial government targets. New York State Wilderness Guide Larry Powers uses his EZ Go 72-volt electric golf cart to get around his property—when he is not hauling materials in his Chevy Silverado to add to his campsites.   No government mandate forces Mr. Powers to use an electric vehicle; Larry uses an electric vehicle when it makes sense. Other Americans freely choose electric vehicles too, but forcing everyone to do so would impose substantial costs on the economy. The climate crisis is the stated reason for moving to electric cars because they have lower tailpipe emissions, so they are cleaner on the road. But if the climate crisis is going to bring more weather-related events that contribute to outages, electric vehicle mandates are not the way to go. Whether the result of a hurricane on the East Coast or insufficient electricity power generation capacity on the West Coast, electricity outages harm Americans. They make our lives uncomfortable, and they make us less inclined to become more dependent on electricity.  Hurricane Ida has shown us that today’s government decisions on electricity generation and vehicle requirements are in direct conflict. American consumers are being asked to pay higher prices for electric vehicles—which depend on higher prices for less-dependable electricity that may not be available during peak demand or in the aftermath of wildfires, tornadoes, and hurricanes. This is not a resilient, prosperous future.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianafurchtgott-roth/2021/09/05/electric-vehicles-powerless-during-hurricanes/,Electric Vehicles Powerless During Hurricanes
"A change of pace this week. Instead of an economically-focused piece, the subject this time will be restaurants. In particular, restaurants that have closed but that are very much missed.  Up front, the list is going to be a mix. Some restaurants high end, some in between, and some of the fast food or dive variety. The only commonality to them is that they were all a joy to dine in before closing.  10. Chasen’s (Los Angeles, CA) – Though its address was West Hollywood, Chasen’s gave off a Beverly Hills vibe that included it being on Beverly Boulevard. The high-end restaurant famously had booths on the left and right side of a seemingly narrow room, and the legend was that the side you were seated on signaled your status or lack thereof as a celebrity, businessman, or politician (the Reagans were known to darken the restaurant’s doors). Very excellent French fries and red meat dishes, plus chili that regulars couldn’t get enough of.  9. The Post House (New York, NY) – On 63rd Street between Park and Madison inside the Lowell Hotel, this was the best of all the New York steak places. Misguided sorts will say Peter Luger’s, or Sparks, or Strip House, and while all good none could combine food quality with atmosphere in the way that the Post House did. Blackstone
 
  BX
  co-founder Pete Peterson was a regular, so were all manner of other major business players, plus Billy Joel could occasionally be spotted at the bar.  8. Demon Dogs (Chicago, IL) – Located under the Fullerton “L” in the Lincoln Park area of Chicago, Chicago’s best hot dogs were Demon Dogs. Nearby Wiener’s Circle didn’t hold a candle despite what Oprah supposedly once said. Demon Dogs was owned by former Notre Dame (don’t hold it against him) football player Peter Schivarelli, and being inside the restaurant made patrons feel like they were very much in Chicago. Indeed, Schivarelli had a business relationship with the band that took its name from the city, and its music was always playing at pretty high volume. The hot dogs came with French fries that yours truly thought merely edible, and not nearly as good as those at another Chicago institution, Portillo’s. Supposedly Demon Dogs closed when DePaul University made Schivarelli an offer he couldn’t refuse for the space.  7. Race Pizza (Philadelphia, PA) – The most famous cheesesteak places in Philly are arguably the restaurants located on Passyunk Avenue, Gino’s and Pat’s. Jim’s also comes up, but the view here is that none of the ones mentioned come close to vivifying the genius of a cheesesteak sandwich. Race Pizza, formerly located at Race and 12th Street near the Philadelphia Convention Center, truly honored the sandwich concept. All that, plus the pizza was a must too.  6. Harry’s Bar (Century City, CA) – Located in a shopping mall across Avenue of the Stars from the Century Plaza Hotel, Harry’s met the needs of studio bosses, the agents they negotiated with, along with the capital allocators who managed the money of both. Based on the Harry’s Bar in Florence, the Century City outpost had steak sandwiches on “toast points” that were beyond tasty, matchstick French fries, and a movie industry vibe that arguably beat the atmosphere of the original in Italy.  5. Maid-Rite (Hopkins, MN) – Located in a strip mall of sorts off of a Minneapolis interstate, Maid-Rite was the home of the legendary “loose” burger. These were cheeseburgers that lucky customers ate with a spoon in hand since the ground beef wasn’t shaped into a patty. Call it a “Sloppy Joe” minus onions and other excess, the main thing is that the loose burgers were spectacular.  4. American City Diner (Washington, D.C.) – Owned by Jeffrey Gildenhorn, a D.C. institution in his own right, American City Diner never survived his death in 2017. “ACD” had biscuits and gravy that could measure up to anything found in the south, real mashed potatoes with “yellow” gravy, and remarkable milk shakes served in big silver cups. It was a destination for parents with young kids, late-night diners eager to consume a fourth meal of the day, along with power players at all hours who loved the food along with its Chevy Chase location.  3. Dino’s (Pasadena, CA) – By the 1970s Pasadena’s once-fashionable Colorado Boulevard had gone the way of pawn shops, actual dive bars with truly disreputable people, and X-rated movie theaters. In the ‘80s the Boulevard began to clean up, but the east side of Colorado where Dino’s was located never really went the fancy route. It didn’t matter. Dino’s red sauce meals (minestrone soup as the side, with endlessly good bread) engendered immense loyalty throughout the San Gabriel Valley. Thoughts of its spaghetti with meat sauce cause one’s mouth to water to this day.  2. Au Pied de Cochon (Washington, D.C.) – Legend has it that this Wisconsin Avenue NW restaurant in Georgetown was a quiet meeting place for CIA and KGB spies looking to exchange information of the top secret variety. The latter surely was a lure for diners, but the real appeal was excellent breakfast food, otherworldly French fries, and all of it served with French bread befitting the restaurant’s name. Eventually it moved to a part of Georgetown’s M Street that was away from the action, and that meant it no longer served ravenous late-night diners exiting the various bars that were formerly packed. While Au Pied de Cochon’s final closure predated the decline of Georgetown as a nightlife spot more broadly, it’s easy for nostalgists to argue that its closure foretold the end.  1. Bean’s (Austin, TX) – Chicken fried steak is a menu item that most likely associate with Denny’s or IHOP, but the reality is that neither do this most tasty of meals justice. To be clear, this isn’t a knock on Denny’s or IHOP as much as it’s a love letter to what would be the proverbial “death row” meal for all manner of Americans, Texans in particular. None did it better than Bean’s, which was on the quieter, more office-oriented end of 6th Street in Austin. Chicken fried steak is surely an acquired taste, but Bean’s chicken fried steak was so spectacular that no acquiring was required. This former California resident was hooked right away during college, only for Bean’s to be replaced by another popular, not nearly as good, but still very much missed flash in the pan dining concept by the name of Sfuzzi’s. Nothing could replace Bean’s, as any long-time Austin resident will tell you. The statistic now is that eight Californians move to Austin each day, and as chicken fried steak is in many ways the signature Texas dish, it’s probably wise for one of the tech gazillionaires to revive a little bit of what Austin used to be as a way of culturing all the new left coast arrivals.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2021/09/05/the-top-10-american-restaurants-that-are-no-longer-with-us/,The Top 10 American Restaurants That Are No Longer With Us
"The characters played by Jeon Do-yeon and Ryu Jun-yeol meet on a late night bus. The soundtrack for the Korean drama Lost incorporates Jeff Buckley’s version of the Leonard Cohen song Hallelujah, the anthem Buckley recorded before committing suicide two decades ago. The timing is significant, because two of the drama’s characters are listening to it while mourning the loss of their mutual friend, who committed suicide with his lover. It was their friend’s favorite song.  Kang-jae, played by Ryu Jun-yeol, asks Ddak-ye, played by Yoo Su-bin, what the song is and why they are listening to it. Yet his approach to life could be summed up by some of the lyrics that talk about not trusting love. Handsome Kang-jae is a player who relies on the generosity of older wealthy women. He does a good job of pretending he’s jaded and nothing touches him, but he’s haunted by a sense of loneliness. He acts tough until his friend commits suicide and the pain he can’t express seems to subtly ripple under his skin. It would be too dangerous to let down his guard. He has to survive. While dealing with funeral matters, he meets Bu-jung, played by Jeon Do-yeon, on a bus. Bu-jung is depressed and she has secrets to hide. Lately, she sleepwalks through life and cries on buses. She can’t tell her husband or father what troubles her but trying to deal with it alone has overwhelmed her. The bus is almost empty when Kang-jae sees Bu-jung crying. There’s no reason that Kang-jae, who is 13 years younger than Bu-jung, should stop to talk to her, but he offers her a handkerchief, a present from one of his patrons. Perhaps he sees his own emptiness mirrored in her. They are both lonely. They both feel empty. The drama is directed by Hur Jin-ho. It’s a first drama for the director of several films including Forbidden Dream, The Last Princess, Five Senses of Eros and April Snow. In Lost his direction magnetically draws viewers to feel like fellow travelers on that lonely late night bus and to hope these sad characters might find some solace. As an actor, Ryu Jun-yeol is such a master of physicality that he seems to inhabit a different body in each of his roles, which include the drama Reply 1988 and the films Taxi Driver, Money, The King and Believer. His role in The King won him a Best New Actor Award at the Baeksang Arts Awards. His role as Kang-jae is an intriguing mix of swagger and vulnerability that deserves to win him yet another award.  Jeon Do-yeon, who plays the heartbreakingly numb Bu-jung, recently appeared in the films Emergency Declaration, Beasts Clutching At Straws and Ashfall. She won a Best Actress award at the 60th Cannes Film Festival for her role in Secret Sunshine, as well as Best Actress awards at the Baeksang Arts Awards for her roles in Birthday and The Shameless.

"China e-commerce heavyweight was hit with a $2.8 billion anti-monopoly final by regulators earlier ... [+] this year. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) China’s ongoing anti-monopoly campaign is part of a larger global push by regulators against big tech, and will reinforce a shift among venture investors in the country toward enterprise and deep technology companies, according to a member of the Forbes Midas List ranking of the world’s top venture capitalists. “We're seeing the impact,” James Mi, founding partner of Lightspeed China Partners told the recently held U.S.-China Business Forum. The 3rd annual gathering was held online on Aug. 18.  Mi ranked No. 53 on the 2021 Forbes Midas List unveiled in April, helped by successful investments in Pinduoduo and Meituan. Lightspeed China is the China investment partner of Lightspeed Venture Partners, which manages $10 billion in assets globally.  “In the past, China's anti-monopoly regulation enforcement efforts were very limited,” Mi continued. “You see (with) a lot of the companies in China, the number one and two companies merged together. Usually, you wouldn’t pass that muster in the U.S., but now I think the government is seeing that needs to change.” China China e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba was hit with a $2.8 billion anti-monopoly fine in April; food delivery app Meituan, another consumer-interfacing service, is reportedly facing a $1 billion fine.  “The impact is on the biggest players” in China, Mi believes. “It has a little bit of benefit for a not-number-one or even a number two, maybe the No. 3 players — you have more room to operate.” “This is not just happening in China,” Mi said. “In the U.S. Congress, there are a lot of efforts, and they're looking at the big Internet companies, like Facebook and Google, and whether they should be broken up.  I joined Google way back in 2003. It was a very, very small company. Right now, it has become a really big conglomerate.” The upshot is that early-stage venture investors will “probably put a little bit less weight” in the consumer Internet space, Mi said. “There are still plenty of opportunities” in consumer-related companies “but there are just other much bigger opportunities in enterprise and deep technology that we can capture,” he added.  Mi, 53, has a long record of success in tech and China business. Before joining Lightspeed in 2008, he was the chief representative of Google’s China office, where he led investments in Baidu, Dianping (later bought by Meituan), Xunlei and Ganji (bought by 58). Earlier in his career, he co-founded iTelco Communications, a VOIP global communication products supplier, and held management positions at Intel. The Shanghai native holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering from Princeton and an undergrad degree in physics from Fudan University in Shanghai. Lightspeed China's James Mi So in what areas is Mi looking to invest today?  “One thing that’s pretty obvious is enterprise services. The pandemic accelerates a lot of the enterprises adapting these cloud services,” he noted.  The impact of tension between the U.S. and China has also changed investment dynamics in China, Mi said. In the past, Chinese companies wanted to purchase semiconductors and deep technology products from Silicon Valley, he said. “Now people worry that, given U.S. restrictions, they may not be able to (buy them), and so there's a huge demand for domestic solutions. Mostly, it will be provided by startups.” The latest evidence of China’s big push into semiconductors came on Friday with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, the largest local maker, announcing a $8.87 billion investment in a new plant in Shanghai. “I'm not just talking about semiconductor chips or equipment, but many others. For example, in the autonomous driving space — this is a global big trend,” Mi said. “And other than the AI software layer, one of the most key, important parts is LIDAR (laser-based radar detection products).  So we invested very early on.” Lightspeed China holds a stake in Hesai, a world leader in the business, along with Bosch, GL Ventures, Xiaomi, Meituan and Baidu. Demand for autonomous driving, ironically, may be a beneficiary of the anti-monology push at delivery firm Meituan. Big delivery companies looking to lower costs will turn more than ever to automation, he noted.  China will be competitive for new high-tech products because of its manufacturing strength, Mi said. “Supply chain and manufacturing capabilities are very strong. I'm not just talking about low-cost manufacturing, I'm talking about cutting-edge technology products. You need a lot of iteration. You even need to make your own equipment for your manufacturing production line. That's the edge the Chinese startup company would have,” he said.  Mi is also upbeat about green technology, whose importance has been underscored by extreme weather around the world this year. “It is not trivial to get to carbon peak in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2050 by U.S. and European standards, and by 2060 for China.” The world “lacks technology,” he said.   One “very interesting” area to be investing in in the coming decade, Mi believes, is solar. Another is battery technology. “Certainly, China has CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology), and CATL has been the leader in that space,” but it is also an example of a business that is benefiting from changing technology.  “There are multiple technologies, and I think even CATL won’t be able to keep up. This is a typical startup story, right? You come up with something very disruptive— not only the battery but also the materials used in the battery.” Looking ahead, he expects big demand for batteries and storage to be a driver of change. “This will be constantly a huge demand, not only for electric vehicles, but also for energy storage, which is required for the solar and wind (businesses) because they are not stable. You need a battery-based storage solution.”   Mi optimistically sees green technology as an area in which the U.S. and China can collaborate. “Both countries can really work together” since both hold technology advantages that can be pooled.   Mi also shared with forum attendees some tips for venture investment success. “We always think we need to be really nimble,” Mi said.  “We always focus on the early-stage technology investment. We adapt ourselves for the new opportunities. We used to focus on the consumer Internet, but we started investing in enterprise services over 10 years ago. Then we started to invest in deep tech over eight years ago and green tech over three years ago.  It’s something that we remind ourselves: always keep a growth mindset, always reset ourselves,” he said. “Don't sit on your past success, be humble, and always try to learn new things.” See related posts:  Seven Months In, Biden Uncertainty On China Policy Is Hurting American Business U.S.-China Collaboration Could Open Door For New Ping-Pong Diplomacy: Kevin Rudd @rflannerychina",https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/09/05/china-anti-monopoly-push-adds-to-enterprise-and-deep-technologys-appeal-lightspeeds-james-mi/,China Anti-Monopoly Push Adds To Enterprise And Deep Technology’s Appeal: Lightspeed’s James Mi

Spending at U.S. retailers fell 1.1% last month compared with June according to a Commerce Department report issued today.

Department stores are no exception, with several reporting positive Q2’s in recent weeks. However, department stores were in a special bad place coming into the pandemic, with mall traffic already on the decline and on-going struggles to adapt to an omnichannel and more direct-to-consumer world. Outsize results in what is hopefully a late stage of the pandemic are not going to be enough to make a dent in these challenges.  To be fair, department stores know they need to change, and there is more innovation today in this retail vertical than there has been in decades. They’re trying. But there are still three major issues that these retailers have not addressed - and that the pandemic has made bigger and sharper. If department stores don’t directly address them, their chances of success in a post-pandemic world are zero. What’s With Those Q2 Results? According to Seeking Alpha, Macy’s

Dillard’s results were especially notable, with sales up 72% year-over-year, but also up 12% over 2019’s second quarter. And it wasn’t just sales - the retailer posted a profit in Q2 for the first time since 2016. That good news is a bright spot in an otherwise dismal outlook for department stores worldwide. In the UK, 83% of department store space has closed down in the last five years, leaving just 79 department stores, down from 467 five years ago. In South Korea, a department store haven, retailers are making major investments in their facilities to win back shoppers who moved online. And back in the US, researchers say that consumers’ pent up demand for shopping will result in department stores’ revenues declining “just 3.7%” in 2021 vs. the 16.7% decline in 2020. Worse, that projected decline still has the potential to widen before the end of the year, with the delta variant putting a check on both consumer confidence and store traffic - and malls remain a particularly shunned retail destination. Q2 results might give department stores a needed shot in the arm for both revenue and profitability, but what these retailers really need is a strong Q4 - the critical holiday season. Unfortunately, continued supply chain disruptions, fears about inflation, labor shortages, severe weather events, and the threat of something worse than delta are all combining to ensure that Q4 is going to be anything but strong. Retailers may not have to discount so much when inventory is scarce, but they’re not going to bring in a lot of revenue if they have nothing to sell. Running Out of Time It’s not just the department stores themselves that face challenges - where they live is crumbling too. Malls, the main home of department stores, have been a tale of two extremes for going on decades now. Malls that are doing well are doing really well, and malls that are not doing well are basically zombies trudging along until they fall over. Department stores are not malls’ saviors, either, as a death spiral of declining traffic that leads to declining sales that reinforces the declining traffic makes department stores more the canary in the coal mine for a mall’s decline than the basis for getting a mall back on track. As goes the mall, so goes the department store - and vice versa. There doesn’t seem to be a lot that can reverse the course, either. The longer it feels questionable whether going to the mall is a safe idea, the more consumers develop ingrained habits that lead to avoiding the mall - and department stores - going forward. And those habits were already in play long before the pandemic hit. Consumers are looking to digital first before ever setting foot in a store, and when they look at the items department stores carry, they’re more likely to find the brands before they find the store they want to buy it in. Those brands have become really good at appealing directly to consumers, too. They haven’t had much choice! Between the bankruptcies in the department store space, as well as consolidation in the industry, the weakness of malls - brands can’t afford to lose the distribution of their retailer partners, but they can’t afford to wait around until department stores figure out how to get back on their feet, either. This tension between channel partners only gets worse as retailers compete for shoppers and a compelling value proposition, while brands seek to protect their price points and brand promises, a tension that McKinsey calls “wholesale Darwinism”.  Then pile on upstart department store “disruptors” like Neighborhood Goods or Showfields. These companies consider themselves more venue than retail location, and bill themselves as platforms for brands to tell their stories to customers. It’s a lot easier to shake up the model when you can start from scratch. And you know there is potential for major disruption when even Amazon

  is looking at getting into the game. With malls failing on one side, and brands getting better at going direct to consumer - and reaping major benefits from the strategy - on the other, along with disruptors waiting in the wings to pounce, the window of opportunity for department stores to turn things around gets smaller every day. They Are Trying... None of these challenges are news. But the strategies department stores are putting in place to respond to these challenges seem to get more feeble and incremental as we go. Some companies have been true innovators - Nordstrom certainly sits in that category. Between clienteling investments, experiments with smaller local stores built on a natively omnichannel model, and even livestreaming, the company has been trying new things, reaching consumers in new ways, and seems to recognize the need for more than just cosmetic changes. At the other end of the spectrum is Dillard’s, which seems set to take its windfall Q2 results and… buy back stock. In between are Macy’s and Kohl’s, which are focused on controlling inventory and getting faster. Both are good things, but still do not address the fundamental challenges that department stores face. Macy’s was experimenting with a collaboration with Facebook before the pandemic - combining Facebook’s data expertise with Macy’s in-store reach to promote hot new brands before they hit big. And they’re continuing the collaboration strategy with companies like Toys R Us for this holiday season. Will it be enough? No. Department stores are fiddling with the deck chairs on the Titanic. Tighter controls on inventory do nothing to improve a company’s appeal when the internet has an infinite assortment. And livestreaming might be cool, but only if the person doing it is a trusted source for style tips or product recommendations.  So what should they be focused on? Three big things: 1. What does the retailer stand for? Retailers that sell other companies’ brands cannot differentiate to consumers on “I have all the best brands”. Any brand a consumer wants is literally a click away in a web browser. What does a consumer need a retailer for when they can go directly to the source for brand information - and products? This is a particular challenge for retailers that have a long history, like Macy’s. It’s easy to think that the weight of that history and the trust they once earned as a fashion-savvy advisor to consumers will last forever. It won’t. If you’re not a strong digital player with a distinct personality and brand promise that can be conveyed easily in social media channels, then the next generation of shoppers is never going to know who you are.  And Gen Z shoppers in particular demand that companies stand for something. It doesn’t have to be something that makes the world a better place (actually, it will and quickly, but one challenge at a time). It just has to resonate with the shoppers you’re trying to attract. Private label - a common investment strategy of department stores today - can give retailers something more unique to say, but even private label has limits in terms of how much consumers trust you as an expert. It still has to tie back to something that the retailer stands for - some basis of expertise that gives the retailer credibility as an advisor that customers should listen to. Why should I trust Macy’s? Without a solid answer to that question, department stores don’t stand a chance. 2. How can retailers help brands, and vice versa? There has been too much antagonism in wholesale channels - a problem that has lived on for decades. Brands don’t want to see their products mixed in with competitors, and they absolutely hate it when retailers run promotions and discounts. Retailers have used and abused brands to control costs, instituting near-punitive contracts with no-penalty returns or high penalties for late or missed shipments.  In the meantime, the power dynamic has shifted. Brands now have the upper hand, and not because they wanted it but because the consolidation in the department store distribution channel has forced them to get it. They know more about what consumers want from them and find themselves fighting department stores to share that expertise - to get products they know will do well in a location into distribution. The disruptor department stores get it - they position themselves as brand partners, co-strategists and collaborators. They’re not trying to sell the best brands, they’re trying to offer up cool brands that consumers might not find on their own. They’re positioned on customer expertise - “I know what you like, and I go find brands that you’re going to find interesting” - and they offer that expertise to help brands be successful. Department stores need brands, and brands need department stores. But there are so many more tools out there to use for collaboration, and so many more opportunities to do unique things that combine customer expertise, location expertise, and product and lifestyle expertise. Both department stores and brands need to give a little in how they deal with each other, in order to get a lot. 3. Why should consumers go to (my) stores? Department stores need to get really honest with themselves about this question. Yes, consumers do enjoy shopping and they do consider in-store shopping a “fun” and meaningful activity that they want to continue to enjoy. But that doesn’t mean they’ll go to your store.  Having inventory in stock only makes a difference when the item is an immediate must-have, and 99% of what department stores sell is not. On hand inventory does not drive consumers to department stores. Services can certainly help, including omnichannel services like buy online pickup in stores (BOPIS) or online return to stores. Even better are services that require a physical presence, like a beauty salon or spa, or repair work. Unfortunately, most department stores have cut a lot of these services. And they’ve also cut the staffing that would put trusted advisors onto the store floor to help solve customer problems. Events are another way to drive traffic - trunk shows or celebrity visits, etc. Both malls and department stores used to do a lot more in this area, but again have cut these kinds of events to the bone or stopped them altogether - long before the pandemic made them challenging anyway. Events require effort, sustained local effort, and retailers have not been willing to fund that effort. Unfortunately, assortment and availability just aren’t enough to naturally drive traffic to stores. Retailers must have something more compelling. Department stores, especially the palaces to consumerism in flagship locations, simply cannot rely on their history or their brand to bring customers in. They must have more compelling reasons built more on the brand value proposition than on inventory. The Bottom Line It’s still tough out there for all kinds of non-essential retail. But outside of restaurants and hospitality, few retail verticals face as much challenge as department stores. Product collaborations, partnerships with TikTok influencers, glitzy digital campaigns are not going to be enough to turn things around. Department stores must understand who they really are and what they truly can offer customers. And they need to turn those offers into compelling experiences and services that are best delivered in stores - and with the support and partnership of the brands they offer. If they can’t figure out these basic things, the dire predictions for the future of department stores won’t seem outlandish. They’ll seem inevitable.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/nikkibaird/2021/09/05/three-things-department-stores-must-solve-now-to-build-sustainable-growth/,Three Things Department Stores Must Solve Now To Build Sustainable Growth
"Shelby Rogers, of the United States, reacts after defeating Ashleigh Barty, of Australia, during the ... [+] third round of the US Open tennis championships, Saturday, Sept. 4, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) After securing the biggest victory of her tennis career, Shelby Rogers dropped her tennis racquet on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court, covered her mouth with her hands in disbelief and then retrieved her racquet from the ground before raising her arms in celebration as the crowd roared in approval. The 28-year-old from Mount Pleasant, S.C., the last remaining American woman in the draw, had just knocked off world No. 1 Ash Barty, the top seed and favorite to win the U.S. Open, after losing to her five straight times, including four this year alone. Barty, who came in to New York having won both Wimbledon and Cincinnati, led 5-2 in the final set and twice served for the match, but Rogers fought back, mixed up her tactics with lobs and more patient play and prevailed 6-2, 1-6, 7-6(5). She moved on to face 18-year-old British star Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, where she is guaranteed to take home at least $265,000. “The crowd is next-level this year,” Rogers told the fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium. “You’ve picked who you want to win, so thank you for picking me tonight.” A year ago, when she lost to Naomi Osaka in the quarterfinals when she was working her way back from knee surgery, there were no fans on hand to cheer on the American because of the pandemic. The victory by Rogers came on a big day for the Americans, as three American men are now into the round of 16: No. 22 seed Reilly Opelka, former Baylor commit Jenson Brooksby and Frances Tiafoe. Brooksby became the youngest American man to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open since Andy Roddick in 2002 after surviving a five-setter with Russian Aslan Karatsev Saturday. A fourth American, Jack Sock, retired down two-sets-to-one and 2-1 in the fourth against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev because of a right groin injury on Saturday night. Opelka, Brooksby and Tiafoe are the first trio of American men in a Grand Slam fourth round since the 2011 U.S. Open when John Isner, Mardy Fish, Andy Roddick and Donald Young did it. Tiafoe, who stunned No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev in five sets Friday, faces Canadian No. 12 seed Felix Auger-Aliassime on Sunday.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Opelka, the huge-serving 7-footer who remains American’s most “dangerous” threat at this tournament, meets South Africa’s Lloyd Harris on Monday, while Brooksby gets world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on Monday. Djokovic, who prevailed over 2014 U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori in four sets, is four wins from becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the Grand Slam. Several other young Americans, including Brandon Nakashima and Sebastian Korda, are out of the tournament but show promise for the future. “I think Brooksby is going to be a big second-week guy,” Opelka said after beating Nikoloz Basilishivili, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. “Nakashima. I think Korda. I think the young guys are better than us, if I'm being honest. I think Korda is a hell of a player. Brooksby is brutal. “I'm curious to see his match with Djokovic. I think he can give Djokovic a lot of fits because he's just tricky. Nakashima is as pure of a ball-striker as there is. I think the young guys are going to be the guys to beat from the American standpoint.” As for Rogers, few would have pegged her as the last American woman standing at the U.S. Open. She had knee surgery in 2018 and told her physical trainer six months later, “I’m not sure if I’ll ever play again.” She added in an ESPN interview with Chris McKendry: “The people around me were just incredible encouraging me. The people around you can help so much when you’re doubting yourself and you don’t believe in yourself.” Ashleigh Barty, of Australia, returns a shot to Shelby Rogers, of the United States, during the ... [+] third round of the US Open tennis championships, Saturday, Sept. 4, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Entering the tournament, Sofia Kenin, Serena Williams and Venus Williams were all out due to injuries or Covid issues, but stars like Coco Gauff, Sloane Stephens, Danielle Collins and Jessica Pegula were pegged to potentially make deep runs. But entering Saturday night, they were all out of the draw and Rogers had to face someone she had never beaten. She was fantastic in the third, hitting backhand winners and using a 103 mph serve to fight her way back against the reigning Wimbledon champion. Barty had not dropped a set in the tournament but was sloppy from the start. She made 17 unforced errors in the first set and then three more when she held a 5-2 lead in the third that let Rogers back in. The Ashe crowd roared for Rogers on every winner, and she waved her arms and exhorted the fans to get louder. The 28-year-old Rogers broke Barty twice in the third when Barty served for the match. Rogers was overcome by emotions after finally toppling Barty following four losses this year. “Not only moving on here in New York, which is always emotional, you know your home Slam, but just what Ash has done to me in the past,” Rogers said on ESPN. “She took me down twice in Australia in front of her home crowd, she took me down in front of my home crowd [in Charleston] and then she really embarrassed me in Madrid so I guess I just really wanted to show her what New York could do.” Rogers remains the last American woman in the draw, and is also rooting for the remaining American men.  “The guys are doing well, too,” she said on ESPN. “They’ve been super inspiring. Frances, Jack [Sock], Reilly just won, Brooksby [won] so good for him. “The vibes here and everybody getting behind the Americans and supporting them is great. We had a few of the American women out of the draw this year so that was unfortunate but I’ll try to represent as best I can.” The AP contributed reporting.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/05/shelby-rogers-the-last-american-woman-at-the-us-open-stuns-world-no-1-ash-barty-three-american-men-reach-4th-round/,"Shelby Rogers, Last American Woman At U.S. Open, Stuns No. 1 Ash Barty; Three U.S. Men Reach 4th Round"
"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will try leading his team to a championship for the ... [+] first time in 11 years. The Green Bay Packers settled on their 53-man roster last week. On paper, it appears to be a championship-level roster. Whether the Packers can become a championship team for the first time since 2010, though, remains to be seen. Here, I rank the roster from No. 1 to 53 in order of importance. A player’s overall ability is the greatest factor in the ranking, but things such as depth at the position weigh heavily, as well.  For example, if the Packers don’t have a quality backup at a position, the starter’s value increases. If Green Bay is extremely deep in an area, the starter’s worth isn’t as great. 1. Aaron Rodgers, QB — Won third MVP in 2020, then said he wouldn’t play for the Packers again during a tumultuous offseason. Rodgers eventually returned, but this is expected to be his last season in Green Bay. Can he lead the Packers to their first Super Bowl appearance in 11 years? 2. Davante Adams, WR — Leads NFL in receiving touchdowns with 58 since 2016. That’s 11 more than any player in football. Entering the final year of his four-year, $58 million contract and his future with team is uncertain. 3. Elgton Jenkins, OL — Became the first Green Bay lineman to start a game at guard, center and tackle in the same season since 1970 AFL-NFL merger. Now, he’ll play left tackle until David Bakhtiari (ACL) returns. 4. Jaire Alexander, CB — Highest-graded cornerback in football last season by Pro Football Focus. Had six games allowing 10, or fewer, yards. 5. Za’Darius Smith, OLB — Posted the most sacks ever (26.0) by a player in his first two seasons with the Packers. Battling a back injury, though, and is questionable for season-opener.  6. Aaron Jones, RB — Ranks second in the NFL over the last two seasons with 30 total touchdowns. His career average is a whopping 5.17 yards per carry. 7. Kenny Clark, NT — One of the NFL’s dominant nose tackles was rewarded with four-year, $70 million deal last season. Coming off an injury-plagued season, though, in which he missed 3 ½ games and his numbers dipped. 8. Darnell Savage, S — Had four interceptions in the final six games of 2020 and flashed the ability to become a perennial Pro Bowler. 9. Josh Myers, C — Second round draft pick will be the starting center from Day 1. Has huge shoes to fill stepping in for Pro Bowler Corey Linsley. 10. Adrian Amos, S — According to Pro Football Focus, had the top coverage grade by a safety last season. Was also PFF’s second-highest rated safety overall. 11. Billy Turner, RT — Versatile player who can line up anywhere but center, but is best suited for right tackle. 12. Rashan Gary, OLB — Took a major jump in Year 2, finishing second on the team in sacks (5.0). Seems poised for a breakout season. 13. Robert Tonyan, TE — Broke franchise record for touchdowns by a tight end (11) last season and ranked second on the team with 52 receptions. 14. Mason Crosby, K — Franchise’s all-time leading scorer has made 42 of 44 field goals the last two years (95.5%) and was 20 for 20 in 2020. 15. Preston Smith, OLB — Sacks plummeted from 12.0 in 2019 to 4.0 last year, then took a pay cut to return. Dropped weight this offseason and seems motivated to return to past form. 16. Krys Barnes, ILB — Undrafted player in 2020 was a major surprise and finished second on the team in tackles as a rookie. He’ll wear the defensive headset and run the show. 17. Kevin King, CB — Mediocre cornerback was torched for a pair of touchdowns by Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in NFC Championship Game. Returned on a one-year contract and is now trying to salvage his career. 18. Marquez Valdes-Scantling, WR — Led the NFL in yards per catch last season (20.9), but must end pattern of costly drops. Entering a contract year. 19. Lucas Patrick, OG — Tough, physical player who held up well in first year as a starting guard.  20. De’Vondre Campbell, ILB — Had 99 tackles, two sacks, seven tackles for loss, three pass breakups and a forced fumble with Arizona last year. Should be an upgrade from the departed Christian Kirksey. 21. Dean Lowry, DE — One of the team’s highest-paid players has just 3.0 sacks in last two seasons. 22. Royce Newman, OG — Fourth round draft pick appears to have won a starting guard spot in training camp. He’ll be tested early against some terrific defensive lines. 23. Allen Lazard, WR — Big, strong, tough player who will always be limited by a lack of speed. Best blocker among wide receiver group. 24. Eric Stokes, CB — First round draft choice has rare athleticism, speed (4.29) and could overtake Kevin King at some point soon. 25. AJ Dillon, RB — Had just 46 carries as a rookie, but will have expanded role after departure of Jamaal Williams. 26. Chandon Sullivan, CB — Played 729 snaps as No. 3 corner last season. Was mediocre, at best, though, and will have to keep battling for his job.  27. Kingsley Keke, DE — Up-and-comer, finished tied for third on the team with 4.0 sacks last year. 28. Jordan Love, QB — First round draft pick in 2020 is the likely starter in 2022. Showed tremendous growth this preseason, but Packers hope they won’t need him until next fall. 29. Amari Rodgers, WR — Quick, powerful slot receiver who should give offense a weapon it’s been lacking. He’ll also begin the year as Green Bay’s No. 1 punt returner. 30. Randall Cobb, WR — Aging, injury prone player was brought back to Green Bay after quarterback Aaron Rodgers demanded his return.  31. Josiah Deguara, TE — Flashed early in 2020, but played in just two games due to a knee injury. Could be an interesting chess piece for creative offensive coaches to use. 32. Dennis Kelly, OT — Offers depth for a line that’s in flux until LT David Bakhtiari returns. Kelly started all 17 games and logged 1,099 snaps at right tackle last season for Tennessee. 33. TJ Slaton, NT — Fifth round draft pick this season was initially viewed as a developmental player. After an impressive summer, though, he could be a surprise contributor. 34. Jon Runyan, OG — Played 160 solid snaps as a rookie. Opens the year as the No. 3 guard. 35. Henry Black, S — Steadily improved during his rookie season and could take substantial jump in 2021. 36. Malik Taylor, WR — Above average special teams player who flashed potential this summer to become a bigger part of the passing game. 37. Kylin Hill, RB — Led Southeastern Conference in rushing yards per game in 2019, before a rough 2020 campaign. He’ll begin the year as Green Bay’s No. 1 kick returner. 38. Marcedes Lewis, TE — Offers little in the passing game, but remains one of the best blockers on the team. 39. Corey Bojorquez, P — Came in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams last week. Career average (45.0) and net (41.8) are both higher than departed JK Scott. 40. Ty Summers, ILB — Led the Packers and tied for sixth in the NFL with 12.0 special teams tackles last season. 41. Yosh Nijman, OT — Enormous man (6-7, 315) whose primary role has been on special teams. Could open the year as the No. 3 tackle based on health of others. 42. Oren Burks, ILB — Former third round pick has failed time and again to win a job at inside linebacker, but is a key special teams performer. 43. Tyler Lancaster, DE — Terrific effort player will always be limited by mediocre athleticism. 44. Vernon Scott, S — Seventh round draft pick in 2020 played in 15 games as a rookie and made his mark on special teams. 45. Hunter Bradley, LS — Has been more down than up his first three seasons in this role. If Bradley’s struggles continue, he’s a top candidate to be released. 46. Jonathan Garvin, OLB — Played in first eight games last year, then was a healthy scratch the last 10 games. Could see action early if Za’Darius Smith is out. 47. Isaac Yiadom, CB — Was acquired in a trade for Josh Jackson late in training camp. Should be a factor on special teams immediately.  48. Dominique Dafney, TE — Intriguing prospect who was elevated to the active roster late in 2020 and caught one touchdown. 49. Jack Heflin, DE — Undrafted free agent made play after play all summer and earned spot on the roster. 50. Isaiah McDuffie, ILB — Undersized, sixth round draft pick was fifth in the country in tackles (107) while at Boston College last year. 51. Jake Hanson, C — Spent most of 2020 on the injured reserve list with a hip injury. Struggled in the preseason and has a lot to prove. 52. Chauncey Rivers, OLB — Waived by Baltimore Aug. 4, signed by Green Bay the following day and shocked many by making the final 53. 53. Shemar Jean-Charles, CB — Developmental player who broke up 27 passes during his last two seasons at Appalachian State.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/05/ranking-the-green-bay-packers-roster-from-no-1-53/,Ranking The Green Bay Packers’ Roster From No. 1 To 53
"Shang-Chi Almost two weeks ago, I documented the impressive critical premiere of Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which had debuted with a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even among many other highly reviewed Marvel movies over the years, that made it tied to land within the top 5. But, there was a caveat. If you’ve been tracking Rotten Tomatoes scores as long as I have, you’ll note that generally speaking, they start out higher than they end up, and the more reviews come in, the more they drop. Sometimes this disparity is small, sometimes it’s large, but it’s usually inevitable, especially with comic book movies which are more likely to be reviewed by “enthusiast” press first. Shang-Chi, however, has done something rather miraculous.  Shang Chi Two weeks and 150 new reviews later, its score remains at a 92%. It has not dropped a single point. While there’s still more time to go (probably another 100-150 reviews will come in), this is deeply impressive, and it has kept its status as being tied as a top 5 Marvel movie. And that’s on top of having a wild 98% audience score, something no other film in the MCU has reached (Iron Man is closest with a 95%). Here’s the list of everything in the 90% critic score range: 1. Black Panther – 96% 2. (Tie) Avengers: Endgame, Iron Man – 94% 4. Thor: Ragnarok – 93% 5. (Tie) Shang-Chi, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man Homecoming – 92% 8. The Avengers – 91% 9. (Tie) Spider-Man: Far from Home, Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier – 90% So yes, Shang-Chi is in the absolute upper echelon right now, and the fact that it has not lost any points with so many new reviews in is incredibly rare, if you follow this sort of thing. What I consider “standard,” even for a well-reviewed movie, is maybe a 5-7% drop. The Suicide Squad over at DC debuted with an eye-popping 98%, but that has since dropped to a still-great 91% as more reviews have come in. Sometimes, the disparity is vast. Wonder Woman 1984 debuted at a solid 89% with 70 or so reviews in, but over time, dropped a full thirty points to a rotten 59%, as an example of how extreme this can be. To lose…no points? Especially in the superhero space? A rarity, and Shang-Chi really is that good, it seems. Shang-Chi appears to be performing very well at the box office as well. Some may credit this in part to Disney deciding not to put the film on Disney Plus, unlike Black Widow, which led to a lawsuit from Scarlett Johansson. But the COVID Delta surge is still happening all over the US, which both A) makes these box office figures even more impressive and B) makes me want to say that if you do see the film, try to go to earlier, less crowded showings, and wear a mask, even if not mandated. Just to be safe! It’s great to see Shang-Chi as both a critical and audience hit, and it’s clear he’s going to be a staple in this new phase of the MCU for a long while to come after this.

"Focus on the fun and funny things in life.  Last year, at the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, may have been one of the most stressful times in business. The entire world as we knew it came to what seemed like a screeching halt. People were concerned for their jobs, their families and their future, not to mention their health.  Many companies were forced to adapt to new ways of doing business, which they hoped would be temporary. Here we are, a year and a half later, and while we seem to be back to some sense of normalcy, it’s still quite different. People are still stressed, and as a result, productivity can suffer. One of the ways we managed the stress in our office, or should I say out of the office as we all worked remotely during the Covid-19 quarantine, was through humor. We assigned a new job title, director of HR, to one of our team members. HR did not mean Human Resources. For this job, it meant Humor Resources. Each day we had a Zoom meeting, and the director of HR’s job was to find a short YouTube video that would make us all laugh. Yes, it was fun. It relieved tension and stress. And yes, we all looked forward to it. The reason I bring all of this up is that I recently connected with Paul Osincup from Delivering Happiness. He provides Delivering Happiness workshops and hosts its podcast. As a positivity strategist, his mission is to create workplace happiness. He does this with his humorous and inspirational style of teaching and speaking.  According to Osincup, “Humor is the new mindfulness.” You can actually train your brain to see and experience humor more often. Humor creates a chemical reaction in the brain that can elevate one’s mood. The research proves that happier employees are more productive. When you find something funny, your brain is, as Osincup says, “Flooded with a dose of happiness.” And dose is an acronym, as in D.O.S.E. ·        D is for Dopamine.  ·        O is for Oxytocin.  ·        S is for Serotonin.  ·        E is for Endorphins.  And you don’t have to be naturally funny to become good at using humor. Osincup says, “Humor is not a talent. Humor is a habit.” And he suggests the first step is to self-train your brain toward a funny focus. You become intentional and aware of finding humor. And the more you do it, the better you’ll get. Here are his five suggestions (followed by my comments) for putting Humor Habits in your life:  1.      Curate a personal comedy collection. Thanks to social media, all you have to do is go to YouTube and you’ll find plenty of humor. Once you find a video that makes you laugh, click the like button. If it’s someone who posts a lot of humor, subscribe to the channel.  2.      Share your humor with a friend. Find a friend or colleague with whom you can share your newfound humor on social media. Block a few minutes on your calendar to do so. Research shows that even just the anticipation of humor can help to decrease stress.  3.      Prime the pump for positivity. Don’t just read the business sections of the newspaper and watch the news. Expand to publications and shows—and even YouTube videos—that include humor and content that will make you smile and laugh. In other words, be purposeful about finding humor. 4.      Write it down. This is an exercise that may cause a little “brain pain” at first. Osincup suggests writing down at least three funny things every day. I call this becoming “humor aware.” The research has found that people who write down at least three funny and/or amusing things that they noticed each day for just one week can increase happiness and decrease depression symptoms for up to six months.  5.      Take a funny break. Schedule a specific time to take a break and watch a funny video. You can find the humorous video yourself, or this is a perfect way to utilize an appointed director of HR (Humor Resources) that I mentioned earlier in this article. And why do this alone? Include some others on your team. Everyone deserves the rewards and benefits of humor. Focus on the fun and funny things in life. It’s easy to find things to worry about, but if you train yourself to look for things that make you laugh, you’ll find them too. And be sure to share them when you do!",https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2021/09/05/a-little-laughter-decreases-stress-and-improves-productivity/,A Little Laughter Decreases Stress And Improves Productivity
"Audi Grandsphere concept car, autonomous, electric ""like a first class flight"".  International car shows were thought to be a thing of the past, on their way to oblivion before Covid-19 struck because of exorbitant costs and public disinterest, and finally put out of their misery by the industry’s coronavirus global shutdown. Yet this week in Munich, Germany, there’s an event scheduled called the IAA 
  
  IAA 
  (Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung) Mobility motor show. The exhibition takes over the time slot in the calendar from the biennial but now deceased Frankfurt car show, and before you become too excited, get this description from IHS Markit 
  
  INFO 
 . “Reflecting the immense changes the automotive industry is currently undergoing, the show’s organizers have looked to create a new concept that is more dynamic, with an emphasis on practical demonstrations of technology rather than just the traditional static displays of vehicles,” IHS Markit said in a report. In other words, if you’re looking to find what’s new and exciting in the world of cars and SUVs, you’re likely to be disappointed. As a veteran of the Geneva, Frankfurt, Paris, Detroit international car show shuttle, I found concepts were displayed by manufacturers which often had nothing new to offer except grandiose promises with little chance of ever seeing the light of a driveway. And in this “mobility” show, expect the usual corporate hype and bluster but with some familiar meaningless buzz words thrown in like ecosystem, bandwidth, holistic approach and disruptor. According to Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Duisberg, Germany, the Munich event has failed to attract many foreign car makers, and the few showing up have a new product to sell. The core exhibitors are German and even these are showing mainly concepts.  “The fact that many car manufacturers are absent from IAA 2021 is a response to the presumed effectiveness of the event. Overall, the IAA seems to be planned as a kind of folk festival with discussion platforms and an attached trade fair. Bicycles, start-ups kid’s worlds, fitness arenas, vintage cars – a colorful mix instead of a clear focus,” Dudenhoeffer said.  Dudenhoeffer said it is ironic that a show with the fashionable idea of “mobility” at its core, usually meaning ways to denigrate the car and laud public transport, is taking place at the same time as what he called the “renaissance” of the automobile.   “Individual means of transport such as e-scooters, bicycle or cars are becoming increasingly important. Mobility is again concentrating more on “individual mobility” that gives the car a new dimension,” Dudenhoeffer said.       The Bloomberg news agency, in an article headlined “Auto shows are back and CEOs have deals to do” reminds us of the last big transaction when Groupe PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), but these shows are the time when deals are actually announced after long-draw-out behind the scenes negotiations.  As for the new models on view, given that the mighty Toyota, all the brands relating to the PSA/FCA merger now known as Stellantis, and Nissan won’t be attending, that cuts down severely on the possibility of new models appearing. Dacia, Renault's value-brand, is launching this 5 to 7 seater. IHS Markit, in its report, said VW, its premium subsidiaries Audi and Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes are unveiling a series of concept vehicles with much talk of autonomous transportation and electrification. Renault will unveil its electric Megane and its down-market subsidiary Dacia will unveil the Jogger, a 5-to-7 seater MPV. There may of course be some surprise unveilings.  “The show’s organizers wanted to create a show that put the industry’s shift towards mobility provision at the forefront while moving away from the traditional static, range display motor show, with the focus on 'innovations, not on complete product ranges.' Instead of room for a full model line, there will be room for conferences, press slots and networking,” according to the report.  “While traditional motor shows have seen falling attendances in recent years, both in terms of (manufacturers) and visitor numbers, it is hard to base a show entirely around demonstrations and the somewhat nebulous concept of ‘mobility’,” the report said. Renault Megane E-Tech CAR’s Dudenhoeffer, turning to the overall health of the global industry which reported “dazzling” profits for the first half of this year, said it will come under much pressure in the second half because of the shortage of high-tech chips, the weakening world economy in general and the slowing of the car market in China. Dudenhoeffer said in a report earlier this year that this would lose the global industry the production of 5.2 million vehicles in 2021. After that another crisis will loom – a shortage batteries for the burgeoning electric car market. “After the chip crisis, from 2024, an increasing global battery cell bottleneck must be expected,” Dudenhoeffer said.  Bear that in mind as manufacturers make big boasts about how electric and autonomous cars will transform their businesses.

"Corbis via Getty Images Over 100,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, and over 1,000 people are dying every day. These are people from all walks of life - rich and poor, white collar and blue collar, old and young. But according to an estimate from the Kaiser Family Foundation, over 98% of them have one thing in common: despite the ready availability of Covid vaccines, they chose not to get them.  The fact that Covid-19 has become a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” has been well-covered, and it dominates communications from public health authorities. However, millions of Americans who are eligible for shots still choose not to get them, and FDA approval of Pfizer’s vaccine doesn’t seem to have changed the rate of vaccinations nor people’s views on getting it. Some of those sitting out the shot are adamantly opposed to the vaccine while others claim to still be on the fence. Here’s a look at the adults who are still refusing to get a Covid vaccine, according to an analysis of nationwide polls.    Getty Images  AFP via Getty Images Why are people not getting vaccinated?

"TOKYO, JAPAN - AUGUST 28: Marcel Hug of Team Switzerland celebrates after winning gold in the Men’s ... [+] 5000m - T54 Final on day 4 of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 28, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Naomi Baker/Getty Images) As the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics draw to a close today, many will recollect some of this year’s highlights and look ahead to the next games due to be held in Paris in a little under three years from now. The closing of the Games routinely invites pause for reflection but this has surely been intensified this year by the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in the competition taking place in empty arenas without spectators. This year’s Paralympics was also a launchpad for the WeThe15 campaign – a decade-long commitment to strive for greater disability inclusion across society. Yet, for disability inclusion as it is understood today, as opposed to 1960 when the first Paralympics was staged, is the idea of an entirely separate Games exclusively for athletes with disabilities just an anachronism? Emphasizing uniqueness and difference may have been integral to getting the Paralympics off the ground back then and creating public awareness.  However, it may be argued that having an entirely separate Games runs counter to modern-day thinking around inclusivity.  Rather, it fosters palpable othering of the disability community, given that the Paralympics has always represented an identifiable touchpoint between this community and wider society. This is brought into even sharper focus when one considers that Olympic competition is already split between men and women, and then in some Olympic sports such as boxing and martial arts by weight too.  Would the next logical step not then simply be to incorporate Parasports into these classifications to allow athletes to all compete for their countries under the same proud banner?  Currently, the Olympics and Paralympics are run by two separate and distinct bodies in the form of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) respectively. There exists a Memorandum of Understanding between the 2 organizations to maintain the current model of separate games but continued cooperation until at least 2032. One of the arguments in favor of having a fully integrated and inclusive Olympics is that it might lead to better investment in Parasport at a national level. For example, if there was a joint medals table with equal weighting for Parasport, countries might be encouraged to invest more heavily in disability sport and their own Paralympians to avoid their medals haul being dragged down. For spectators and TV viewers alike, there may also be something rather enticing about watching Parasports and regular competitions taking place side-by-side at the same venue on the same day. Part of the beauty of the Paralympics is the sheer human endeavor and ingenuity of the athletes’ adaptations. What better way to showcase this than by having them compete directly alongside their compatriots? Anita Choudhrie is the Founder of Path to Success, a UK-based philanthropic venture campaigning for greater investment in disability sport.  The organization also supports a number of female Paralympians including powerlifter Louise Sugden who won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Paralympics and wheelchair tennis partners Lucy Shukur and Jordanne Whiley who won a silver medal. Choudhrie is a strong advocate of a fully integrated Olympics, “Why should we be making our Paralympians feel so different instead of including them in such a major world event as the Olympic Games?” she asks. “It would be wonderful for them to feel part of the grandness of the Olympics, part of the euphoria, rather than just something tagged on at the end,” Choudhrie adds.  Most of the arguments in favor of maintaining the status quo of two distinct Games separated by a 2-week buffer revolve around pragmatic considerations, with cost being chief amongst them. The Tokyo Olympic Village was built to house around 11,000 athletes but holding the Olympics and Paralympics concurrently would necessitate an extra 6,500 capacity. This would significantly drive up the construction costs of the Olympic Village alongside the necessity to recruit more staff and utilize further supporting infrastructure within the host city. Full integration could also result in Olympic and Paralympic events having to compete for TV viewers and media coverage. An issue that is neatly sidestepped by running the games consecutively. The risk is always that the Paralympics could get swamped and lost in the noise and fanfare of its mainstream counterpart.  Craig Spence, Chief Brand and Communications Officer at the IPC illustrates this by positing an alternative timeline for recent Olympic history. “if you could imagine going back to London 2012. And you have Jonnie Peacock lined up to run the 100 meters in that magical race that got all the headlines.  “So, Jonnie wins Gold, the crowd goes wild. An hour later, Usain Bolt takes the track and wins Gold in the 100 meters. What do you think the world's media focus on the next day?” Notwithstanding these practical considerations, Spence believes the Paralympics should proudly own its separate and unique identity, rather than seeking to be subsumed into something bigger but not necessarily better. “Anyone who’s ever been to an Olympic and Paralympic Games will tell you that there’s a very different feeling to both Games, very different vibes,” says Spence. “The Olympics is a very corporate event nowadays but the Paralympics is totally the opposite. It’s one of the few global events you can go and watch with every generation of your family. It’s imperative for us to be a fully accessible event and that includes affordability.” “The fact is that we’re just 2 different brands,” continues Spence. “We have two different messages. Ours is all about how transformation and change start with sport. The Olympics is all about Faster, Higher, Stronger, Together.""  There is perhaps no entirely satisfying right or wrong answer as to whether the Olympics and Paralympics should be merged. It boils down to priorities and perspectives. Are financial considerations paramount or should inclusion in the fullest sense be pushed at all costs? Who are the true primary stakeholders of the Paralympics?  Is it the athletes who train through blood, sweat and tears to make it onto the world stage, or the too often invisible 15% of the world’s population living with a disability that the sporting prowess of those remarkable competitors helps shine a light on, for 2 weeks every four years at least? What is certain, to use a sporting analogy, is that disability inclusion is rarely fought for on a level playing field. Equality is always the goal but the game itself is often insurmountably fixed.  Therefore, tempering idealism with a dose of cold hard pragmatism might be the most appropriate formula for a society that is hopefully evolving to become more inclusive but still has a long way to go.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/gusalexiou/2021/09/05/sporting-apartheid---should-the-paralympics-be-scrapped-and-merged-into-the-main-games/,“Sporting Apartheid” — Should The Paralympics Be Scrapped And Merged Into The Main Games?
"Creative Director John Murdy on the red carpet at Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios ... [+] Hollywood. “I know people are dying to be scared,” affirmed John Murdy, the creative director of Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood. “This is a tradition for a lot of people and a lot of families, and they come every year.”  “They love the holiday, they love the event, and people are so hungry for this. It was so traumatic for them when it was canceled last year. We’ve had time to think a lot about the scares, so we’ll be ready to scare the living daylights out of people.” Halloween Horror Nights, which kicks off on Thursday, September 9, 2021, has become an institution over the years. The 2020 event was shelved due to the pandemic marking the first time since 1997 that Halloween Horror Nights didn’t happen at the theme park. Getting this year’s extravaganza off the ground offered up a whole new set of challenges. “Learning how to work remotely was a big change for a lot of people,” explained Murdy. “I’ve got a head start because I’ve been doing it for three years because I’m based in Ireland for a lot of the year. For everybody else, that was a huge adjustment. It was a weird year, especially when you’re building the mazes and I’m asking people to walk through them and hold up the phone, so I could try to look at things. It was so impressive how quickly people adapted to it. It didn’t feel disconnected.” “We’d usually have floor plans and recreations and lists of things we’d have to make or buy and source, and that would involve a bunch of us in a conference room. This year we did it via video conference. My kids crashed so many meetings, and we got a kitten which perched on my shoulder for the entire meeting, everybody was so distracted by the cute little thing, and we couldn’t get any work done.”  One of the highlights of this year’s Halloween Horror Nights, and a maze that Murdy is particularly proud of, is The Haunting of Hill House. It’s based on the acclaimed and wildly popular Netflix 
  
  NFLX 
  show created and directed by Mike Flanagan.  “When it came out, I said to Mike that it elevated the genre. It’s a slow burn. It reminds me of The Shining and movies from that era where it’s a build, and I wanted the maze to reflect that aesthetic of the show,” Murdy enthused. “There are a whole lot of effects that we do in this maze, where things disappear, you see ghosts, and then we start going for the throat.” Flanagan was recently given a tour of the Hill House maze and gave it his approval. “That’s always the ideal, and it’s always great. Thankfully it happens frequently. A lot of times, the first thing I hear a filmmaker say when they come to one of our mazes is that it feels like they are back on set,” said Murdy. “The first thing I ask filmmakers is if you ever been to the event, and Mike was like, ‘Oh, yeah, I come all the time. I’ve always wanted one of my properties to be part of it.’ We’re thrilled to have him.”  Just one of a myriad of scares that await guests at 'The Haunting of Hill House.' The Haunting of Hill House was the first of this year’s mazes to be announced. It revolves around the Crain family confronting the home’s ghoulish inhabitants, and the mazes will involve guests doing likewise. As guests move through the attraction, they will encounter The Tall Man, The Ghost in the Basement, The Bent-Neck Lady, and journey through the heart of Hill House, the Red Room, and the Hall of Statues. “The very first thing that happens when you come in the maze is you hear Nell making her desperate phone call to her father, played by Timothy Hutton in the show, asking if he remembers The Bent-Neck Lady and saying that she’s back,’ Murdy explained. “You hear all the paranormal sound effects, and there is this scrim illusion of a red door that we light from the back, but then it disappears, so you see The Bent-Neck Lady behind it. We’re also using HVAC to blow cold air on the back of your neck and to help set the mood. Hill House is a lot different than a lot of horror properties.” “A big part of this maze was trying to nail all the details of the series. One of the first things I noticed when I watched it was the production design. It was really beautiful. We even sourced the exact same wallpaper. It was funny to walk Mike through it recently because he saw that and was just like, ‘Oh my God, it feels like I’m on set.’ My art director, Chris, and his team are good at finding things like that. He’s got a vintage company that has old 50s and 60s wallpaper, and if he can find enough of it, he can reproduce it. Mike was tripping out about the stained glass windows we created too.” Murdy added, “Towards the end of Hill House, we circle back to the Red Room, but we actually go in. That’s where we wanted to pay homage to the hidden ghosts in the show that, through the years, are stuck in this house. The whole room changes, and you see they are standing all around you. It’s the final scene in the maze, but with Halloween Horror Nights, we often like to do the final scare and then the final final scare. With Hill House this year, we did the final scare and the final final scare, but we also did the final final final scare and the final final final final scare.” Life's a scream at 'The Haunting of Hill House.' The creative director firmly believes that the devil is in the details when it comes to giving ticket holders the scariest bang for their buck. The creation of The Haunting of Hill House was no exception.  “We do painstaking research on every property that we’re going to feature in the event,” Murdy revealed. “I’m the worst person to watch a movie with because it’ll take me all day to go through just one. I’m breaking it down and writing my notes and stuff. It’s going to take me eight hours to get through. You take Hill House, and that’s over ten hours of show before you start. That’s a lot of research. I’m writing timecode notes for my audio people where I want them to replicate a sound effect that happens in episode four at 36 minutes and 42 seconds. I log the whole thing.” “We get all the photo research, which, on a typical movie, it’s probably 30,000 to 40,000 pictures, and we go through to select the ones we need to bring it to life. With Hill House, some scenes take place elsewhere that are scary but take place off the property. We decided early on that we were going to stay within the walls of the house. It just made sense to its core as the classic haunted house book, the movies, and then TV series. The house is the star.” But Hill House isn’t the only star of Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood this year. Michael Myers returns in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, The Exorcist possesses a spot in the line-up after being a big hit at the 2016 event, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre creates a buzz with horror fans once again.  “There are some changes, there are some tweaks, but some of them are pretty close to what they were,” Murdy confirmed. “I call it comfort food. People have been deprived of Halloween, and people have been deprived of Halloween Horror Nights. In all the years that have passed, from whatever surveys we’ve done with our fans, I guarantee you every year if you ask people what they want to see, both Michael Myers and Leatherface are up there. That does not change. The latest hit movie or TV show might pop up on that list, but the classic slasher films, people want them. It’s like coming home, and this year is all about coming back to the thing that you love.”  “The Exorcist, which we haven’t done since 2016, is also back. People have been asking for that because they loved it, or they were maybe too young for it the first time we featured it. Having those properties as the anchor of the event is great. There is also new stuff for people to see like Hill House and The Bride of Frankenstein Lives.” Elsa Lanchester and Boris Karloff in 'Bride of Frankenstein.' Universal Monsters: The Bride of Frankenstein Lives has a special place in Murdy’s heart. As with previous Universal Monsters mazes, legendary guitarist Slash provides the soundtrack. “It’s the third time we’ve been able to feature the Universal Monsters, and that’s incredibly gratifying. We had a meeting with the team in Orlando, and we got talking about the legacy, and the subject of The Bride came up. We all immediately gravitated to that,” Murdy gushed. “First of all, it’s a female monster, and there are not a lot of those, especially back in the original days of horror, but she got the short end of the stick when it came to screen minutes. She’s only in Bride of Frankenstein for maybe five to seven minutes at the end of the movie?”  “I guarantee that if you go pretty much anywhere in LA, you will see people with Bride of Frankenstein tattoos or t-shirts because she’s so iconic. This is a cool, modern way to tell a female-centered monster story and take a character that’s been on the sidelines for decades and elevate her to a starring role in a sequel that picks up right after the original movie. Then we connected that to an all-female scare zone of lesser-known Universal Monster characters such as She-Wolf of London or Dracula’s Daughter.” This year’s event will also see the return of another popular and highly lucrative horror franchise, The Purge. The five-film series has grossed $528.2 million at the worldwide box office. Terror Tram: The Ultimate Purge will put guests in the middle of the action on the studio’s backlot, where they’ll try to evade the horde who want The Purge to go on forever, and not just one night a year. “We’re also working in an era where there are a lot of really visionary auteur filmmakers in horror,” Murdy concluded. “The last five years in particular, as streaming started to expand, there’s so much content coming out, and that’s fabulous for us. To go full circle, The Haunting of Hill House is a great example of that.” “Netflix has really invested in horror, and we’ve worked with them a couple of times in the last three years. Mike Flanagan is a writer, director, editor, producer, so it’s great to have him on the set and have him be so enthusiastic about what we do. Of course, everything we do comes from what he, and people like him, have created. Our job is to try to reproduce that as closely as we possibly can, and that’s a real honor and a privilege.” Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood kicks off on Thursday, September 9, 2021, and will run on select nights through Sunday, October 31, 2021.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2021/09/04/its-a-hell-of-a-year-for-fear-at-halloween-horror-nights/,It’s A Hell Of A Year For Fear At ‘Halloween Horror Nights’

On MSNBC’s The Cross Connection, Cross said Justice Barrett’s membership in the group gave her little confidence the court would find the Texas law unconstitutional. “I know they haven’t ruled on it, but they can rule later.

"Signage reading 'SmartFuel Hydrogen Technology' at the newly opened hydrogen fueling station, ... [+] operated by Saudi Aramco, in the Air Products New Technology Center in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday, June 27, 2021. Saudi Aramco outlined plans to invest in blue hydrogen as the world shifts away from dirtier forms of energy, but said it will take at least until the end of this decade before a global market for the fuel is developed. Photographer: Maya Siddiqui/Bloomberg My previous article — How Blue Hydrogen Can Help Decarbonize The Economy — generated a lot of feedback and discussion on social media. Today I had intended to provide specific examples of how some companies are using hydrogen to improve Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) metrics. However, given the amount of feedback generated from the previous article, I will use today’s article to address some of the comments.  Multiple people pointed to the recent report from researchers at Cornell and Stanford Universities that criticized the idea of blue hydrogen. I can only assume they didn’t read to the end of the previous article, because I explicitly addressed this report. I provided one critique of that report, but here I will provide another. Michael Liebreich, among other things, is the founder and senior contributor of BloombergNEF. He is extremely active in the areas of cleantech and climate change, and widely-respected in the energy sector.  Here is Michael’s critique of this paper on LinkedIn. I encourage you to read the full critique. As he notes, he is “not in the business of promoting blue hydrogen”, but he adds: “The flaws and cherry-picking of data in the Jacobson/Howarth paper are trivial to spot for anyone with an energy or engineering background; I was not the only person who immediately pointed out the problems on Twitter - others included David Joffe, Thunder Said Energy, Gniewomir Flis, Philip Sargent, SINTEF Energy Research and Alex Trembath.” He summarized his critique on Twitter: “We do not have the luxury of consigning technologies to the dustbin because they (or the companies that own them) fail a socio-political purity test.” So the paper isn’t quite the bombshell some might think. The methods and conclusions are hotly disputed, even by people who otherwise have no interest in blue hydrogen. The paper will be supported by people who oppose blue hydrogen, but it won’t likely convince the undecided.  Multiple people pointed out that carbon sequestration has a poor track record. There is some merit to this criticism. It is true that many carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects have failed.  You can think of CCS like this. A coal-fired power plant generates a lot of carbon dioxide. If you could capture that carbon after combustion, and prevent it from entering the atmosphere, then that would be successful CCS. The problem is that it isn’t economical to simply capture the carbon dioxide from a power plant, compress it, and then inject it into a storage cavern (or react it to produce solid calcium carbonate). There are also concerns that if carbon dioxide is injected into a storage cavern, that it could seep out over time.  Thus, to date most projects attempting to do this have failed, and that has caused many to rightly view CCS with great skepticism.  However, there a number of projects that do capture carbon dioxide and utilize it for other purposes. This 2019 article highlighted 18 such projects. In many cases the captured carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which isn’t the same thing as simply locking it up long term.  With EOR, some of the carbon dioxide will remain in the ground, and some will come back up with the oil. But by using the carbon to produce more fossil fuels, critics argue that this can’t reasonably be considered CCS. In practice, companies can get partial credit for carbon sequestered by EOR.  The CCS piece of this has to work in order for blue hydrogen to work. If the carbon capture and storage rates aren’t high — and there are significant fugitive emissions — then the criticisms are valid. However, producing hydrogen from methane has a substantial advantage over capturing the carbon emitted from coal combustion. First, coal consumption produces over twice the carbon dioxide per unit of power produced, relative to natural gas (Source). That means you have a lot less carbon that has to be dealt with when producing blue hydrogen. Second, during the purification of blue hydrogen, the carbon is separated from the hydrogen. So, the process itself creates a highly-concentrated stream of carbon dioxide that can be easily separated. That’s another substantial advantage of attempting CCS with natural gas instead of coal.  Thus, it isn’t necessarily comparable to view CCS attempts with natural gas against historical failures of CCS with coal.  There is simply no time, according to some, to waste with blue hydrogen when we need to move directly to completely renewable sources of energy. Plus, too much new infrastructure would be required to create a blue hydrogen industry.  This was similar to criticisms of the electric power industry when it migrated in large numbers from coal to natural gas as an energy source. There were those who said that this move simply traded one fossil fuel for another, and thus didn’t substantially address the issue of carbon emissions. They argued it would be better to move from coal directly to renewables. The problem with this line of argumentation is that renewable sources weren’t capable of replacing coal-fired power plants. They could supplement them, but coal provides large-scale firm power. You can only replace that with intermittent power, such as that from wind and solar power, by overbuilding capacity and installing lots of storage. But those were simply not economical options. Thus, if the natural gas option wasn’t there, those power plants likely would have continued to use coal. Instead, they replaced with natural gas, and that was the primary reason the U.S. experienced the largest decline of carbon emissions over the past 15 years of any country in the world. That’s the risk of making the perfect the enemy of the good. The “perfect” in this case may be renewables, but since that wasn’t an option that was technically and economically feasible, demanding the perfect would have ensured that U.S. emissions remained high. By accepting the “good” of natural gas over coal, U.S. emissions substantially declined. The infrastructure criticism is much ado about nothing. Substantial hydrogen infrastructure already exists. Hydrogen pipelines already exist. And, as I will cover in the next article, hydrogen can be blended in small quantities into existing natural gas pipelines.  Some correctly noted that it takes more energy to produce hydrogen from natural gas than it does just to burn the natural gas. This is true even when considering just the production of hydrogen, and before adding additional energy requirements for the capture and sequestration of the carbon. But simply burning natural gas makes it more difficult to capture and store the carbon dioxide. Separating the hydrogen is what makes that possible.  Further, we have numerous industrial processes that are effectively energy sinks. Consider the production of plastics. Lots of energy goes into producing the plastics, but then that energy remains embedded in the plastics. It’s a net energy sink.  So the relevant issue isn’t that it takes more energy to produce hydrogen than to burn natural gas. That’s true, but what is gained in the process? The ability to easily separate out the carbon. That is a substantial benefit derived from that extra energy expenditure.  There are some valid criticisms of blue hydrogen, and some that aren’t as valid. The main one that has merit is that blue hydrogen doesn’t work unless the vast majority of the carbon is being captured and stored. This is admittedly still an open question. But regardless of those who argue that hydrogen is a dead end that shouldn’t be pursued, the reality is that it is being pursued. In the concluding article in this series, I will highlight the efforts of several companies in this area.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2021/09/04/addressing-blue-hydrogen-feedback/,Addressing Blue Hydrogen Feedback
"John Monopoly, pictured in the army green hoodie, joined Village to work on increasing Black equity ... [+] in the cannabis industry. (Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage) Just 3% of the cannabis industry’s market share is currently owned by Black people. Village is a national conglomerate fighting for equity for Black-owned brands, and Kanye West’s manager, John Monopoly, just joined the team. Former NBA player Al Harrington and Dan Pettigrew co-founded Village two years ago when they realized there was a lack of Black entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of color in the cannabis space. “We eventually see our company as being, almost, a distributor throughout this space. And we want to be able to help as many people of color be able to enter into the cannabis space and actually be able to be successful at it,” Harrington said. The lack of racial diversity in the market is often credited to financial barriers to entry. Startup costs to open a dispensary can be hundreds of thousands if not over of a million dollars.  But there’s community trauma as well. There can be hesitation and fear around starting a business within an industry that has historically criminalized your community. “Statistics show that while Black people were nearly four times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, they make up only a small number of those profiting from the multibillion dollar legalized pot industry,” a Wall Street Journal video explains. In the future, Harrington said Village will provide educational content as well since resources on how to jump through all the hoops needed to open a cannabis business are often lacking. Al Harrington, one of the cofounders of Village, is excited to be bringing entertainers and athletes ... [+] together to push for racial equity in the cannabis market. (Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage) “One of the things that I don't like about athletes and entertainers is a lot of times we don't work together. And you know, we talk about it all the time,” Harrington said, “but a lot of times it doesn’t happen.” Monopoly, who manages Kanye West, has decades of experience in the music industry. As he joins Village, he is bringing the power of his experience and connections within music. His vision for Village is all about maximizing impact by uniting people from across industries. “We plan to use all of our skill sets to support each other’s initiatives. With the team’s strong knowledge and expertise in the space coupled with my 30-year-plus career centered in music and culture, we plan to use expertise, influence and access to grow and develop a cannabis brand that will be inclusive and impactful,” Monopoly said in an emailed statement. “Our plan is two-fold,” Monopoly said. “Firstly, Village is 100% minority owned. By adding local minorities through partnerships with each individual state we’re in, we will ultimately increase Black ownership in every state where we operate.” Monopoly said the second part of Village’s strategy “expands beyond ownership directly in Village by affiliating with Black and minority owned cannabis brands that we can onboard in the states where we own licenses.” Village recently added former NBA player Wilson Chandler’s cannabis brand, Nobody’s Home, to its roster. The dispensary and lifestyle brand is based out of Benton Harbor, Michigan, where Chandler is from.  Being part of Village, Chandler said, means having extra support and constantly learning from Harrington by “going through the fire with him and seeing him build his brand and build his business.” Wilson Chandler's dispensary and lifestyle brand named Nobody's Home recently joined Village's ... [+] roster. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images) To kick off their partnership, Chandler put together a free music festival in Benton Harbor, happening Labor Day weekend and featuring artists like Rick Ross, G Herbo, Chase B and Freddie Gibbs.  Music moguls like Jay-Z, who launched a fund to help minority-owned cannabis startups, have also put their resources to increasing Black equity in this industry.  Village isn’t the first case where entertainers push for equity in the cannabis industry. But, Village says it’s the largest conglomerate working on the issue and is bringing leaders together from different industries.  As the group grows, its ability to bring power players together from different industries will determine how powerful it can grow and, thus, how much Village can influence a more equitable cannabis industry.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreabossi/2021/09/04/the-cannabis-industry-has-a-big-problem-kanyes-manager-just-joined-a-company-fixing-it/,The Cannabis Industry Has A Big Problem.

"Infowars founder Alex Jones recently appeared to take ivermectin during his show Infowars. (Photo by ... [+] Sergio Flores/Getty Images) If you typically take medical advice from Alex Jones, then maybe you have already seen Friday’s episode of his show Infowars.  On the episode, Jones showed his package. Actually, he showed two packages. One of the packages seemed to contain 3 mg doses of ivermectin, the other 4 mg doses of the corticosteroid methylprednisolone. As you can see in the video accompanying the following tweet, he then appeared to put one of the ivermectin pills into his mouth and down it with a chaser from a green bottle: Of course, you can’t tell for sure that it’s actually ivermectin that Jones took. After all, you aren’t Jones’ stomach, and here’s a shocker: not everything seen on TV is real. Yes, not every bachelorette chosen by The Bachelor is really in love with the bachelor on that “reality” TV show. Similarly, it can difficult to tell whether someone ingested a a deworming medication versus a breath mint versus an erectile dysfunction medication on TV.  Nevertheless, Jones accompanied his swallowing with, surprise, surprise, a rant: “See this? See this Fauci? You see this Bill Gates. I'm going to kill those prions, you [expletive] murderers, you're going to hit me with a bioweapon? You monster.”  OK, to be clear, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not a prion. Calling the Covid-19 coronavirus a prion would be like calling your bed a toilet. “Honey, let’s go bed” would be very different from “Honey, let’s go to the toilet.” So would, “I just dropped a deuce in the toilet” versus, well you get the picture.  Prions are not the same as viruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes prions as “abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins that are found most abundantly in the brain.” The name prion comes from “proteinaceous infectious particle.” A prion is smaller than a virus, can only be seen through an electron microscope, and do not contain nucleic acid, which is different from viruses that do. Jones continued his rant with, “You want to suppress me? You want to kill me? You son of a [expletive]! You [expletive] demon. You think I'm easy to kill? Think I'm going to roll over to your [expletive]?” Jones then chanted “Nobel Prize winning for humans! Nobel Prize winning for humans! Nobel Prize winning for humans!” Of course, William C. Campbell, PhD, and Satoshi Ōmura, PhD, did win the the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work developing avermctin/ivermectin. However, what Jones should have chanted based on the actual Nobel prize press release was “Nobel Prize winning for discovering a new drug, avermectin, the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of River Blindness and Lymphatic Filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases but the Covid-19 coronavirus is not a parasite! Nobel Prize winning for discovering a new drug, avermectin, the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of River Blindness and Lymphatic Filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases but the Covid-19 coronavirus is not a parasite!”  That may be more difficult to say than “she sells seashells by the seashore,” and not have the same theatrical effect, though. Just because something won a Nobel Prize to treat one disease, doesn’t mean that it works against all diseases. Joe Rogan, seen here interviewing Israel Adesanya during the UFC 263 ceremonial weigh-in, recently ... [+] said that he has Covid-19 and is taking ivermectin for it. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC) Then Jones began mentioning Joe Rogan, who hosts the popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. This is presumably because Rogan recently revealed that he was taking ivermectin after being diagnosed with Covid-19, as Joe Walsh reported for Forbes. Jones said the following about Anthony Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID): “And Joe Rogan kicked your murdering ass, too. You'd love to bury him, too, you little monster maggot.” Jones then claimed that people have been calling him and Rogan “so dumb” and “they’re both going to be dead.” He followed that by saying, “Yeah, that's why Joe's worth like $300 million, yeah, he's real stupid. That's why he lives in a $60 million house on the river.” Is that the money argument? The argument that having more money and a nicer house means that you are better than everyone else, that you know more than everyone else, at least more than people with less money and a worse house, perhaps a van down by the river?Jones failed to mention that Gates has even more money than Rogan and may have a more expensive house as well. Jones added this about Rogan, “He's the one that headlines with Dave Chappelle, not you. You're stupid.”  Well that’s unfortunate for all the “not headlining with Dave Chappelle” people, which probably includes most of Jones’s viewers and most of everyone for that matter. Jones concluded the segment by yelling that Fauci “wants the planet for himself and he wants you dead! Well, guess what Fauci, we ain’t rolling over and dying so easily. You little murderer!” What the Fauci? Really, is that the endgame, Fauci wanting the planet all for himself? And for what reason? To say, “OK, Dave Chappelle, now that everyone’s no longer around, you have no choice but to headline with me? Oh, and that house by the river is mine.” The other thing that’s not clear from the episode is why exactly Jones was supposedly taking ivermectin. Does that mean he has Covid-19? Is he suggesting that people should be constantly taking ivermectin every day?  As I have written before for Forbes, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against taking ivermectin to prevent or treat Covid-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines say that there is not enough evidence to support ivermectin’s use. Jones putting what is supposedly ivermectin in his mouth really doesn’t prove anything. Neither does Rogan saying that he’s taken ivermectin. Just because a celebrity says that he or she is taking something doesn’t mean that you should take it. Heck who knows whether that celebrity is even taking that medication, that supplement, or whatever else. Instead, rely on real scientific sources like the NIH, the CDC, or the World Health Organization (WHO). Listen to real, trusted medical doctors who can provide legitimate scientific evidence. They may not have a $60 million house by the river. They may not have headlined with Dave Chappelle. But that doesn’t mean that they are stupid, right?",https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/09/04/alex-jones-appears-to-take-ivermectin-on-air-mentions-joe-rogan-during-covid-19-rant/,"Alex Jones Appears To Take Ivermectin On Air, Mentions Joe Rogan, During Covid-19 Rant"
"Used with permission of TLBK, LLC Following last week’s two appointments to New York State’s new Office of Cannabis Management, local experts and New York Cannabis United (NYCU) members Michelle Smoler, Tosin Ajayi, and Ryan Lepore weighed in on Gov. Kathy Hochul’s progress so far, and the need to fill New York’s Cannabis Control Board before NY can get down to business. Check out their full op-ed (and bios) below. On Wednesday, Sept. 1, the New York State Senate convened a special session to appoint Tremaine Wright and Chris Alexander to lead the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM), the regulatory agency responsible for launching New York’s legal cannabis industry. This announcement marks the end of a six-month delay following the momentous passage of the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA) into law and signals to New Yorkers that our new governor Kathy Hochul, unlike her predecessor, is serious about implementing this landmark cannabis legislation. But with 4 seats still vacant in New York’s Cannabis Control Board (CCB), the work is nowhere near done. As the new Chair and Executive Director of the CCB and OCM, respectively, Wright and Alexander bring years of commitment to public service and a track record for sustaining the integrity of the cannabis industry. The MRTA is celebrated as the most progressive cannabis legalization bill in the country, and only with the right leaders will the full scope of legal protections, benefits, and societal impacts from this law be realized. OCM’s incoming leadership will collectively draft the rules and regulations that will govern New York’s cannabis industry going forward using their discretion and interpretations of the law. Even with two reputable leaders at the helm, the future of New York’s adult-use industry — whether it serves as a fresh start or continues to stigmatize the cannabis plant and those who grow, process, sell, and consume it — is still at stake. We must continue to appoint leaders to OCM who will use their position to uphold the intent of the MRTA and deliver New Yorkers the industry we fought for. Establishing a cannabis regulatory framework in New York rooted in justice, equity, and sustainability will not only disrupt decades of BIPOC trauma caused by the State’s unjust drug policies but could also interrupt the perpetual horrors of prohibition experienced across the entire nation. Every day without this framework in place prolongs the cycle of trauma and criminalization, exposing legacy market operators to law enforcement and denying New Yorkers access to the effective and affordable medicine and harm reduction resources they need. Absent responsible leadership, interest groups with money and access will continue to shape the cannabis landscape as they see fit and New York will be the latest in the U.S. to set up an industry that caters to lining the pockets of the most privileged among us. With Hochul’s attention turned toward cannabis, and two seats already confirmed to the OCM, cannabis advocates must continue to make our priorities unmistakable. We will not support OCM candidates nominated out of political convenience. New Yorkers demand leaders committed to the vision for New York’s cannabis industry outlined in the law — leaders who will place the interests of women and minority applicants, small businesses, financially distressed farmers, and communities harmed by prohibition at the forefront and make the training, education, and provision of resources to these groups a priority. We require leaders with vision, who will understand the harms large-scale indoor cultivation will inflict on our climate, natural and built-environments and make environmentally regenerative and sustainable practices the industry standard on Day One; leaders who understand how to transition New York’s existing multi-billion-dollar legacy market into a legal framework and establish realistic pathways for legacy operators and equity applicants to enter the new industry. Above all, these leaders must recognize how overly complex and punitive regulatory frameworks have undermined other states’ efforts to make their cannabis industries equitable and inclusive.  New York is not without qualified candidates and the Hochul administration should work with those who fought tirelessly to get the MRTA passed to identify the right people to lead the industry forward. If the governor and legislators can commit to swiftly appointing the remaining regulators and establishing a clear 18-month plan, we can create a fully functioning cannabis industry in New York close to the original timetable. In selecting Tremaine Wright and Chris Alexander to lead cannabis sales in New York, Governor Hochul has shown a commitment to the intent of our cannabis law beyond the expectations set by ex-Governor Cuomo. We are counting on her to continue championing this moment with the urgency and transparency it warrants and we too, as stakeholders in the design of the New York cannabis market, will continue to advocate for smart, forward-thinking candidates to lead the Office of Cannabis Management. The groundwork is laid — if we continue to work together we can ensure that New York’s emerging cannabis industry is a success. Michelle Smoler is a medical cannabis patient and the President of NYU CannaPolicy at NYU Wagner, specializing in public policy. Tosin Ajayi co-owns the CBD company Holistic Remedies, LLC, and is an alumnus of NYU Wagner where she founded NYU CannaPolicy and specialized in nonprofit management. Ryan Lepore is the Interim Executive Director of NYC NORML, Board Member for Empire State Norml, and Director of Business Development at PrestoDoctor.  Together, they represent a dedicated group of New York cannabis law reform and advocacy organizations, trade associations, businesses, farmers, aspiring entrepreneurs, and concerned individuals who make up New York Cannabis United (NYCU).",https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2021/09/04/cannabis-community-to-ny-leaders-keep-the-appointments-coming/,Cannabis Leaders To NY Governor: Keep Those Appointments Coming
"Free Guy In Friday box office news that isn’t Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings ($29.5 million on Friday for a likely $70 million Fri-Sun/$85 million Fri-Mon debut), 20th Century’s Free Guy continued to kick butt in China. The well-reviewed and well-received Ryan Reynolds/Jodie Comer video game comedy earned another $3.7 million on Friday (-27% from its opening day gross) and $8.2 million (-8.9%) on Saturday for a new $50.5 million cume.  It should pass The Croods: A New Age ($54 million) and Soul ($58 million) by Sunday or Monday, with Tenet ($66 million) next on the “list.” As frankly expected, this pop culture-specific, video game-entrenched crowdpleaser is performing quite well with a Chinese audience that craves either local Chinese tentpoles or genuinely “foreign” movies. Free Guy is a distinctly American popcorn movie, as was Ready Player One, Green Book and Zootopia.  Free Guy is also holding firm in North America as well, earning another $2.04 million (-43%) for a likely $11.58 million (-19%) fourth weekend for a $94.8 million 24-day cume. It’ll pass $100 million domestic sometime next week as it races to $300 million worldwide. Covid or no Covid, $300 million-plus for an over/under $115 million, original, star-driven high-concept flick is an absolute win. I’d have been happy with such a result even sans the variables related to Covid and the current climate change-related storms pummeling America at the moment.  We can debate the complicated issues at play with Disney moving forward with a Jungle Cruise sequel. The legs are great and it’ll have $107 million domestic tomorrow after a 7% drop in weekend six, but the Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt flick will barely top $200 million in global theatrical earnings (plus whatever it made on Disney+ Premier Access). Free Guy getting an eventual/likely sequel needs no detailed explanation other than “well-liked movie with fun characters made money in theaters.” Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Anthony McCoy in Candyman, directed by Nia DaCosta."" Universal’s Candyman took a somewhat expected drop on its second Friday, earning $2.81 million (-69%) for a likely $10.4 million (-54%) Fri-Sun/$13.26 million Fri-Mon second-weekend gross. The $25 million Nia DaCosta-directed horror sequel will have $42 million in 11 days. In other horror movie updates, Don’t Breathe 2 (which debuted on PVOD on Friday) will nab a likely $2.22 million (-22%) Fri-Sun/$2.78 million Fri-Mon frame. That’ll give the $10 million horror sequel a $28.6 million 25-day cume, or just above what the first Don’t Breathe opened with ($26 million) in August 2016.  Searchlight’s The Night House will have $6.4 million after 18 days following a $650,000 Fri-Mon frame while Old will earn $590,000 over the holiday for a $47.37 million (on an $18 million budget) domestic cume. Escape Room 2 has earned $25.4 million domestic (on a $15 million budget) while The Forever Purge will have $44.4 million (on a $25 million budget) by Monday. Paramount’s Paw Patrol (concurrently available on Paramount+) will earn $5.62 million over the holiday for a $32 million 18-day total, while MGM’s Respect will have $22.4 million after 25 days.  The Suicide Squad earned $220,000 (-60%) on Friday for a likely $1.24 million Fri-Mon weekend for a $54.7 million cume as it exits HBO Max. Black Widow will earn $1.05 million over the holiday in weekend nine for a $182.8 million cume, while Martin Campbell’s The Protégé will earn $720,000 over the Fri-Mon frame for a $7.09 million 18-day cume. Space Jam: A New Legacy will cross $70 million this weekend while A24’s The Green Knight will end Labor Day just under $17 million. F9 will earn $108,000 for a $172.89 million total. Poor, under-loved Reminiscence will earn $47,000 (-94%) in its third Fri-Sun frame for a $3.85 million cume.

"There’s a startling passage about the power of hospitality in the classic novella, The Ballad of the Sad Cafe. Carson McCullers writes (and I apologize for this paraphrase of a great work of art) that, for many people, the judgments and deprivations of the world they encounter every day make them feel that their lives aren’t valued by society and commerce.  Partaking of hospitality when they have the opportunity (in her example, spending an evening at a café) provides them with a time and place where, “for a few hours at least, the deep bitter knowing that you are not worth much in this world could be laid low.” It’s true that McCullers' vision of hospitality expects a lot from the customers as well. They tidy up as if they’re children going to dinner at a neighbor’s house; they wash up beforehand and “scrape their feet very politely on the threshold as they enter the cafe.”  Tour buses outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.  Unfortunately, it’s the rare customer-facing professional who can regale you with tales of customers politely wiping their feet and behaving like they're playing dress-up. Yet it's still worth remembering that service can be an occasion, a time when customers venture out—not only physically but mentally as well—in the hopes of an escape from the ways they’re being treated in other aspects of their lives.  Consider the realtor leading her umpteenth house tour. Can she can remind herself of how big deal a deal this is (the process, not just the result) for her new-homeowners-to-be?  Likewise, can the IT professional troubleshooting yet another laptop can keep in mind that the employee being helped is looking forward to tomorrow’s big (to them) presentation?  And can the lawyer working on yet another last will and testament keep in mind all the ways they can increase their client's feeling of dignity during the process?  If they succeed in doing so, they'll be realigning themselves with the experience of the customer or guest. And this can be powerful indeed.  **** My favorite quote on the reframed viewpoint we should be striving to bring to our work every day comes from a bus-tour operator and guide, and I'll never tire of quoting it:  ‘‘No matter how many times I’ve previously given a tour of the government sites in Washington, D.C., for example, I consciously work to remember that for this group of kids this tour will be their ﬁrst, and maybe only, glimpse of Washington in their entire lives.’’ Enough said.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2021/09/04/reframing-your-attitude-daily-to-take-a-customer-centric-point-of-view-in-customer-service-and--hospitality/,Reframing Your Attitude To Take A Customer-Centric View In Customer Service And Hospitality
"Katy (Awkwafina) and Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios. ©Marvel Studios 2021.  Maybe it’s not too late for Sony to move Venom: Let There Be Carnage back to September 24. Maybe the problem with the likes of Snake Eyes and The Suicide Squad was... Snake Eyes and The Suicide Squad. As with A Quiet Place part II, F9 and Black Widow, Walt Disney’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) is opening almost as well as it likely would have in normal circumstances. Marvel’s latest action fantasy is not just shattering existing Labor Day weekend records, it’s opening right in the realm of “business as usual” for an MCU movie. The previous Labor Day record was $26.5 million Fri-Sun and $30.5 million Fri-Mon for Rob Zombie’s Halloween in 2007. Destin Daniel Cretton’s Shang-Chi just nabbed $29.6 million yesterday. That’s essentially tied with the $29.86 million Friday debut for Universal’s F9 in late June and not far off from the $39.51 million opening day for Disney’s Black Widow in early July. That opening day total includes $8.8 million in Thursday previews, giving it a $21.2 million “pure Friday,” again just behind F9 ($22.76 million) and Black Widow ($26.3 million). The Simu Liu/Awkwafina/Tony Leung fantasy rode a wave of strong reviews (92% fresh and 7.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes), solid buzz and a “want to see” factor among multiple demographics (not just Asian Americans) to deliver an opening day gross amid Covid and climate change variables that was still right in line with a mid-level MCU flick. Fears that it would open lower than any previous MCU movie were entirely unfounded. Inflation notwithstanding, this is a bigger opening day than the $21-$25 million opening days of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Ant-Man. It’s within spitting distance of the $31-$39 million opening days of Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp and Black Widow. If it plays like Thor: The Dark World ($31.5 million Friday/$85 million Fri-Sun/$96 million Fri-Mon Veteran's Day weekend in 2013) or Black Panther over President’s Day weekend 2018 ($76 million Friday/$202 million Fri-Sun/$242 million Fri-Mon), we’re looking at a $90-$93 million Fri-Mon debut. If it merely legs like A Quiet Place part II ($57 million from a $19 million Friday this past Memorial Day weekend), Shang-Chi gets to $88 million.  Unless it completely capsizes after yesterday (unlikely, since it’s only in theaters and it’s quite good), we’re looking at a Fri-Mon total between the three-day totals of Ant-Man and the Wasp ($75 million) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95 million). And, yes, for anticipated films, folks who show up Fri-Mon otherwise would have shown up Fri-Sun. As far as Fri-Sun weekend figures, it looks to end up with around $70 million, tied with F9 and just over/under the likes of Thor ($65 million), Captain America ($65 million), Ant-Man and the Wasp ($75 million), Black Widow ($80 million), Thor: The Dark World ($85 million) and Doctor Strange ($88 million). As you’ll see, not every “new” MCU flick should be expected to perform like Black Panther or Captain Marvel.  Up until that sky-high performer, Doctor Strange held the record for a “new” (sans Iron Man) MCU origin story solo flick in late 2016. Right up until Black Panther, the record belonged to Iron Man ($102 million in 2008). Marvel had a Tony Stark ceiling up until Black Panther. Up until early 2017, the only non-Tony Stark MCU movies to breach even $715 million was Guardians of the Galaxy ($773 million in 2014). Up until early 2018, only Guardians 2 ($869 million) and Thor: Ragnarok ($854 million) cracked even $800 million. Even sky-high performances for Black Panther and Infinity War didn’t prevent Ant-Man and the Wasp ($216 million domestic and $620 million worldwide) from “only” performing about as well as Ant-Man ($180 million domestic and $519 million worldwide).  Credit goes to the usual places. Marvel has mastered the blockbuster fundamentals, guaranteeing at least a three-star experience for most general moviegoers. Shang-Chi is 95% stand-alone for those who haven’t been watching every single one and/or just wanted to see a mega-movie with a mostly Asian cast (R.I.P. Snake Eyes, yet more proof that diversity only matters for movies audiences already want to see). Shang-Chi so much better than the trailers that I’m half-convinced it was an Aladdin-style hustle. After all, if you know the audiences will show up, you can hide most of the goods and let them discover the movie as paying audience members. You pull that off, and you exponentially increase the buzz (including an A from Cinemascore), sense of viewer ownership and post-debut legs.  With little IP name recognition and few “general audiences know who this is” movie stars, there was always a chance that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was going to perform more like Ant-Man than Spider-Man: Homecoming ($881 million, with an assist from Iron Man) or Black Panther ($1.346 billion). That the film is thus far performing like a mid-range MCU movie even amid these unprecedented circumstances is something of an achievement, and a huge win on several fronts. It’s more evidence that A) theatrical exclusivity can matter, B) any weekend can host a boffo debut and C) at least some of the soft summer movie box office was due to the comparatively “soft” offerings. With $53 million worldwide thus far, James Bond is breathing a sigh of relief.

"The addition of DeAndre Jordan to the Los Angeles Lakers does not mean the team should move on from ... [+] Marc Gasol. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. The Los Angeles Lakers continue to stockpile talent reminiscent of everyone’s favorite All-NBA 2000’s and 2010’s teams. The Lakers’ latest high-profile addition will include DeAndre Jordan once he clears waivers, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. Jordan was traded from the Brooklyn Nets to the Detroit Pistons on Friday in a multi-pick, multi-player deal. Once he clears waivers — which he will due to his $20 million contract — the Pistons and Jordan will agree to a $16 million buyout. Jordan will then ink a one-year, $2.6 million deal with the Lakers. The former All-Star and All-NBA selection clearly is not the player he once was — a major reason why the Nets traded him with two years left on his deal — but he remains a physical, rim-rolling presence.  Since the Lakers allowed both JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard to depart following the team’s NBA Finals win in 2020 — Howard has since returned — the Lakers were missing that physical presence during the 2020-21 season. At the age of 33, Jordan’s defensive presence isn’t as intimidating as it once was. His total rebounding percentage of 18.9 was his lowest since the 2012-13 season and his defensive rating of 111.0 was the worst of his 13-year NBA career. But his ability to block shots — 1.9 blocks per 36 minutes, his highest since the 2016-17 season — and his ability to convert on second-chance and rim-rolling offensive opportunities — the 76.3 field goal percentage last season is the highest of his career and 127.0 offensive rating is the third-best of his career — remains elite. The addition of Jordan isn’t an all-out positive addition; the veteran center can’t convert on jump shots. His offensive limitations are well-known and his defensive tenacity isn’t as strong as it was during the peak of his career. This is a big reason why the Lakers should retain Marc Gasol moving forward. The common consensus has been now that Jordan will sign with the Lakers, the team will move on from Gasol — who was consistently in the dog house during his debut season in Los Angeles last year. While Gasol remains slow-footed and prone to inconsistent stretches — he shot 40.3 percent from the field before the All-Star break last season — he remains a floor-spacer. With Howard and Jordan as two of the top big men on the roster outside of Anthony Davis, it’s a major problem if the Lakers decide to cut Gasol. Especially when one considers the Lakers will feature Russell Westbrook at point guard, one of the least-efficient jump shooting starting point guards in the league. Although the Lakers have never fully been behind Gasol — they signed Andre Drummond in the middle of the season to replace him in the starting lineup — his offensive capabilities combined with his playmaking make him an asset. Gasol rebounded from his slow start to the 2020-21 season and shot 45.4 percent from the field for the season and 41.0 percent from beyond the arc. He also averaged 4.0 assists per 36 minutes. In addition, his 115.0 offensive rating was second on the team among rotation players and his defensive rating of 105.0 was the third-best among rotation players. The team’s second-best lineup last season featured Gasol at center alongside LeBron James and Davis, according to Cleaning the Glass. They outscored opponents by 12.8 points per 100 possessions.  Again, as unimpressive as Gasol may appear to be on the visual test, the guy remains a quality two-way player who clearly affects the Lakers’ other rotation players in a positive way. Once the signing of Jordan becomes official, the Lakers will have 14 guaranteed players under contract. They also have two other players under Exhibit-10 deals. Under NBA rules, the Lakers are allowed one more signing to reach a maximum limit of 15 active players on the roster. That means the Lakers don’t have to walk away from Gasol. For a team that struggled with 3-point shooting and spacing last season, moving on from Gasol due to the addition of Jordan would be a silly and unneeded move. Keep Gasol, leave that one roster spot open during the season for a potential high-profile addition, and maximize your team’s potential on the offensive and defensive end. Simply put, this should be a no-brainer for the Lakers.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2021/09/04/los-angeles-lakers-signing-of-deandre-jordan-should-not-signal-marc-gasols-departure/,Los Angeles Lakers’ Signing Of DeAndre Jordan Should Not Signal Marc Gasol’s Departure
"Shin Min-ah's character is at first suspicious of the handy man played by Kim Seon-ho. When Shin Min-ah’s character in Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha moves to the town of Gongjin, she’s quickly misunderstood by the locals. They think her character, Yoon Hye-jin, is coldhearted and superficial, but it’s Hye-jin’s efforts to protect a patient that force her to leave Seoul and seek a less expensive location for a dental clinic. “Yoon Hye-jin is a perfectionist who is extremely frank and has clear values,” said Shin. “She may come across as cold and stuck-up at first, but in reality, she is clumsy and soft-hearted. I find that really adorable about her and that’s what attracted me to the role.” The actress admits that she shares quite a few traits with her character. “I would say I’m 90% similar to Hye-jin,” Shin says with a laugh. “I may not be as straightforward as her, but I would like to see myself as soft-hearted and kind like her.” Shin has appeared in the many popular dramas, including My Girlfriend Is a Nine-Tailed Fox, Arang and the Magistrate, Oh My Venus, Chief of Staff and Tomorrow, With You, playing such interesting characters as a gumiho (mythological nine-tailed fox) and a Joseon-era ghost. Challenging roles offer her a chance to move out of her comfort zone. “I think there are times when I’m drawn to such roles, especially when I want to show a different side of me,” said Shin. “But I don’t always go for challenging roles. The most important question for me is how much I can relate to the character and how effectively I can portray the character.” Whether she’s playing a gumiho or a dentist, the actress devotes considerable time to thinking about her character before shooting starts. “When I first read the script, I try to find things that I can relate to,” said Shin. “After that, I spend the preparation period trying to better understand the story to develop deeper emotions about the role.” Shin’s meticulous preparations sometimes involve physical training. She learned to dive for her recent film Diva and went to action school for the film My Mighty Princess. While playing Hye-jin in Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha did not require physical training, she did visit dental clinics to observe dentists and patients.  “How they interact with the patients, what kind of facial expressions they have, their actions, and so on,” said Shin. “I also got a lot of advice from the dentists that I know. Apart from that, I spent a lot of time trying to really understand Hye-jin, since her emotional development plays a key role in the plot.” Shin Min-ah's character gets advice on how to fit in from Kim Seon-ho's character. Shin began her career as a model for a teen magazine and quickly became one of Korea’s most in-demand commercial models. After appearing in several music videos for the k-pop band g.o.d, she made her acting debut in 2001 in the melodrama Beautiful Days, then appeared in the martial arts comedy film Volcano High. Despite acting for 20 years, she still occasionally feels nervous.  “As an actress, I can’t avoid feeling nervous and under pressure in front of the camera,” said Shin. “But there are moments when I find myself having a blast experimenting different ways on set. It makes me realize I’m more relaxed than I used to be and it thrills me. Putting the pressure aside, I feel happy when I’m able to focus on finding better ways to portray the role.” In Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha her character encounters Gongjin’s ubiquitous handy man played by Kim Seon-ho. She doesn’t trust him at first, but he’s hard to avoid and it’s easy to see these characters are destined to find common ground. Kim attracted attention in 2020 when playing the second lead in the drama Start Up earned him loyal followers, as well as the nickname “good boy.”  “When I first saw Seon-ho on TV, he left such a refreshing impression on me and I became curious about him,” said Shin. “So I couldn’t have been more excited to get to work with him. He is brilliant in so many ways and also very thoughtful. He really put me at ease working together on set.” Shin hopes that viewers will be as charmed by the story of Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha as she was. “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha sets itself apart because you get an intimate look at the colorful lives of the people living in Gongjin,” said Shin. “It’s also fun to watch the story of the main characters unfold through their interactions with their neighbors. That’s definitely something you can look forward to on our show.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2021/09/04/shin-min-ah-says-shes-a-lot-like-her-hometown-cha-cha-cha-character/,Shin Min-Ah Says She’s A Lot Like Her ‘Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha’ Character
"WWE is now set to lose Daniel Bryan to AEW. (Credit: Sarah Sachs/Arizona Diamondbacks/Getty Images) Former WWE Champion Daniel Bryan—now back to using his real name Bryan Danielson—is indeed jumping ship to AEW. According to a report from the latest Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t WrestlingNews.co), the debut of Danielson is “locked in” as AEW’s “big surprise” for Sunday’s All Out pay-per-view: “Dave Meltzer confirmed in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter that the big surprise for All Out, Bryan Danielson, is locked in for Sunday night.” Cassidy Haynes of BodySlam.net broke the news last month that Bryan was AEW-bound, noting that Danielson inked a deal with AEW and would be making “comparable money” to what he was making in WWE while getting the added benefits of more creative input and the freedom to wrestle in Japan. According to Haynes, initial plans called for Danielson to debut on AEW Dynamite late next month, but plans changed and Haynes reported a week ago that Danielson would make his first-ever AEW appearance at All Out in Chicago. Mat Men podcast’s Andrew Zarian recently reported that AEW would have a “few surprises” at All Out, and The Wrestling Observer Newsletter’s Dave Meltzer confirms that Danielson’s AEW debut will be one of those surprises. Danielson’s jump to AEW will mark the second marquee ex-WWE name to make the move to AEW in a matter of weeks following CM Punk’s return to pro wrestling after a seven-year hiatus. Much like Punk’s AEW debut—which, coincidentally, also took place in Chicago—Danielson’s switch to AEW has been one of the worst kept secrets in pro wrestling. AEW has done a masterful job of creating buzz for the debuts of Punk and Danielson, and Punk’s debut with the company on Rampage last month was a massive viewership hit that has created plenty of chatter in pro wrestling circle’s regarding just how close AEW is to truly challenging WWE for the top spot in sports entertainment. Of course, it will take more than a handful of marquee signings for that to happen, but Bryan’s signing is a smart move for AEW. Danielson has a proven history of being a top merchandise seller and a live event draw, and he is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable pop culture stars in all of pro wrestling, thanks at least in part to his relationship with Brie Bella and his role on the E! reality show Total Bellas. Danielson’s move to AEW should garner plenty of publicity for the company while also giving the roster another top star to build around as it expands with a growing roster and the addition of a second weekly show. Follow-up, however, will be key. AEW has added a number of major names to its roster over the past year or so, including the likes of Christian Cage, Paul “Big Show” Wight and Malakai Black, who wrestled as Aleister Black in WWE. But even though AEW’s roster is incredibly talented and Danielson’s addition should only help bolster its star power, how Bryan is booked will go a long way in determining how fans react to his decision to make the move from WWE. While the initial pop for Danielson will be huge and early fan reaction will be strong, AEW must capitalize on Danielson’s strengths as one of the world’s top all-around performers to make the most of his signing.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2021/09/04/daniel-bryan-reportedly-set-for-aew-debut-at-all-out/,Daniel Bryan Reportedly Set For AEW Debut At All Out
"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' debuts this weekend, the latest installment in Disney's lucrative Marvel franchise. For Disney CEO Bob Chapek, this weekend’s debut of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a roll of the dice. It’s the first Marvel film to open on the normally anemic Labor Day weekend and its central character, a kung fu master in the mold of ‘70s martial arts icon Bruce Lee, is little-known. Its exclusive theatrical release, which Chapek himself called an “interesting experiment,” comes as Covid cases continue to spike.  The Chinese government has yet to approve the film for distribution in the world’s largest movie market, raising the stakes for Chapek. But Disney has built up quite a bit of wiggle room with its control of the 80-year-old comic-book publisher that writer Stan Lee and illustrator Jack Kirby put on the map: Purchased in 2009 for just $4 billion, Forbes estimates the company is now worth almost $53 billion, or about 16% of Disney’s market value. Not a bad return on an investment that few said would ever pay off.  “People didn’t fully understand and appreciate the franchise potential of the genre like we did,” says Tom Staggs, Disney's former chief financial officer who helped lead the acquisition. “We were able to buy it because the industry didn’t totally get it either.” Keeping that value may be one of the biggest challenges facing Chapek, the former theme park and consumer products executive who took over as CEO last year. He has already rankled Hollywood by taking on Scarlet Johansson, one of Marvel’s biggest stars , over compensation tied to the simultaneous theatrical and streaming release of Black Widow, including the contentious decision to disclose her $20 million salary for the role. That strategy also reportedly rankled Marvel Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige, who didn’t want to see the film downgraded to home streaming. Shang-Chi presented a different set of challenges for the filmmakers — knocking down problematic Asian stereotypes in the comic that may explain why China has yet to set a release date.  The performance of Shang-Chi will influence how Disney distributes the next Marvel installment, Eternals, due out Nov. 5.  It may well determine whether the company can adhere to its carefully choreographed schedule of Marvel stories, intended first to debut in theaters, then expanded on TV.  It was that kind of calculated control that turne a lean, independent studio operating above a Mercedes Benz dealership in Beverly Hills into the beating heart of the world’s biggest entertainment company. Twenty-four Marvel titles collectively grossed $21.9 billion in Disney’s hands, making it bigger than Bond, more potent than Potter and massive compared to The Fast And The Furious.  It’s also far better than Star Wars which Disney bought with its $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012, delivering box office sales of just $6 billion on the five films it produced. Its $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006 also pales, with the 21 Disney-owned films generating ticket sales of $14.4 billion. Marvel, says Comscore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian, is easily the most successful film franchise in history.  Here’s a look at Marvel by the numbers. FILM — Nearly $6 billion No. 1 Marvel Film: Avengers: Endgame, $2.8 billion Marvel superheroes have been a key piece of Walt Disney box office dominance in recent  years, giving the studio the two biggest movies of 2018 — Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther — and one of the highest-grossing films of all time — Avengers: Endgame — a year later. Since 2018, Disney has released seven Marvel films that have collectively brought in more than $9.4 billion, according to data from Comscore. That kind of dominance boosts the value of all its other films by driving up the price the company can get from cable TV networks like Starz or streaming services like Netflix to show them. Media analyst Richard Greenfield estimated the value of Disney’s 2012 Netflix deal, which provided the streamer with access to newly released films starting in 2016, would generate $450 million in revenue in its first year.  STREAMING — $40 billion+ Most-Watched Marvel Show: Loki  WandaVision. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Loki. Marvel shows have helped attract 12.4 million new subscribers to the Disney+ streaming service from April through June, bringing the total to 116 million as of July. The WandaVision debut was a Top 10 hit and which only got bigger with each one of its nine episodes — Nielsen estimates it was viewed by 30.5 million people. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier captured an audience of 28.3 million, Nielsen reported, while Loki, which debuted three months later, drew an even larger 35 million viewers, according to the measurement service. No surprise, ten more Marvel series are coming, including Ms. Marvel, the first Muslim-American superhero; Hawkeye, with actor Jeremy Renner reprising his Avengers’ expert marksman character; and She-Hulk, played by Emmy Award-winning Tatiana Maslany.  “The addition of the Marvel content ... is a tremendous catalyst of growth for us,” Chapek told investors in May, noting it built on the success of the Star Wars-inspired original series, The Mandalorian. Marvel’s Black Widow exceeded $125 million in sales on Disney+, where it premiered on the same day as the film’s theatrical release, sparking a high-profile battle with star Scarlett Johansson over profits that could well set a precedent for how talent is compensated in the streaming era. CONSUMER PRODUCTS — About $3 billion  No. 1 Selling Marvel Product: Super Heroes Avengers Iron Man Hall of Armor, $45 price Under Disney, sales of all things Marvel  — Spider-Man swim trunks, Hulk bedding, Winter Soldier and Captain America action figures — account for nearly $10 billion in licensing revenue from merchandise sales since 2010, according to Forbes calculations. Marvel Chairman Ike Perlmutter initially viewed toy sales as the profit driver for the company, with the films playing the role of marketing. Today it is making heaps of cash on both. Disney does not disclose what percentage of revenue is attributable to Marvel, though two people with direct knowledge say it’s second only to Disney’s classic characters (Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy) in revenue.   THEME PARKS — TBD First Marvel Attraction: Iron Man Experience, Hong Kong Disneyland Despite being in Disney hands for more than a decade, it’s still too early to estimate its value to the enterprise — but its six-acre Avengers Campus opened at Disneyland in June and is already drawing crowds who show up to interact with characters such as Iron Man, Thor, Captain Marvel or Black Panther. One attraction, the  Spider-Man Web Slingers ride, sends guests on a 3D mission to combat an infestation of Spider-Bots at the Headquarters, not far from the 2017 remake of the Twilight Zone-inspired Tower of Terror plunge that is now branded the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout dark ride. “They’ve done it right,” said Dennis Speigel, chief executive of International Theme Park Services consultancy. “There have been huge crowds and waits to get in.” Marvel is making its way around the world. An Ant-Man and The Wasp attraction opened in 2019 in Hong Kong Disneyland. Coming soon: Epcot Center’s Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind indoor roller coaster and an Avengers Campus concept at Disneyland Paris.  METHODOLOGY Disney doesn’t disclose Marvel’s value and analysts who cover the company haven’t done so independently, so to estimate its current value Forbes consulted with former company insiders, industry observers and Wall Street analysts. We used operating income for the film and consumer products units and estimated Marvel’s contribution at 22% — its share of the company’s total box office for the past decade. A 15x multiple was applied. Disney+ was included at the $200 billion valuation assigned by MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2021/09/04/from-avengers-to-shang-chi-what-marvel-studios-is-really-worth-to-walt-disney/,"From Avengers To Shang-Chi, What Marvel Studios Is Really Worth To Walt Disney"

"In 1950, choreographer Katherine Dunham found herself, not for the first time, walking the line between artist and entrepreneur. The debut of her ballet Southland in Santiago, Chile, commissioned by the country’s national symphony, had infuriated U.S. State Department officials. Amid the height of the Cold War, a dance depicting a brutal lynching in the antebellum South was not the kind of image-boosting arts experience that the U.S. was seeking to promote. Dunham had a stark choice: stop performing Southland on her South American tour or risk losing her business. For the founder of a wildly popular Black dance troupe that spent much of its time touring the world, the consequences were clear. Dunham supported some 13 dancers, five singers, three drummers and at least a half-dozen other staffers on the road. With the State Department’s ability to sponsor tours, rescind visas, and sway local news coverage, it could not be ignored.  Dunham pulled the two-act ballet from the tour’s repertoire, only to revive it again without success in Paris two years later. While Southland cost her subsequent government funding and was never recorded or performed at home, it cemented her legacy as a pioneer in bringing the Black experience and dance forms to a global audience.   Today, there are more than 100 Black-owned dance companies in the U.S.; in 1940, the Katherine Dunham Dance Company largely stood alone.  A dancer and anthropologist by training, Dunham’s troupe and school brought the dances of the African Diaspora into popular culture, providing opportunities to Black artists and training to future dance powerhouses like Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins and Arthur Mitchell. Marlon Brando and Earth Kitt were among the many who studied Dunham’s unique blend of African and Caribbean dance techniques. “She really set in motion a way to understand how dance matters, especially for Black people,” says Thomas DeFrantz, professor of dance and African American studies at Duke University. “And that sets a possibility for us now in the 21st century that we’re still enjoying.” Dunham was born in 1909 to a multiracial family in Jolliet, Illinois, just before racist policies and job opportunities would prompt a Great Migration of more than 500,000 Black people from the South. Her father was a tailor from Tennessee, descended from enslaved people from West Africa and Madagascar. Her French Canadian mother was a school principal whose Native American, African and English background meant she often passed for white.  Dunham’s entrepreneurial instincts started early. At 15, the fledgling dancer produced and starred in an evening cabaret to raise money for her family’s struggling church. She went on to study anthropology at the University of Chicago, where she became determined to challenge negative Black stereotypes rampant in modern dance by bolstering the rich dance traditions of the Diaspora. At 21, she co-founded the Ballet Nègre in Chicago, the country’s first Black ballet company and only the second in the U.S. overall.  Katherine Dunham Opens Show In Paris. Katherine Dunham opens with her troupe tonight at the Palais De Chaillot here Jan. 9th, with a whole new show featuring South and Central American dances. In 1935, the young dancer took a break to embark on a research trip to study various dance forms across the Caribbean. When she got to Haiti, she stayed for several months and focused her thesis work 0n its dance She would visit the country many times over her life and even bought a massive estate, Habitation Leclerc, that became a tourist attraction. Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, Dunham’s daughter, describes Haiti as “a revelation” for her mother. “It was the first Black Republic in the world and the Vodun was there,” she says, referencing the ""Vodun Ceremony,"" a religious dance practice. Dunham came back energized by what she learned in Haiti, and determined to break into the mainstream. She received critically-needed funding from the Federal Theatre Project, part of the Works Progress Administration, which allowed her to create her first full-length ballet, L'Ag'Ya, inspired by a traditional fighting dance in Martinique. At the Federal Theater she met costume and set designer John Pratt, who she would marry in 1941 and credit for the striking visuals of her shows. The company was offered a slot on Broadway on otherwise quiet Sunday nights in 1940, her dance reviews Tropics and Le Jazz ""Hot"" becoming sleeper hits. The very fact of her company’s existence and ascension was groundbreaking. Americans were used to seeing Black dancers in performance, but paying for tickets to a Black company owner was something new. “White folks were producing our works. We were performing, not owning, entertainment,” says Denise Saunders Thompson, CEO of The International Association of Blacks in Dance. “Her ability to have her own company during that time was outside of the norm.” Dunham appeared in films, including Pardon My Sarong and Stormy Weather. She began amassing some personal wealth, buying a mansion on the Upper East Side through the guise of her white secretary for $200,000 (the sellers reneged when they discovered she was the buyer). Admirers gave her jewelry she would later pawn to cover her company’s costs. Despite her glamorous lifestyle, she still had to manage the finances and logistics in addition to choreography. While Martha Graham had a Rothschild backer and accountants to handle the day-to-day drudgery, Dunham was tasked with maintaining the books.  “She was financially supporting dozens of dancers who, because of racism and segregation in the dance and theatrical worlds, didn't have many other job opportunities,” says Joanna Dee Das, professor of dance at Washington University in St. Louis and author of Katherine Dunham: Dance and the African Diaspora. “That itself is a political act.” It was at this time she made a life-changing impression on a teenage Alvin Ailey. “I couldn't believe that she put Black people on a legitimate stage,” he recalled later. “What she was doing was Afro-Caribbean. It was beauteous, it was spiritual. It touched something... in me.” American singer and actress Eartha Kitt (1927 - 2008, right) as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company, circa 1945. With her are other members of the dance troupe, Lawaune Ingram, Lucille Ellis and Richardena Jackson. (Photo by FPG/Archive Photos/Getty Images) In 1945, she opened a dance school in the heart of New York’s theater district. It was at the school she devised the Dunham Technique, a style of movement derived from African and Caribbean dances that is still considered foundational to modern dance today. Students were expected to take coursework in languages, history and anthropology, Dunham insisting that dancers needed to be well-rounded thinkers in order to be proper movers. The tuition paid by noted actors and other students enabled Dunham to fund scholarships for dancers of color who couldn’t afford to pay.  That generosity was a better artistic and humanitarian choice than a business choice. The school was constantly in dire financial straits, supported in part by the increasing success of Dunham’s tours. When they performed in places like Los Angeles and Portland, the company was a splash. When they were off, Dunham dissolved the group. That boom and bust accelerated as she took the company international, which raised the stakes (and the costs).  Eloise Anderson joined Dunham’s company during that dynamic time. She had come to Dunham’s school on scholarship after being discovered by a company member at another studio, after which Dunham plucked her out of the pack to go on tour. While the dancers were aware of Dunham’s many duties, they were mostly shielded from financial bumps in the road, she says, and never had their pay cut. After a performance in Sweden in 1950, Anderson recalls Dunham announcing a month-long hiatus before their next stop in Paris. She gave them a stipend to cover expenses in Monte Carlo. “We were never in a situation where we were dancers in a foreign country, unable to pay for a meal or find a place to sleep,” Anderson says. A new source of funding soon emerged when President Eisenhower established an emergency fund for American performers abroad, on the premise that good American art was bad PR for the Soviet Union. Congress made it permanent in 1956. Artists like Martha Graham, Louis Armstrong and Leonard Bernstein were sent all over the world on the government’s dime. For a number of reasons — racist attitudes towards her performances, mishandled applications and, most of all, Southland — Dunham was not selected. In 1954, her school shuttered. Her company continued to tour in Mexico, East Asia and Australia before heading back to Europe in 1959. After being hustled by a bad impresario, she and her dancers were stranded in Vienna without the funds to come home. She quickly cobbled together shows and television appearances to make up the difference. By 1960, the company dissolved. If Dunham’s story is not one of consistent success, it is certainly one of persistence. “What’s interesting about the story of her life as an entrepreneur, is how she just kept going. When something failed, she just moved on,” says DeFrantz. “She just kept investing and creating entrepreneurial bubbles. I think that's remarkable.” The end of her company was not the end of her role as a public figure, but her lifestyle did change. Dunham, who had hobnobbed with European royalty and Hollywood stars, became an artist-in-residence at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL. She would write memoirs and establish a school in East St. Louis. She was a constant advocate for Haiti, even after she had to sell her property there to a hotel developer. Ailey would go on to honor her legacy with a splashy collaboration with Dunham in 1987.  There are two nonprofit organizations today in East St. Louis that bear her name — The Katherine Dunham Center for Arts & Humanities, a museum that also hosts dance courses for the community, and The Institute for Dunham Technique Certification, which trains dance instructors using Dunham’s rigorous curriculum. Both carry on her legacy of giving anyone with aptitude the opportunity to participate, regardless of their means. Heather Himes Beal took dance classes at the museum for 18 years. There were times when her mother could not afford the $75 monthly tuition. “It was never a conversation about ‘Oh, you can't pay it?’” she says. “It was like, ‘okay, well, you don't have it.’ And there were plenty of people who never had it.” Now, Beal is a member of the Institute, where training for instructors across humanities disciplines can take up to seven years. Those who come out the other side are also expected to volunteer their time teaching, to make Dunham classes free for those who cannot pay. But even with Dunham’s fame, and improved funding infrastructure for arts organizations, it has been a struggle to keep both institutions afloat. Dunham died broke in 2006, leaving the museum without an endowment. And Beal suspects that her break with the State Department over Southland has affected their ability to get federal grants to this day. Both organizations reported less than $50,000 in contributions in 2019. President Ronald Reagan congratulates Katherine Dunham on her 1983 Kennedy Center Honors Award The financial situations of the two Dunham organizations are not unique. While much has changed since her time — dance companies now qualify as 501c3 nonprofits, there is a National Endowment of the Arts that has given more than $280 million to dance institutions since 1966 — the disparity between white and Black dance companies has not. Nonprofit arts organizations typically get 60% of their funding from program revenue, 24% from individual donors and the remainder from a combination of government grants and corporate sponsorships. That balance is rarely achievable for Black dance companies, which often struggle to get individual donors. Larger dance companies have sophisticated fundraising structures that make them more resilient to a bad box office year. In 2019, ABT raised $24.3 million in contributions and grants, almost as much as it earned in ticket sales, tuition and other revenue. Ailey, far and away the most successful Black dance company in America, raised $11.3 million, less than half of what it made in program revenue. Mid-sized and smaller Black dance companies have a much harder time, says Saunders Thompson: “Access to a nice, diversified portfolio for black dance companies has been challenging.”  That lack of endowment has made Black dance companies particularly vulnerable to Covid shutdowns. The government stepped in, if temporarily, providing $135 million to the NEA to distribute to companies and local agencies in need. Cleo Parker Robinson, a former pupil of Dunham’s, was worried what a lack of ticket sales during the pandemic would mean for her own company. Parker Robinson, who founded her eponymous company in Denver in 1970, had gotten access to funding over the years unavailable to Dunham: NEA grants, sponsorships from the likes of Coors and Philip Morris and donations from philanthropic giants like the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. But there still have been tough periods, Covid not the least of them. She credits her son, the company’s executive director, for seeing them out of the darkest days of the pandemic, but also the Dunham network of former proteges and admirers, for whom Dunham’s perseverance has always set the standard. “Everybody sees my name on the building,” says Parker Robinson. “They have no idea of the circles around me, that allowed me and encouraged me and challenged me to do the work when I felt like I couldn't do it any longer.” With additional reporting by Kira Grant.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2021/09/04/meet-the-entrepreneur-who-inspired-alvin-aley-angered-us-officials-and-transformed-modern-dance/,"Meet The Entrepreneur Who Inspired Alvin Ailey, Angered U.S. Officials And Transformed Modern Dance"
"Christian Pulisic is uniquely positioned to be the face of the U.S. men's national time for the next ... [+] five years, a period of time that will culminate in the 2026 World Cup hosted primarily on American soil. For all of Christian Pulisic’s heroics as a European soccer star with Star Spangled roots, his American soccer story — and the commercial potential that comes with it — is still closer to the start of its arc than the end. On the field, the 22-year-old Chelsea attacker could make his first World Cup qualifying appearance in nearly four years on Sunday. It would also be his first as the torchbearer for a young and exciting squad looking to restore honor to a humbled program after the failure of the last cycle. Off of it, he has the chance to inhabit air historically too rarefied for even the most prolific American men’s players. He’s already the first American to play in and win the UEFA Champions League final. And with the U.S. favored to reach the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and set to co-host the 2026 tournament, he could be the singular biggest star of the national team at a time when that means more in marketing clout than at any point in American history. “I think from a commercial point of view, I think it’s a great time for him to leave a little bit of a legacy,” says Matthew Moore, Pulisic’s commercial agent from the Centre Circle Consulting firm. “And I’m not talking about from a money point of view or anything like that, but just growing the game in the country. It’s going to be the single biggest thing that helps him get more kids to play soccer, which is the only thing he wants.” Moore has worked with Pulisic since his teenage days at Borussia Dortmund, which has given the pair some experience already understanding how to manage exponentially growing notoriety. While Pulisic certainly gained acclaim in the Bundesliga, his $73-million move to Chelsea and the Premier League in January of 2019 seasons came with a different kind of reach. Moore points to Pulisic’s Instagram following, broken down by country. After Americans and Brittons, his next-largest cohorts of followers are from India, Brazil and Nigeria. “He only resonates in those countries because he took the step into the Premier League,” Moore says. “If you can have a guy who resonates in the US, the UK, Germany and India, you’ve hit gold. Those are some of the biggest consumer markets in the world.” Pulisic had also noticed a change in the amount of recognition he got from Americans since moving to the Premiership, the nation’s most-watched European League. Only Mexico’s Liga MX draws more viewers in the U.S.  “I think I expected it in a way,” Pulisic said of the increased visibility. “I knew I always wanted to play in the Premier League. And it was the league I knew the most about growing up.” Through it all, Moore says the strategy has been to build stable partnerships with genuine personal roots, with an aim more toward enhancing the state of soccer in American than simply his personal finances. Even as a teenager, Moore says that was Pulisic’s idea, though it wasn’t clear his star would grow quite so bright so quick. “It comes from playing in Europe and being an American, and just wanting to inspire kids especially and really anyone back home,” Pulisic said. “It’s one of the biggest reasons why I play this game, and it will always be really important to me. And any chance that I can get to do that is just amazing to me.” It sounds like a PR spin, and maybe some of it is. But it’s also legitimately reflected in what Pulisic and Moore have cultivated so far. Pulisic’s relationship with Chipotle emanated from his personal affection for the American fast casual restaurant chain. Moore recalled that, when he would visit Pulisic at Dortmund, the pair would drive the 140 miles to Frankfurt to eat at the chain’s only German location.  His work with The Hershey Company is self explanatory — the famed chocolate and snack magnate is headquartered in Pulisic’s Pennsylvania hometown of the same name. And his longstanding partnership with sports memorabilia and trading card company Panini America stems from his childhood passion for collecting. “I just had binders of sports cards, basically, of all sports. I would go up and down the streets to all the yard sales, looking for just any card,” Pulisic recalls. “I had this Steve Nash card that was one of my favorites.” A Christian Pulisic U.S. men's national team trading card from Panini. Panini, which also is exclusive partners with the Premier League and FIFA, was the first company (outside of equipment suppliers) to partner with Pulisic. And earlier this week the pair reached an extension that runs through the 2026 World Cup. Both Hershey and Panini have helped Pulisic run soccer clinics during returns to Central Pennsylvania. In total, Pulisic’s portfolio includes seven partners, with room for maybe one or two more at maximum, Moore says.  That may be bad news for corporations who are just beginning to sense the potential windfall of the buildup 2026. It may be good news for Pulisic. While he has learned to wield his corporate appeal to advance his interest and potential legacy, it’s still not something that necessarily comes naturally. “Obviously, that’s not the focus when you’re a younger kid trying to make it in Europe,” he says. “When I first started to be more well known (in Germany) … it starts to hit you.” And he’s definitely not thinking in terms of five-year marketing plans. Not when booking a trip to Qatar next November is still such an uncertainty. “A World Cup in our own country, it sounds incredible, obviously,” he says. “But what we need to focus on is this World Cup coming up. That’s all the focus is on right now.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianquillen/2021/09/04/how-christian-pulisic-tackles-unique-usmnt-stardom-while-eyeing-2022---and-2026/,"How Christian Pulisic Handles Unique Marketing Power Of USMNT, Premier League Stardom"
"Many years ago, I declared war on passwords or at least engaged in an ongoing information campaign against poor password hygiene. This comes as no surprise to anyone who regularly reads my articles, of course. However, what surprised me was discovering that I finally have an ally in the U.S. Government, which has suddenly taken dangerous password practices very seriously indeed. It's been a long time in coming. Still, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is under Department of Homeland Security oversight, has warned businesses that relying upon passwords alone can be ""exceptionally risky"" and advised this should be ""avoided by all organizations."" CISA adds single-factor authentication to the security bad practice list On August 30, CISA added the use of single-factor authentication to the official bad practices list. Using such authentication alone, a username and password, in other words, is bad for all businesses, CISA says, but particularly so for those systems that support critical infrastructure operations. The agency warns that doing so ""is dangerous and significantly elevates risk to national security, national economic security, and national public health and safety."" What is even more surprising is that it's taken until now for such a dangerous security practice to get added to that list is, and I hope you are sitting down; it only joins two other entries. Look, I appreciate that CISA admits the naughty step list ""does not include every possible inadvisable cybersecurity practice,"" but just three entries? The other two, for your information, are not to use end-of-life or unsupported software and the avoidance of known, fixed or default passwords. All three entries are stated to be ""especially egregious"" if done so with tech that's internet accessible.  What is good practice, no matter what kind of organization you are, and applies equally to individuals, is to multi-factor authenticate all the things. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is, as the name suggests, the use of a mixture of different authentication methodologies from different categories. It used to be the case that there were three generally accepted factor categories: knowledge (what you know), possession (what you have) and inherence (what you are). But two additional factors can now be added in the shape of location (where you are) and behavior (what you do).  Let's take two-factor authentication (2FA) as an example, as most people probably best understand this. This is usually applied using the knowledge factor through a username and password, supplemented with a secondary possession factor such as a hardware key, smartcard or one-time code delivered by an app. The latter is interesting because this can also offer a third factor for valid multi-factor authentication in a 'buy one get one free' way. If the app that delivers the one-time code needed to authenticate the user login is on a smartphone, specifically a smartphone requiring facial or fingerprint recognition to access the app itself, then inherence is also present. What difference can multi-factoring all the things make, you may well be wondering? CISA cites research from Google that suggests quite a lot, actually. That research showed that just by adding another authentication factor, in this case, a recovery phone number to a Google Account, a staggering number of attacks could be blocked. Google said up to 100% of automated bot attacks were prevented, 99% of bulk phishing attacks and even 66% of 'targeted attacks' against account holders. I reached out to someone who knows a fair bit about the role of passwords and authentication management when it comes to good security practice, Adam Caudill. With 20 years of experience in security and research, focusing on application security and secure communications, Caudill is currently the director of security at 1Password. As you would expect, he agrees that using MFA everywhere it's supported is one of the most accessible and impactful security investments you can make. ""It's low friction for you,"" he says, ""and makes the job of an attacker much harder."" Indeed, of all the end-user security improvements he has seen, Caudill told me, ""MFA has the best return on a remarkably low investment, both in terms of time and money."" So, does this mean that password managers such as 1Password are, well, passe? ""On the contrary,"" Caudill insists, multi-factor authentication ""shows the value of full-featured password managers, as they make it simple to use MFA and sync between devices, so it's easy to log in from any device.""  I agree, and there's also a point to be made that, as authentication becomes arguably more complex, then password managers have an even more significant productivity impact. ""It's important to understand that a password manager has more than one role in a user's life,"" Caudill concludes, ""it not only keeps them safer, but it helps them be more productive and avoid downtime.""

"Beyoncé Knowles has a thing for the number four. Beyhive, rejoice. Beyoncé Knowles—the Grammy award-winning singer, actress, fashionista, wife of billionaire rapper Jay-Z and overall cultural icon—hits the big 4-0 today, September 4, 2021. It’s a significant date by all means, and made all the more so by her fixation on the number four. The number most recently appeared in the Internet-shattering Tiffany & Co. ad campaign featuring the famous couple (and a previously unseen Jean-Michel Basquiat painting) with Knowles sporting the luxury jeweler’s famed Tiffany Yellow Diamond, making her the fourth woman in history to wear the piece. References to the numeral are scattered throughout her life and music. Here’s where it’s popped up: Knowles shares her birth date—Sept. 4—with Jay-Z, who was born on Dec. 4 in 1970, 11 years before his future wife. Knowles’ mother, Tina Lawson, was born Jan. 4, 1954. Knowles and mother Tina Lawson at the 2009 Annual BET Awards in Los Angeles.  In a dash of mysterious coincidence: Forbes estimated Knowles’ fortune at $440 million for our 2021 Self-Made Women list.  Instead of wedding rings, Knowles and Jay-Z sport tattoos of the roman numeral four (“IV”) on their ring fingers. The two were married on the numerically significant April 4, 2008. Knowles and husband Jay-Z kiss during a 2014 performance in Paris, France.  Speaking of roman numerals, nine-year-old daughter Blue Ivy’s middle name is a direct reference to IV. Coincidentally, Knowles’ twins, Rumi and Sir, turned four this year. Knowles, Jay-Z and daughter Blue Ivy attend the 2018 Grammy Awards in New York City.  Knowles’ 2011 fourth studio album was obviously titled 4. (It debuted that week in the top spot on the Billboard 200, making it her fourth number one album.) And her fifth album, the eponymously-named Beyoncé, was released Dec. 13, 2013.

"Tesla’s new 4680 battery format promises yet another step forward in electric vehicle capabilities, but it isn’t ready for largescale production just yet. Also, while it promises more range for less cost, Tesla’s new cell design still doesn’t fix one of the major criticisms of battery-electric vehicles – how long they take to “refuel”. Israeli company StoreDot thinks it has the answer and has developed a prototype 4680 cell to prove it. Charging to 100% takes just 10 minutes. StoreDot's prototype 4680 cells can charge to 100% capacity in just 10 minutes. There are a lot of companies chasing different aspects of the battery business, which is understandable considering how fast this market is already growing and how it is likely to expand exponentially over the next decade. StoreDot has chosen to focus on the problem of range anxiety, which largely revolves around this issue of how long it can take to recharge an electric vehicle’s batteries. There are numerous articles by lovers of internal combustion engines comparing the five-minute refueling of their favored type of vehicle to the much longer time required to replenish current battery-electric cars. This has improved over the years, but even with the fastest 250kW or 350kW chargers and the most optimized vehicles, such as the Tesla Model 3 and Porsche Taycan, it can take 30 minutes or more to recharge to 80% capacity – and much longer to reach 100%. This also has implications for battery health. Repeated rapid DC charging, particularly all the way to 100% capacity, can have detrimental effects on the longevity of a lithium-ion battery. The key to this problem is partly in the design of the battery chemistry, and in particular the anodes. Conventional lithium-ion batteries use graphite-dominant anodes, which have been one of the enabling technologies for current energy densities. But they can impose limits on charge speeds as well as the lifecycle of the battery. One solution to these problems is to switch the anode to silicon-dominant material. This allows the battery to take on energy much more rapidly without damaging the cells. Increasing battery energy densities could mean we will have a Tesla Model 3 with over 600 miles of ... [+] range in a few years. In association with its manufacturing partner EVE Energy in China and Warwick University in the UK, StoreDot has created these prototype cells with silicon-dominant chemistry in the 4680 format that can be charged to 100% in just 10 minutes. This would make “refueling” a battery-electric vehicle take around the same time as an internal combustion one and solve one of the issues that currently makes some people think hydrogen might be a better solution (despite its many other drawbacks). Imagine arriving at a recharging spot in your Tesla Model S Plaid and driving away 10 minutes later with 390 miles of range available again. There would be no impediment at all to driving extremely long distances. Silicon-dominant battery chemistry will also allegedly allow greater battery energy density, according to StoreDot. Tesla’s current 2170 cells in the form of the Panasonic 6752 units supplied in US-manufactured Tesla Model 3 cars have an energy density of 260 Wh/kg. StoreDot claims its silicon-dominant battery chemistry will enable 400-450 Wh/kg, which could mean an almost doubling of range for the same weight. In other words, a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus could have a range of 480 miles instead of the current 278 miles, and the Long Range version might last for well over 600 miles, further than many internal combustion cars on a full tank of fuel. However, just having battery chemistry that is capable of faster charging doesn’t automatically make it possible. StoreDot also recently filed a patent for fast charging optimization, which it hopes will help alleviate the charging time problem even without the new battery chemistry. This is designed to work with existing graphite battery technology as well as silicon-dominant, requiring a small piece of hardware either in the charger and/or the car plus software in the car’s battery management system. This “booster” technology, originally called FlashBattery and now branded XFC, is being made available to all manufacturers and a number are already working with StoreDot to implement it, including Daimler. StoreDot's patent for ""booster"" technology could cut charging times for existing lithium-ion ... [+] batteries by up to 50%. This will allow cars to make better use of the 350kW chargers that are starting to arrive, such as IONITY’s network in Europe. Of course, charging a 100kWh battery in 10 minutes would require more than that – 600kW – which doesn’t currently exist on any public charging network. So there will be other infrastructure-based changes that will need to be made to achieve StoreDot’s extreme fast-charging ability. But XFC can help optimize what we already have, potentially reducing charging times with existing battery chemistries by 50%. That’s just the beginning, though. StoreDot’s demonstration of a 4680-format battery capable of charging in 10 minutes shows what the future could hold for electric vehicles, and soon.

"Philippine Airlines planes are parked at the international airport in Manila in September 2016. / ... [+] AFP / TED ALJIBE (Photo credit should read TED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images) Philippine Airlines—controlled by billionaire Lucio Tan—made its much-anticipated bankruptcy filing in the U.S., paving the way for the restructuring of the flag carrier amid mounting losses arising from pandemic-induced global travel restrictions. “The restructuring plan, which is subject to court approval, provides over $2 billion in permanent balance sheet reductions from existing creditors and allows the airline to consensually contract fleet capacity by 25%,” the company said in a statement on Saturday after filing for a pre-arranged restructuring plan under the U.S. Chapter 11 process in the Southern District of New York. Under the plan, PAL will raise $505 million in long-term equity and debt financing from its majority shareholder and an additional $150 million debts from new investors.  The airline—which also aims to complete a parallel filing in the Philippines under the Financial Insolvency and Rehabilitation Act of 2010—said it is committed to maintain business continuity throughout the restructuring process, while meeting its financial obligations to employees, customers, the Philippine government, its lessors and creditors. “We are grateful to our lenders, aviation partners and other creditors for supporting the plan, which empowers PAL to overcome the unprecedented impact of the global pandemic that has significantly disrupted businesses in all sectors, especially aviation, and emerge stronger for the long-term,” Tan, 87, PAL’s chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

[+] celebrations and the airline's rollout of the Airbus A350 and A321neo passenger planes in Manila on July 17, 2018. The bankruptcy filing comes as PAL started downsizing its fleet, with the return of two aircrafts in July to lessors and the delay in the delivery of new planes that were originally scheduled last year and this year to between 2026 and 2030. Downsizing is crucial for the airline’s cost-cutting initiatives as the company said this month that continuing losses has significantly strained the company’s liquidity position. Airlines are among the hardest hit by the pandemic as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and restricted cross-border travel to curb the spread of the virus. The International Air Transport Association estimates that airlines around the world will lose about $48 billion this year after incurring about $126 billion in losses last year. PAL, which reported a record net loss of 73 billion pesos in 2020, continued to bleed this year, incurring a further net loss of 16.6 billion pesos in the first half ended June 30.  The airline currently operates just 21% of pre-pandemic flights, PAL president Gilbert Santa Maria said in a video message posted on its website. Air travel volume tumbled from about 30 million passengers in 2019 to 7 million last year due to pandemic restrictions, he added. Tan—who emerged as PAL’s controlling shareholder in 1995 when he was appointed chairman—regained control of PAL in in 2014 after buying San Miguel Corp.’s controlling interest in the airline. With a net worth of $3.3 billion, Tan, was ranked the third-richest individual in the Philippines when the World’s Billionaires List was published in April.

"JD.com is diversifying. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ... [+] Images) Chinese e-commerce giant, JD.com is expanding in the travel-retail channel by taking a shareholding in the North Asia business of Paris-based global duty-free operator Lagardère Travel Retail, part of France’s Lagardère Group.  JD.com and state-owned fund China Jianyin Investment (JIC) are jointly injecting $112 million to take respective shares of 18.6% and 3.7% in the North Asia division. It generated revenue of $176 million in 2020 from travel shopping and duty-free activities in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Japan. Subject to customary procedures, the deal is expected to close later this month. The tie-up does not come as a surprise. Last fall, JD.com’s rival Alibaba Group took a stake in the world’s biggest airport retailer Dufry, with plans to jointly target the travel-retail business in China which is booming. Now it’s JD’s turn to jump in.  Eudes Fabre: “The expertise of our partners will help position us for the next phase of growth in ... [+] the region."" According to Lagardère, the partnership will enable it to accelerate growth in China and evolve its business model by honing omnichannel skills, an area in which JD.com excels. The e-commerce player also has strong expertise in smart supply chain, logistics and analytics/consumer insights.  This is exemplified by the company’s 618 Grand Promotion in June. During the event, the 236 brands taking part each achieved sales orders averaging $15 million, and at least 84% of those were fulfilled on the same or next day across China. Luxury players involved included brands from LVMH Group, L’Oreal’s Kiehl’s, and Estée Lauder Companies

  brands which have seen strong travel-retail demand in the Chinese offshore duty-free market.  Benefits of the deal for JD.com include Lagardère’s presence in 32 airports and 28 high-speed railway stations in North Asia through a network of 480 stores selling a wide range of categories including luxury, duty-free, specialty retail and food and beverages. JD.com vice president Simon Han, who supervises the global import platform JD Worldwide, expects the new partnership to leverage each company’s respective strengths and “allows us to explore more opportunities in the travel-retail sector.” Developing omnichannel duty-free and duty-paid shopping services at travel locations is one of their joint goals. During the pandemic, China has become a lifeline for the ravaged duty-free business, so much so that in Lagardère’s case, the country’s share of company revenue soared from 2% in 2019 to 7% last year. Lagardère Travel Retail is looking to further maximize China’s solid performance to make up for weaknesses still being seen in the rest of the global duty-free market.

Lagardère North Asia is run by CEO Eudes Fabre and he said in a statement: “The expertise of our partners will help position us for the next phase of growth in the region. Domestic consumption in China and the digitalization of the travel experience are powerful and positive trends for the years to come.” JD.com has an enviable base of more than 500 million customers, so it knows a thing or two about domestic demand drivers. In the second quarter, thanks to its successful 618 event, the company added another 32 million new users, and according to the company’s chief financial officer Sandy Xu, that was the largest single-quarter increase of new users in the company’s history.  On August 23, Xu also said in an interim results statement: “We are encouraged by the continued diversification of our revenue streams, reflecting our open ecosystem strategy of empowering customers and business partners through JD.com’s supply chain-based technology and infrastructure.”  One of the benefits of that infrastructure is speedy delivery to almost all of China’s population, a strength that Lagardère Travel Retail will likely want to tap into for its domestic duty-paid travel retail business.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinrozario/2021/09/03/jdcom-takes-equity-stake-in-global-duty-free-retailer-lagardre/,JD.com Takes Equity Stake In Global Duty-Free Retailer Lagardère
"CM Punk will do commentary during Darby Allin's match against Daniel Garcia.  AEW Rampage advertised Darby Allin vs. Daniel Garcia with CM Punk on commentary, Rebel and Jamie Hayter vs. Kris Statlander, an appearance by TNT champion Miro and Malakai Black vs. Lee Johnson.  Last week’s broadcast of AEW Rampage garnered 722,000 viewers after drawing over a million viewers the week prior for CM Punk’s return.        AEW didn’t bother to further the Lee Johnson character as he was a pig to slaughter against Malakai Black.  Given how quickly I thought this match would end, I made sure not to miss the picture-in-picture. This crowd is still very much into Malakai Black despite (and possibly because of) his monster heel booking.  Dustin Rhodes cut yet another great promo on Malakai Black ahead of his slaughtering this coming Wednesday.  I love the storyline that Eddie Kingston’s biggest moves are designed to injure the neck, which is Miro’s weakness.  Eddie Kingston refuses to stop repping DMX on AEW television and I love to see it.  Eddie Kingston and Miro have, in short order, made me more interested in this feud than most of All Out.  In a display of alien strength (see above), Kris Statlander caught Jamie Hayter and held her while Rebel was sitting on her shoulders.  I love the idea that Statlander has such unique offense, she had to have learned it while on the Andromeda Galaxy.  Kris Statlander seems to be building support as a babyface and I wouldn’t be surprised if the reaction was split, if not skewed toward Statlander.  Some fan hilariously tried to offer CM Punk a drink after Punk did another crowd dive.  Chris Jericho asked CM Punk why he didn’t bring a sportscoat to the commentary table, and Punk responded by saying “that’s the old me.”  Days before he biggest match of his career, of course Darby Allin took a wild bump over the ring announcer’s table.  Chris Jericho and CM Punk had some great back-and-forths on commentary to get over Punk’s mindset headed into his first match back.

"Naomi Osaka, of Japan, reacts during a match against Leylah Fernandez, of Canada, at the third round ... [+] of the US Open tennis championships, Friday, Sept. 3, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Naomi Osaka won’t be defending her U.S. Open title, and it’s unclear when she will next appear on a tennis court. After failing to close out the match on her serve in the second set, the four-time major champion and No. 3 seed smacked her racquet on the ground during the second-set tiebreaker, then threw it several feet and ultimately went on to lose to 18-year-old Canadian left-hander Leylah Fernandez, 5-7, 7-6. 6-4, in the third round. Following the loss, Osaka, who has battled mental health issues this year, said she planned to take a break from tennis. “This is very hard to articulate,” she said as she teared up. “Basically I feel like I'm kind of at this point where I'm trying to figure out what I want to do, and I honestly don't know when I'm going to play my next tennis match. Sorry.” She added: “I think I'm going to take a break from playing for a while.” Osaka had been the second favorite behind No. 1 seed Ash Barty to win the title in New York. The loss snapped a 16-match winning streak at Grand Slams. She lost three matches this summer — all to left-handers. After winning the Australian Open and starting the season 12-0, she went 5-4. Osaka, who has admitted to battling mental health issues that caused her to withdraw from the French Open and then skip Wimbledon, served for the match in the first set but then lost control of her emotions. She became unglued in the second-set tiebreak. She smacked her racquet to the ground after losing one point, and threw it several feet forward after losing another but did not receive a warning from umpire Alison Hughes.  “Yeah, I'm really sorry about that,” Osaka said after the match. “I'm not really sure why...I was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point. “Like normally I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don't go my way, and I feel like you can feel that. I'm not really sure why it happens the way it happens now.” After losing the tiebreak, Osaka left the court without telling Hughes, but then apologized upon her return. “She definitely lost her composure,” 18-time Grand Slam champion Chrissie Evert said on ESPN. “She is usually one to internalize her emotions and feelings on the court. She lost control. She banged her racket. She threw her racket and yet the umpire did not give her a warning.” Added Mary Joe Fernandez: “She’s lucky she didn’t get a warning.” Osaka was then broken in the first game of the third set when she smacked a two-handed backhand into the net on break point. “Honestly, I wasn’t focusing on Naomi, I was only focusing on myself and what I needed to do,” Leylah Fernandez said. By the third set, the crowd was openly supporting the upset bid, and voiced its displeasure when Osaka took a long time before one of Fernandez’s service points. “It made a huge difference,” Fernandez said of the crowd support. “Thanks to New York, to the New York fans over here. They helped me get a win.” Serving for the match at 5-4, Fernandez won the game at love despite facing the biggest moment of her career. She raised her hands in celebration when Osaka hit a forehand wide on match point. The loss ended the Grand Slam season for Osaka, who has had a difficult season. She refused to speak with the media at the French Open and drew a $15,000 fine as a result. She then withdrew from the tournament and opted to skip Wimbledon. She was upset in the third round at the Tokyo Olympics in her native Japan, citing pressure as a factor. After losing in her second match in Cincinnati, Osaka was rusty from lack of match play entering the Open. She had only played one match in New York entering Friday because she advanced to the third round via a walkover. “I mean, I think I would have preferred to play a match,” Osaka said. “I've never had a walkover in a Grand Slam, so that was definitely a really weird feeling.” Fernandez, meantime, will keep going forward after the biggest win of her career. She had lost in the second round at the French Open and the first round at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Born to an Ecuadorian father and a Filipino Canadian mother, Fernandez currently trains in Florida. She is ranked 73rd in the world. She had earned about $374,000 in total in 2021 entering the U.S. Open and will now take home at least $265,000 for reaching the fourth round. “From the very beginning, right before the match, I knew I was able to win,” she said.  It will be Fernandez — not Osaka — who advances to the fourth round against three-time major champion Angelique Kerber, who earlier beat 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in three sets. “It will be a battle,” Fernandez said. “We’re just going to have a fun. I’m just going to put on a show like I did tonight and we’ll see how it goes.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/03/defending-champion-naomi-osaka-loses-in-third-round-at-us-open-after-tossing-racquet-in-frustration/,"Naomi Osaka Loses In U.S. Open Third Round After Tossing Racket, Says She Will ‘Take A Break’ From Tennis"
"Roman Reigns vs. Finn Balor for the Universal Championship. WWE Friday Night SmackDown advertised Finn Balor vs. Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship, Cesaro vs. Seth Rollins and The Usos vs. The Street Profits in a Championship Contender’s Match.  Last week’s broadcast of Friday Night SmackDown stayed hot with 2.250 million viewers for the return of Becky Lynch.        Montez Ford might have had the scariest bump of 2021 as he landed right on his face during a tope to the outside.  Given how great their previous match was, it was very disappointing to see this match end so suddenly via non-finish.  Becky Lynch baited this crowd into chanting “you deserve it,” which tells me her days as a babyface are done.  This new Becky Lynch is shredded enough to be a an unlikable villain rather than the everywoman she portrayed as Becky Balboa.  Bianca Belair had an awesome rebuttal to Becky Lynch’s similarly awesome slow-burning heel promo. As much doubt as there is for Becky Lynch heel turn, WWE might be on to something.  Call me crazy, but it feels like Rick Boogs is on the precipice of a mega-push. It’s as if Vince McMahon just found out Shinsuke Nakamura’s shredded guitar player is also a wrestler. Toni Storm looks like she’ll be inserted in this feud as a love interest of Rick Boogs. The Boogs train is operating at lightspeed.  Before this match even began I felt like the finish was going to be Seth Rollins winning via Spear. That did not happen, so perhaps they’re saving that finish for Rollins’ rematch against Edge.  As expected, Seth Rollins is now emulating Edge following last week’s promo. For now, this is limited to Edge’s moveset.  Cesaro swung Seth Rollins 20 times, a la WrestleMania 37, but unfortunately these fans either lost count or got tired of counting.  Edge saved Cesaro from a con-chair-to, but knowing he was in the building this whole time, where was he in the several minutes Cesaro was being assaulted by Rollins? WWE came to its senses and booked Logan Paul as the heel he was born to play.  If Happy Corbin had Logan Paul as his full-time manager, Corbin would be world champion.  Naomi was once again shunned by Sonya Deville, leading to Sonya Deville saying “anyway, Karen...” if I didn’t know any better, I’d say WWE was doing a racially charged angle where a black talent is less of a priority. Sounds like a company I know. Roman Reigns received yet another notch on his O.P. belt when he kicked out of the coup de grace.  Every time Finn Balor is about to receive a world title match, he is sabotaged and management just turns a blind eye to it. I won’t blame him one bit when he turns heel.  Finn Balor was attacked before this match and was protected even more by fading into submission rather than tapping.

The Nets officially announced Friday evening that Aldridge, 36, had re-signed with the team after briefly retiring in April due to an irregular heartbeat. ESPN reported the deal is for one year at $2.6 million. ""I retired in April based on what I believed was the wisest precautionary decision for my personal health at the time, but further testing and evaluation by several top physicians has convinced the doctors, myself and the Nets that I'm fully cleared and able to return to the rigors of the NBA,"" Aldridge, a seven-time NBA All-Star, told ESPN in a statement. ""I loved my brief time with Brooklyn and am excited to rejoin the team in pursuit of a championship."" Aldridge will join a veteran frontcourt in Brooklyn that also features Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin and Paul Millsap, along with Nic Claxton and rookie Day’Ron Sharpe. Aldridge signed with the Nets in March after getting a buyout from the San Antonio Spurs. He has averaged 19.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game in his career. “We’re excited to have [Aldridge],” Nets coach Steve Nash said when the team first obtained him in March. “He’s a skilled big who can shoot it, score around the basket, is an experienced vet. He brings a nice skillset to our team, he adds size and has shooting range so we’re excited to all the things he brings and look forward to incorporating him as soon as possible.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 30: DeAndre Jordan #6 of the Brooklyn Nets reacts during the second ...

The Nets have dealt away a slew of draft picks to build what they believe is a championship contender led by Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Jordan initially signed with the Nets in 2019 along with Durant and Irving, but fell out of Nash’s rotation last season as the team reached the Eastern Conference semifinals before falling to the Milwaukee Bucks. He returns to Los Angeles, where he spent 10 years with the Clippers, and joins a veteran Lakers team that also has Dwight Howard and Marc Gasol at the center position. “We appreciate everything DeAndre has contributed to our organization over the past two seasons both on and off the court and wish him and his family the best moving forward,” said Nets General Manager Sean Marks.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/03/lamarcus-aldridge-re-signs-with-brooklyn-nets-deandre-jordan-to-land-with-los-angeles-lakers/,LaMarcus Aldridge Re-Signs With Brooklyn Nets; DeAndre Jordan To Land With Los Angeles Lakers
"Guy Pearce poses for a portrait in New York.  Guy Pearce loves a challenge, so the idea of headlining an R-rated sci-fi thriller that involves turning parking lots and industrial buildings in Belfast, Northern Ireland, into a convincing futuristic dystopia ticked that box. Pearce plays a private investigator hired by a wealthy and eccentric businessman to find his missing daughter, believed to be in the sordid world of the titular Zone 414. I caught up with the actor to discuss the movie, his interest in a Lockdown sequel, and the Emmy-nominated Mare of Easttown. Simon Thompson: Zone 414 is a genre movie, and I could feel many of the influences. Instead of me telling you what I thought they were, can you tell me what the ones you took with you into this were?  Guy Pearce: I probably didn’t have any, to be honest. For me, I am purely looking from the inside of the character out. When I sign up for a film and start to talk to the director, when I begin to see what the art department is doing and see the props and the sets, I get a sense of what the world will be like. Andrew Baird, the director, didn’t sit me down and say, ‘Okay, so Blade Runner is what we’re going for here.’ I would rather not know any of that stuff. Once I feel like we’re plagiarizing or borrowing from stuff, it’s not helpful. I love the feeling of reading a script and just being entirely taken by whatever the emotional trajectory might be, or the journey that a character is on, or the outlook that they have that I haven’t played or experienced before. Thompson: When you watch the finished film, did you get Blade Runner vibes? I felt like there was a bit of Dirty Harry in there too. Pearce: I’m much more interested when I’m watching it back and thinking, ‘Did that scene work? Did that line work? Has that come across the way I wanted it to?’ I’m much more analytical about what we are doing than over references to, or influences of, other stuff. Maybe to my detriment, I remember when I did Lockout, and the general criticism was that it was a total rip-off of Escape from New York. When people said that, I was like, ‘Wow, I don’t even know if I saw Escape from New York.’ More fool me for not having picked up on that. I looked at that as a really fun role. What the character had to go through was exciting and was a great change for me. Outsiders just looked at it and went, ‘Wait a minute.’ I’m also quite taken by music in films and what that does. I saw a rough cut of Zone 414 about six or eight months ago, and I was getting a sense of how it was working, the pace, whether the scenes between each of us were working, and there was temporary music in there. When I saw the finished film, I was really moved by it because the icy and strange, sterile nature, which is wonderful, was underpinned by the music. There’s a really emotional undercurrent. The film is about emotions, latching onto or repressing them, and how we handle them. I was really pleased with that. I’m thinking more about that, and I am going, ‘Oh yeah, Blade Runner.’ (Laughs) Thompson: Few things say strange and stark more than parking lots in Belfast on a night shoot. Pearce: (Laughs) In December, too. It’s funny because, especially in this day and age, you rely a lot on post-production. On set, they’ll say, ‘This is the doorway. You’re driving in here. That’s Belfast in the background or an empty space, but we’re going to paint in an entire city,’ and all you can do is say, ‘Well, okay.’ Of course, I watch the finished movie and go, ‘Oh, s**t! It worked. Fantastic.’ It’s always amazing to film in real locations, in actual buildings. If you’re doing a period piece and filming in stately homes in the UK, there are the grounds, the rolling hills, and the beautiful 14th-century turrets. No question, it’s easier. It’s perhaps not easier, but it’s just not something you have to think about on set. A lot of it comes down to budgets and what people can afford.  Thompson: That must happen a lot these days. Pearce: Funnily enough, I’ve just done two films, one called The Infernal Machine, which is set in Southern California, on the border of Mexico, and the film I did before that was with Liam Neeson was called Memory and set on the Mexican border, but in El Paso, Texas. So I’ve just done these two films set on the Mexican border, but Memory was filmed in Bulgaria, and The Infernal Machine was filmed in Portugal. With both of those jobs, you’re going, ‘Okay, so how’s that going to work? What are they going to do to make this look like we’re really where we’re supposed to be?’ Day by day, you see what the art department has done, you see they’re avoiding shooting certain things, and they’re going to paint something out. You watch the finished product and go, ‘Yeah, it works.’ The giveaway with stuff like that is when audiences watch the credits, and as they roll up, they thank Bulgaria and the Bulgarian crew, and people realize, ‘Aha! So they didn’t shoot it on the Mexican border at all.’ Thompson: You mentioned Lockout earlier. It’s one of your movies that I love, and it’s about to celebrate its tenth anniversary. Have you ever thought of revisiting that character, Snow, and doing a TV show or as a sequel? Has that ever been discussed? Pearce: Because I love that movie. I’ve never discussed that with anyone, but people who liked Lockout have brought it up with me. They’ve often said, ‘Oh, man, I love that character. You know, you should do more of that stuff.’ I’ve done some things where I played the character a couple of times, but generally, everything I do is something I do just once. I think there’s something about him that people love just because he’s laconic, he’s a tough guy, he’s got that kooky sense of humor. People have quite liked him over the years. I’d be curious about it, absolutely. I’d have to get really fit again, though. I was super fit during that film. It was a lot easier to jump off buildings and punch the hell out of people in my early 40s than it is in my early 50s.

[+] Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie and Pearce wins Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie during the 63rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, California. Thompson: This year, Mare of Easttown got a lot of attention from audiences and secured 16 Emmy nominations. I am not going to lie, but as soon as your character, Richard, turned up, I thought he was the killer. Was that your assumption from the get-go? Pearce: (Laughs) I didn’t think that, but that is only because Kate Winslet told me that I wasn’t when she first called me about it. They did have another actor for the role at first. They’d been filming for a while, and a few things went wrong, so they stopped, and then they reignited things and brought me in. Basically, Kate rang me and said, ‘You have to come and do this job.’ But you are right because every friend of mine who watched it said, ‘Well, clearly you’re the killer. I mean, there’s no question. Why else would you be there? Obviously, your character did it.’ (Laughs) It was interesting to have everybody have that reaction. For me, it was just about getting to work with Kate again, plus it was a great script. I loved it. I’m just slightly beyond a cameo, but it was an interesting shoot for me. They’d been filming since November of 2019. My first day was March 12, 2020, and then we shut down that night because of COVID, and we didn’t go back until September or October to carry on with what I had to shoot. I only did seven days of filming in total, so it was a pretty brief job for me, but it was spread out over six months.

"Rideshare companies Lyft and Uber both separately announced they will cover legal fees for any drivers who are sued under Texas’ new abortion law for transporting women to abortion clinics, following a wave of other companies that have declared they would provide aid to women seeking abortions in the state.

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Under Texas’ new abortion law, anyone who helps an individual with an abortion, including driving them to a clinic, can be sued and fined over $10,000, which raised concerns for some rideshare drivers, according to NPR. Lyft said it has created a “Driver Defense Fund” to cover 100% of legal fees for any driver sued under the abortion law while driving on its platform. On Twitter, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company would “cover legal fees in the same way” as Lyft, and noted that “drivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go.” Lyft said it will also be donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to ensure “transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.” ""Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride,"" Lyft said in a statement. “Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable.” Texas’ new restrictive abortion law was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in May and went into effect on Wednesday, and the  Supreme Court voted 5-4, allowing the abortion law to take effect. The law bans abortion after signs of a fetal heartbeat are detected, which can be picked up by an ultrasound about six weeks from conception. Under the law, private citizens have the power to enforce the abortion ban by bringing forth lawsuits to anyone who may be “aiding and abetting” an abortion. The announcements by Uber and Lyft come just one day after popular dating apps Match and Bumble said they would start funds to help Texans access abortion services. Match CEO Shar Dubey said she has set up a fund for workers who need to travel out-of-state in order to have an abortion.

"22 MAR 2003: Elmira College celebrates their victory over Manhattanville following the Division 3 ... [+] Women's Ice Hockey Championships held at the Murray Athletic Center on the campus of Elmira College in Pine Valley, NY. Elmira College won its second consecutive NCAA Photos via Getty Images Championship with a 5-1 victory over Manhattanville College. Dick Blume/NCAA Photos via Getty Images Elmira College was sanctioned by the NCAA in late August 2021 for two major financial aid violations: failure to monitor and the awarding of merit based aid disproportionately to athletes versus regular students. This is a serious penalty for any institution, but the facts of the case should concern many higher education administrators because it could be happening on your campus. Elmira College in New York, a Division III school, is formerly an all-women’s college that currently enrolls nearly 800 students. According to their most recent Title IX report, the school has 259 male athletes and 474 female athletes. Like so many small colleges, they are battling for every student they can get. Let me explain the relevant issues. In Division III athletics, financial aid can be awarded either based on your financial need or for merit, of which athletics has traditionally been excluded. The final combination total scholarship amount is based on meeting the student’s total financial need (as defined by the FAFSA), and according to NCAA rules, the aid must be similarly awarded between athletes and non-athletes. For two academic years, this did not happen at Elmira. The NCAA “found that Elmira’s  college athletes had 91% of their financial need met on average, while those who were not student-athletes had only 64% of their need met. Similarly, during the 2019-20 academic year, student-athletes had 83% of their financial need met, while others had only 61% of their need met. The committee found that this variance was clearly distinguishable.” If this discrepancy had happened in Division I, can you imagine the uproar? (An announcement might look like this: “Today, the University of Texas was put on two years of probation because the NCAA determined that athletes received 91% of the merit-based aid, while the average student only received 64%.”) It is not likely that a decision of only two years of probation would be well received by the rest of Division I. I think a few members of the Power 5 conferences might object. Staff Photo by Faith Cathcart, Thursday, July 18, 2002: Monica Nieto is headed to Elmira College in ... [+] the fall. Of the three schools she applied to, all three accepted her. She says her decision to go to Elmira was based on finances. She has been awarded a scholarship and grants, and she plans on taking out student loans. (Photo by Faith Cathcart/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images) Elmira has placed much of the blame on a former vice-president of enrollment management’s strategy: students were awarded $1000 for visiting campus and/or completing the FAFSA form. In a time of a shrinking pool of available high school students in the Northeast portion of the United States, enrollment managers are fighting over the same pool of applicants.  ""Elmira failed to provide comprehensive rules education to the financial aid office and coaching staff members,"" the committee said in its decision. ""Most notably, no one monitored the former vice president of enrollment management's implementation of his enrollment strategies or the process of awarding financial aid to ensure compliance with financial aid legislation. These failures caused the violations to occur and go undetected for two academic years."" Today, the former vice-president has a “show-cause” order, meaning any NCAA school that chooses to hire him in the next two years would have to come before the association and demonstrate why he won’t do it again. In an interview with Elmira’s President Charles Lindsay, we discussed how something like this could happen. How could “no one” have monitored his enrollment or financial aid strategies?  First, according to Lindsay, the former vice-president oversaw both enrollment and athletics. When your job is to bring students to campus and hopefully see them enroll, it can be very difficult to have to tell a coach “No” to a group of recruits; while at the same time, your job is to oversee the alignment of the athletics program with the campus mission.  Secondly, Lindsay told me, the school overly relied on this employee to know the ins and outs of the NCAA rules. While the former vice president assured everyone around him that he knew the regulations, it became obvious he did not. Lindsay acknowledged that the “the key people on campus, including me, are all expected to go through an annual online training, and attestation.” Clearly, senior campus leaders such as enrollment officers, financial aid officers, housing and dining, and facilities employees must know the NCAA rules: in fact, the President is required to attest to that understanding every year or the institution will be suspended by the NCAA. But a fair question to ask is, where can they receive the training and who will monitor their understanding, especially as the rules evolve? Lindsay also shared an astute observation-he believes that too much training at the Division III level occurs after an incident has occurred and the damage is done. He continued, “since we are found in violation, and we're on two years’ probation, during those two years, our financial aid team, and a couple of others on campus are expected to go to some regional meetings, to learn about compliance and regulations, and I think that's a good thing.” Better late than never? Here's the takeaway from this story. As senior campus leaders move up the ladder, do Presidents (and others) oversee their orientation to NCAA policies and procedures? For the former vice-president, the release noted, “During that period, he (the former VP) must attend NCAA Regional Rules Seminars, and any NCAA member school employing him must restrict his involvement with NCAA financial aid legislation by requiring direct oversight from the athletic department's senior leadership on financial aid-related responsibilities.” Just wondering- whose job it is to enforce that directive? As small private Division III schools in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions are increasingly fighting over fewer and fewer recruits, Elmira’s situation is a cautionary tale. Unless more key senior leaders are effectively trained on the nuances of the NCAA rules on the front end, there are likely to be more cases of trying to entice students to enroll. Should it be a collective responsibility for all campus senior leaders to receive annual training? The resounding answer is yes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenweaver/2021/09/03/elmira-college-winner-of-multiple-national-championships-is-placed-on-probation/,"Elmira College, Winner Of Multiple National Championships, Is Placed On Probation"
"Clemson quarterback D.J. Uiagalelei looks for a receiver during the first quarter against Notre Dame ... [+] in an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 7, 2020, in South Bend, Ind. (Matt Cashore/Pool Photo via AP) D.J. Uiagalelei enrolled at Clemson in January 2020 with expectations he would become the program’s next great quarterback. He was the second-ranked quarterback and 10th overall prospect in his high school class, according to the 247Sports Composite ranking.  Uiagalelei joined the Tigers even though he knew he wouldn’t play much during his freshman year as Trevor Lawrence was entrenched as the starter. But when Lawrence tested positive for the coronavirus in late October, Uiagalelei started two consecutive games and excelled before heading back to the bench when Lawrence returned. Now, with Lawrence off to the NFL where he’s the Jacksonville Jaguars’ starter, Uiagalelei is Clemson’s first-stringer and among the most hyped players in the country.  Despite playing a limited role last season, Uiagalelei is tied with Alabama quarterback Bryce Young as the second-leading contender for the Heisman Trophy, according to BetMGM. The oddsmaker lists Uiagalelei and Young as +1100 odds, meaning a $100 bet would net $1,200. The favorite is Oklahoma quarterback Spencer Rattler, who is listed at +650, meaning a $100 bet would net $750.  On Saturday night, Uiagalelei has an early opportunity to make a name for himself in the Heisman race as No. 3 Clemson faces No. 5 Georgia in Charlotte, N.C., in the season opener for both teams and the weekend’s marquee matchup. He will square off against Georgia quarterback JT Daniels, who is listed at +1200 to win the Heisman, trailing only Rattler, Uiagalelei and Young. If Uiagalelei shines on Saturday and throughout the season, he could become Clemson’s first Heisman winner. Lawrence, the top pick in the 2021 NFL draft, finished second in last year’s Heisman voting, while Deshaun Watson was third in 2015 and second in 2016. Watson, the No. 12 pick in the 2017 draft, is now the Houston Texans’ starting quarterback.  Uiagalelei, who is 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, seems like a worthy successor to Lawrence and Watson and is already being mentioned as the potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft. During his freshman season, Uiagalelei completed 78 of 117 passes (66.7%) for 914 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions and gained 60 yards on 28 carries with four rushing touchdowns.  Uiagalelei displayed his skills last season with Lawrence out, completing 30 of 41 passes for 342 yards and two touchdowns and running for another score in a 34-28 victory over Boston College and helping the Tigers overcome an 18-point deficit. The next Saturday at Notre Dame, he went 29 of 44 for 439 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a touchdown. But the Tigers lost, 47-40, in double overtime.  “I think what I took from that (Notre Dame game) is every play matters,” Uiagalelei told reporters this week. “You need to make sure you’re locked in every single play. Those big games, that one little mistake can lead to a big outcome.” As usual, Clemson has a talented supporting cast surrounding a top-notch quarterback. Uiagalelei’s targets this year include wide receiver Justyn Ross, who missed last season due to injury. Ross caught 112 passes for 1,865 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2018 and 2019. Mel Kiper Jr., ESPN’s NFL draft analyst, lists Ross as the 25th ranked prospect for the 2022 draft.  The Tigers’ other starting receivers are likely to be junior Joseph Ngata, a former five-star recruit who’s battled injuries during his career but is poised for a productive year, and sophomore E.J. Williams, who had 24 catches for 306 yards last season. Meanwhile, running back Travis Etienne, a three-year starter for Clemson, is now playing in the NFL with the Jaguars. But Clemson has capable replacements in Lyn-J Dixon, Kobe Pace and Will Shipley.  Still, all eyes will be on Uiagalelei, who is looking to lead Clemson to its seventh consecutive College Football Playoff appearance. During that stretch, Clemson has won two national titles and lost in the championship game twice.  If Uiagalelei performs well, he will also benefit financially, as the NCAA in July allowed players for the first time to earn money from their name, image and likeness. Uiagalelei is the seventh-most valuable player in college football when it comes to NIL, according to OpenDorse, a marketplace that connects athletes and companies on marketing deals. OpenDorse bases its rankings on social media following and fan engagement.  In July, Uiagalelei signed Vayner Sports, a sports agency. Since then, he’s signed marketing deals with the Bojangles fast-food chain and Dr. Pepper, where he will appear on television advertisements for the soft drink brand. He could see more deals this season or next season, as well.  Starting on Saturday against Georgia, Uiagalelei will be in the national spotlight, a role he seems eager to embrace.  “For me, I want to be great, man,” he told reporters this week. “It’s as simple as that. I want to make sure when I step on the field, I’m read to go and my teammates are going to be able to count on me out there.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timcasey/2021/09/03/can-quarterback-dj-uiagalelei-become-clemsons-first-heisman-trophy-winner/,Can Quarterback D.J.

"Platforms producing oil in the North Sea over the Johan Sverdrup oil field, where Norways Equinor is ... [+] producing around 350,000 barrels per day, on December 3, 2019.  This week DNV made a live presentation of their Energy Transition Outlook 2021. This offered a forecast of things to come from an independent and reliable company. Oil and gas readers can get a better feel for the global role of government policy, the rate of changeover from fossil power plants to renewables, future oil and gas supplies, and liquid hydrogen.  DNV, based in Norway, is engaged in safeguarding life, property and the environment. DNV is committed to the safety and sustainability of business organizations. They provide classification and technical assurance along with software and independent expert advisory services to the maritime, oil and gas, and energy industries.  Below are several highlights of the two-hour program. To hit the high points efficiently, I have not included full attributions, as they can be found in the reports. Energy policy is key. To illustrate, China is a leading investor in the transition, even up to buying scarce metals needed for solar and battery construction. Norway’s goal is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) 50-55% by 2030, and to decarbonize fossil fuels. They have a culture of innovation that leads in shipping, offshore wind power, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The country has successfully incentivized electric vehicles (EVs) so that 60% of new vehicles sold are EVs. Global warming needs collaboration between countries, since it’s a worldwide problem, but there is a short window for action. Norway will support vulnerable countries but notes that 12 out of 20 countries that are most vulnerable to global warming are engaged in violent military conflict. So climate change security is important. DNV president Remi Eriksen said Norway is a model for the European Green Deal and is seeking partnerships with other countries. One of the biggest challenges is that rules and regulations are overwhelming and need to be uniformized between countries.  Figure 1 DNV’s prediction (Figure 1) is that for 5 years there will be no improvement in the ratio of fossil vs renewable energies. But after this, GHG will fall by 9% by 2030 and by 45% in 2050. But the GHG emissions by 2050 will be close to 20 Giga-tons per year (Gt/yr) and a long way from true-zero emissions – and too far for carbon capture storage (CCS) to bury the “leftovers” underground and get the world to net-zero. On the positive side. 25% of global electricity is now renewable and is growing at a good clip: transport is a big factor in this. Wind and solar are forecast to be almost equal by 2050 (Figure 2). Coal just about exits by 2050, but gas-fired power plants are a stayer and still at 22% by 2050.  Figure 2 Future oil and gas supplies. Globally, oil and coal supplies are forecast to fall steadily after 2025 (Figure 3). But natural gas is the one fossil fuel that remains fairly constant through 2050. This adds credence to the concept of natural gas as a halfway house between fossil and renewable energies. But in 2050, 85% of the gas is not decarbonized. The remaining fraction of 15% consists of biomethane and natural gas supply with CCS to offset the carbon.  Figure 3 Personal energy efficiency. This may be an “unsung hero” as DNV projects 133 GJ/person in Europe in 2019 will fall to 95 GJ/person by 2050. This is a 29% dropoff, and more government mandates would accelerate this. Hard-to-abate sectors. These are shown in Figure 4 and by far the worst is industrial heat. Examples are steel and cement manufacturing. Although total GHG emissions will have fallen by 45% between 2019 and 2050, the hard-to-abate sectors will be almost half of all remaining emissions. Figure 4 Liquid hydrogen. This will only be 5% of all energies by 2050, mostly because it will come to the marketplace too late. Hydrogen is expensive now, and it will take until 2033 to equal the price of solar and wind in 2010-2015. Prices fall of course but if 2020 is a reference marker, it will take until 2045 for hydrogen to reach the price in 2020. It seems a case of too little too late. The DNV president ended by emphasizing that, after all the progress achieved, to meet the Paris goal of 1.5C temperature rise would require speeding up of electrification by renewables­­, and accelerating hydrogen production.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianpalmer/2021/09/03/dnvs-energy-transition-outlook-2021-offers-an-independent-view-of-oil-and-gas-through-2050/,DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2021 Offers An Independent View Of Oil And Gas Through 2050
"The rate of children and teens hospitalized because of the coronavirus increased nearly five times in mid-August—and 10 times, for children under four—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in two key studies released Friday, which also showed the worst rates of children struggling with the disease happening in the states with lower vaccination rates.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 22: Melissa Moy, a teacher at Yung Wing School P.S. 124, goes over a ... [+] lesson on a monitor with in-person Summer program students on July 22, 2021 in New York City. Positive COVID-19 cases in some New York City public schools have resulted in classroom quarantines. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images) The rate of children with coronavirus who end up hospitalized is 49.7 per 100,000 children as of August 14, with the highest rate of hospitalizations among kids under the age of 4 (69%) followed by teens between the ages of 12-17 (64%).  Hospitalizations began to climb due to the spread of the delta variant in mid-August, when many students returned to school, and children and teen hospitalizations increased nearly five times mid-August compared to the end of July, while hospitalizations for children under the age of 4 increased 10 times during the same period. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for children and teens were the highest in states with the lowest Covid-19 vaccine rates, particularly southern states, during a two-week period in August. Emergency department and hospitalization admissions for children happened 3.4 and 3.7 times more, respectively, in states with lower Covid-19 vaccination rates compared with those that had higher vaccination rates during the month of August, according to data from the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System. Unvaccinated teenagers are nearly 10 times more likely to be hospitalized compared to their unvaccinated peers, according to CDC data collected from hospitals in 14 states in July.  The new studies follow a record-breaking month for U.S. children hospitalizations, with 330 children admitted daily between August 20 and August 26, according to the CDC. The rise in hospitalizations coincide with the return to school for many students along with the rising spread of the delta variant in all states throughout the U.S. Southern states like Florida, where Gov. Ron Desantis previously banned schools from enacting mask mandates, and Alabama, which has one of lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. at just 36% of its residents fully vaccinated, have seen some of the highest kid hospitalizations in the nation. Covid-19 vaccinations among eligible teens are also lagging, with 46% of 16 - 17-year-olds and 37% of 12 - 15-year-olds fully vaccinated as of September 1, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The CDC noted that following its recommendations for universal masking, social distancing and getting vaccinated if eligible in schools is still the best way to prevent the spread of the virus among kids. Despite growing Covid-19 hospitalizations for children, the CDC says “there isn’t increased disease severity in children” associated with the delta variant. However, children can experience severe symptoms from the virus that requires them to use a ventilator or face complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can cause symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, skin rash, bloodshot eyes, change in skin color, and difficulty breathing. Child deaths from Covid-19 remain “uncommon,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP reported that from data collected by 45 states, between 0.00% and 0.03% of child Covid-19 cases resulted in death.

The definitive tentpole fantasy franchise of the 2000s, which began with a record $93 million opening weekend and $974 million global gross (second only to Titanic at the time) in November 2001 and ended with a record $169 million opening weekend and $1.34 billion global cume (behind only Titanic and Avatar at the time) in July of 2011 essentially has two homes.  The films obviously belong to Warner Bros., but the theme park attractions (where much of the fandom is nurtured) belongs to Universal Studios. Anyway, to mark the occasion, and since I’ve never sat and done this before, I have used science, math and dark magic to create the the official, 104% accurate ranking of all eight Harry Potter movies.

It also has to try and tell a supernatural murder mystery where no one actually dies, but it still gets gets for some genuinely terrifying creature effects (the deluge of spiders and the final monster are absolutely trying to scare your kids senseless). However, even in this “inessential” chapter, Richard Harris’ Dumbledore offers up the key thesis of the saga, namely that a person’s value is not about their destiny or lineage but rather about the choices they make in good times and bad.

We get almost no “origins of Voldemort” material and very little in terms of Snape’s backstory, instead saving that for one long montage in the final picture. Moreover, and this is not necessarily a criticism (because it works for this adaptation, but the film painfully telegraphs what in the book was a jaw-dropping plot twist. Even with an overindulgence in hormonal hijinks, this one still works as a visual differentiation while Tom Felton’s Malfoy shines as a young man tortured by the implications of actually doing evil as opposed to merely “being” evil.

Even so, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Ruper Grint nail the core characters with able support from the likes of Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. The mystery is (obviously) kids stuff, but the film works as a refreshingly stand-alone story which didn’t feel the need to offer an entire saga’s worth of loose ends. That’s another example of Hollywood learning the wrong lessons from a blockbuster smash. At the very least, Chris Columbus deserved a special Oscar for casting this entire saga pitch perfect from the start.

The film refreshingly upends the comparatively conventional visual template, including putting Harry and his friends in civilian clothes and giving the adult cast a stake in the core story, but it’s also among the few that more-or-less requires you to have read the book to get the nitty-gritty details. Also, Gary Oldman’s Sirius Black has too little screen time, although Harry’s friendship with Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is an emotional highlight and a delight for those of us who “discovered” Thewlis in Naked Lunch, The Island of Dr. Moreau and/or Dragonheart.

Rowling’s books results in a merely “very good” feature film adaptation. While I get Mike Newell’s decision to omit most of the non-Harry Potter material from the infamously long source material, the film ends up having a certain episodic feel. Moreover, in a chapter that should be filled with melodrama, the “stiff upper lip” British mentality makes it feel a bit more functional than it should while the visiting schools hilariously reinforce certain gender stereotypes (Clémence Poésy’s Fleur Delacour is miserable in each TriWizard competition). Nonetheless, the action scenes are pretty great, the climax works despite itself and Ralph Fiennes (cast to type) makes a fine entrance as Voldemort in the flesh. Robert Pattinson’s entrance as the doomed Cedric Diggory made my jam-packed IMAX showing sigh with thirst/lust. They weren’t wrong.

Nonetheless, if the last 2/3 feel a little rushed, with much of the “battle of Hogwarts” feeling a little truncated, at least it doesn’t wear out its welcome. This series finale nails the landing, giving big character moments (including Julie Walters’ Molly Weasley righteously killing of Helena Bonham Carter’s Bellatrix Lestrange) to everyone of consequence and prioritizing a satisfying finale over jaw-dropping twists. Rickman shines, the forest walk hits like a ton of bricks, and the Harry/Voldemort showdown cleverly adds a physicality to what was mostly a point-and-shoot duel.  Oh, and the epilogue is as effective now as it was in print form. These kids didn’t want to be kings and masters, they just (like Sam and Frodo) wanted to live another day. Especially ten years later, after so many other pop culture juggernauts came to a whimpering end, it’s beyond impressive that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II just ended its story in a logical and satisfying fashion without trying to outsmart the fans or subvert expectations. Hell, in this pop culture, a smooth landing is the biggest surprise of all. Had it all ended here, without the thus-far botched prequel franchise (and, yeah, without the author earning the ire of her fandom), I still think Harry Potter would still stand alongside (or above) Star Wars as a definitive pop culture myth.

David Yates made his “Wizarding World” directorial debut with this fifth film. Michael Goldenberg took over (just this once) for regular screenwriter Steven Kloves and cut the source material to the bone, creating a coming-of-age adventure whereby our young heroes were left to fend for themselves as the outside world (and the adult authority figures in their midst) either turned on them or were unable to help. With nobody believing that Voldemort was actually back, it’s up to Harry to actually earn his stripes and teach his classmates to defend themselves, as this thrilling chapter culminates with a wizard battle royal that highlights all the heroes and villains kicking each other’s asses in IMAX-friendly fashion.

The heroic trio has to fend for itself as their allies perish at the hands of Voldemort’s empowered genocidal army. Concurrently, now the actors have to step up as they all deliver franchise-best performances. While the film is generally a character-driven tone poem, drenched in fear and despair, it does have several exciting and exceedingly tense action scenes. As a stand-alone picture, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part I is a pitiless plunge into hell, a sad and bitter drama where beloved childhood memories vanish in a puff of figurative (or in Hermione's case, literal) waves of a wand. Seven films in, Harry Potter gets its Empire Strikes Back, and it’s awesome.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/03/harry-potter-movies-worst-to-best/,All 8 ‘Harry Potter’ Movies Ranked Worst To Best
"Lady Gaga attends The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art ... [+] on May 06, 2019 in New York City | Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Over a year after the album’s release, Lady Gaga is taking her Little Monsters back to planet Chromatica. The remix album Dawn of Chromatica is out today, and the award-winning singer and actress linked up with some of the music industry’s hottest names today to put their own spins on her beloved 2020 dance LP Chromatica.  Fans first got a taste of what was to come in April of this year when Chromatica producer BloodPop hinted that he was back in the kitchen cooking with Gaga. “In theory - which artists would y’all want to see on a Chromatica remix album (and on what song)?” he said slyly. He threw out a name himself: Japanese-British breakout singer Rina Sawayama. Gaga expressed her excitement in August as the project was being finished. “The Chromatica remix album is so f*cking fuego,” she said proudly. “Music is life.” For Dawn of Chromatica, Gaga recruited some of the best and brightest artists, producers, and DJs in the business, many of which are rising stars themselves. Grammy-nominated producer Arca offers her own dancefloor-ready take on “Rain On Me,” while the remix for Chromatica lead single “Stupid Love” is handled by French producer COUCOU CHLOE. Charli XCX joins the party for “911,” and Brazilian pop star Pabllo Vittar gives a rare English performance on “Fun Tonight.” And after BloodPop teased a possible collabor with Rina Sawayama, the singer joined Gaga for the remix of “Free Woman.” The album even contains two versions of closing track “Babylon”: a remix with burgeoning British rapstress Bree Runway, and a demo of the original “Babylon” track that has been used in ads for Gaga’s Haus Labs beauty brand (fittingly dubbed the “Haus Labs Version”).  “I invite you to dance to this album in celebration of young artists all over the world,” Gaga said in an Instagram post celebrating Dawn of Chromatica’s release. “Artists who see the world, feel the world, and put that feeling into something bigger than all of us: music.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2021/09/03/lady-gaga-invites-charli-xcx-arca-and-more-music-stars-into-her-world-on-dawn-of-chromatica-remix-album/,"Lady Gaga Invites Charli XCX, Arca, and More Music Stars Into Her World on ‘Dawn of Chromatica’ Remix Album"
"Actor Christopher Lloyd Rick and Morty first originated as a crude Back to the Future parody, created by Justin Roiland for co-creator Dan Harmon's short-film festival. Now, Doc Brown himself, Christopher Lloyd, has officially appeared as Rick Sanchez in a new promo for the show released by Adult Swim.   The 14-second clip shows Rick and Morty jumping out of another portal, right into the live-action dimension, with Lloyd as a pitch-perfect Rick and Jaeden Martell (Knives Out) playing Morty.  Lloyd then repeats Han Solo’s iconic line from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, saying “Morty, we’re home.” Of course, the line read is interrupted by a good belch.  Martell delivers a signature “aww jeez,” and the clip ends. It’s ambiguous, and intriguing. Is Rick and Morty’s season 5 finale is going to crossover into reality, or is this just another promo that shows off a different style for the titular two?  There have been several official Rick and Morty shorts that play with different visuals, such as pixel art, stop-motion, and anime, so perhaps this is merely the latest experiment from Adult Swim.  But the clip was posted on Twitter with the code “C-132,” which is the name of Rick and Morty’s “original” universe - this could be a clue to the canonical significance of the clip, and a hint of things to come. That being said, the clip could simply be a bit of fan service, as fans have always believed that Lloyd would make a perfect live-action Rick (although, recently, fans have proposed that former Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi could do the job).  The cameo also seemed to have delivered a longtime dream for Lloyd, who once told the Phoenix New Times that he'd seen ""a few episodes"" of Rick and Morty and ""think it's a lot of fun,"" before mentioning that he would like to guest star on the show. Whether this is just a one-off, or a teaser for incoming multiverse madness, we will soon see how the show closes season 5, with the two-part finale due to air on Sunday at 11 p.m. ET on Adult Swim.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2021/09/03/rick-and-morty-goes-full-circle-as-christopher-lloyd-appears-as-rick-sanchez/,‘Rick And Morty’ Goes Full Circle As Christopher Lloyd Appears As Rick Sanchez
"Affirm Stock Skyrockets 40% on News Amazon to Partner with Buy Now, Pay Later Fintech Company Affirm shares jumped 40% in the after-hours session Friday after the fintech company said it has partnered with Amazon to allow a pay-over-time option at Amazon’s checkout. Select Amazon customers will have the option to split the total cost of purchases of $50 or more, and Amazon plans to make Affirm available to more customers in the coming months. Amazon “is always looking to add flexible payment options, and Affirm does just that” with no late or hidden fees. Buy Now, Pay Later companies such as Affirm allow consumers to buy in installments and charge them either simple interest or no interest at all and with instant access to what they bought. [MarketWatch] PayPal appears to be taking on Robinhood by offering stock trading to customers PayPal's About to Take on Robinhood PayPal is taking its first steps toward developing and registering an investment platform within PayPal called Invest at PayPal, and it could launch next year. Rival Square added stock trading, including fractional share trading, to its app in 2019, taking on the popular brokerage app Robinhood. Now, PayPal is ready to follow in Square's footsteps again. PayPal has the advantage of serving over 400 million active accounts, most of which have linked their bank account information to the platform already. By comparison, Robinhood reports having just 21 million active accounts, and Cash App has about 40 million users. That makes PayPal a significant threat to Robinhood as the former is also looking to attract first-time investors.

BNPL is a way to spread out interest-free payments for consumers, who can also avoid late fees if they pay on time. They also can sidestep credit card balances that accrue with interest until the cardholder pays them off. Two recent events give validity to views that it's a long-term trend, not a flash-in-the-pan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Digital payment company Square on Aug. 1 agreed to purchase BNPL provider Afterpay in an all-stock, $29 billion deal. Then Amazon announced Aug. 27 that it's working with Affirm, sending its shares soaring. Amazon said it's testing Affirm's BNPL plans on orders of $50 or more. The e-commerce giant plans to make BNPL more broadly available in the coming months. All these players have an eye toward younger consumers. [Investor’s Business Daily] J.D.

But consumers are also warming to stronger authentication methods as they become more exposed to them on their smartphones and other devices.

"Liz Cooper is embracing her newfound confidence and rock influences on her most recent album.  According to astrology, Saturn returns to its placement in the sky when a person was born every 27–29 years. A person’s Saturn Return is said to accompany many major life changes, like divorces or career shifts, that propel a person into adulthood.  Liz Cooper, the singer-songwriter who formerly released music under the band name Liz Cooper & The Stampede, is experiencing her Saturn Return. She’s 29, and says the last two years have been the most emotionally tumultuous of her life so far. But she’s coming out on the other side of Saturn with a stronger sense of self, and an album to accompany it. On Sept. 3, Cooper’s album Hot Sass is out on Thirty Tigers Records.  Hot Sass is the follow-up to Coopers 2018 album Window Flowers, which received critical acclaim for its groovy combination of folk and psychedelia. The titles of these two projects suggest their essential difference: in Hot Sass, Cooper abandons banjo and ambience for a more forward psych-rock sound. The title track announces itself with guitars, establishing Cooper as a riot girl Eight-minute songs like “Lucky Charm” include extensive interludes that recall The Doors.  When Cooper wrote the record in 2019, she was nearing the end of her Window Flowers tour. She was overextending herself, trying to conform to the expectations of a culture prioritizing output over mental health. She became fed up. She was tired of giving in to other people’s desires, and expressed this discontent in her songwriting.  “I pushed myself too far, and for what?” Cooper asks. “I’m just trying to find balance. There’s more to life than doing this.”  Cooper moved to Nashville to start Liz Cooper & The Stampede when she was 19. According to Cooper, the band’s name arose after she absorbed Nashville’s culture. She loves old country music — “those are the O.G. emo records,” she says — but over the years, has increasingly felt as if the band’s name confined her to country and Americana. A stampede of horses doesn’t scream psychedelic rock.  “I love my band,” Cooper says. “I trust them very much, and they worked really hard on this record, I just didn’t want to hide behind the name anymore.” After consulting with her band — comprised of Ryan Usher, Joe Bisirri, and Michael Libramento — they agreed to drop the moniker and its connotations. They took Hot Sass to Burlington, Vermont, to work with producer Benny Yurco (Michael Nau).  Thus, Hot Sass is both a moment in Cooper’s personal evolution and the band’s musical one.  Hot Sass is, according to Cooper, “this madness that I've been more comfortable with accepting and like, this attitude that I do possess that I've been hiding from. It's this confidence and sexiness, it's something that I've always been very afraid of. It's me learning about what kind of woman I am and It's not pretty all the time. It's not this thing that you can put in a box.” One might expect for this confidence and assertiveness to inspire increased commentary on current events. But since finishing the record in 2019, Cooper has redirected creative attention to painting and playing the piano. Public figures, especially musicians, are often expected to have something to say about the state of affairs. But Cooper does’t feel prepared to make any kind of statements — she’s still figuring herself out.  “I don’t always have something to say,” she says. ""There’s still so much happening, and I don’t feel like I have my thoughts organized enough to get them out on paper. I journal, but I’ve mostly been enjoying painting because it’s physical.” “It's just another way to expose my insides, which scares me but also makes me feel whole and healed. I love to paint because I don't feel any pressure from myself or from anyone else. It's just fun and it's pure. Purely expressive.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/riannaturner/2021/09/03/liz-cooper-drops-band-name-to-release-hot-sass/,Liz Cooper Drops Band Name To Release ‘Hot Sass’
"Interest in ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug falsely touted as a Covid-19 cure, has soared in the U.S. alongside rising cases, hospitalizations and deaths from coronavirus, with online searches for the drug spiking—along with  calls to poison control from people taking versions of a drug meant for animals—especially in these states.   Ivermectin is not recommended as a treatment or prevention for Covid-19. Google Trends data from the past 12 months show a sharp increase in U.S. searches for “ivermectin” starting to rise around the middle of July and reaching peak interest in the last week of August and the first week of September. The five states searching for “ivermectin” the most—relative to the number of overall searches in that state—over this time period were, in descending order: Oklahoma, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, states with some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Data from the last seven days highlights a similar, though shifting, picture, with Oregon, Oklahoma and Arkansas, respectively, the three states searching most for the drug and Idaho coming in fifth. Hawaii—the state with the third-highest proportion (74%) of people with at least one vaccination shot—was a notable exception, having the fourth-highest proportion of Web searches for ivermectin of all states. Google Shopping search data from the last seven days underscores widespread interest in obtaining the drug for treating or preventing Covid-19 despite it not being approved for this purpose, and searches spiked most in states with poor vaccine coverage—though Hawaii was again an exception to this and had the most searches for the term “ivermectin,” followed by Oklahoma, Wyoming, Arkansas and North Dakota. There was also a general surge in related queries on Google Shopping over the past seven days, including “ivermectin coronavirus” and “ivermectin apple paste,” an apparently popular product meant for horses, which both jumped 250% nationwide, and “ivermectin covid 19 treatment,” which jumped 170%. While the Food and Drug Administration says ivermectin should not be used to treat or prevent Covid-19, it is authorized for human use in the U.S. to treat some parasite infestations and the skin condition rosacea. In spite of this warning, prescriptions for the drug have soared. Experts are more concerned about those seeking the drug who can’t obtain a prescription, however, with many reportedly turning to more readily available products intended for livestock, according to regulators, poison control centers and hospital workers. Animal supply stores report unprecedented demand for the drug. Google Shopping search data from the last week underscores widespread efforts to secure the drug, with terms inquiring about human dosage, various animal products (usually assorted formulations or pastes for cows or horses) and getting a prescription jumping from 40% to 100%. With increasing numbers of people seeking out ivermectin meant for animals—which does not undergo the rigorous vetting human medication does, is potentially much stronger and could contain harmful additives—already struggling hospitals could be facing an uptick in patients who have unwittingly overdosed.   Worldwide interest in ivermectin has started to swing toward the U.S., according to Google search data. For most of the pandemic, searches for the drug have been popular in countries like South Africa, Namibia and Slovakia. Slovakia’s government promoted the drug and black markets emerged in Namibia and South Africa to meet demand. More recent data, especially over the last month, shows an increasing—and now leading—proportion of global searches for the antiparasitic coming from the U.S. U.S. searches linking ivermectin and the 2015 Nobel Prize have increased by more than 1,000% in the last week. The drug did indeed earn its discoverers the 2015 Nobel Prize, something which is featured prominently in the materials of people promoting the drug for use against Covid-19 online. The award was not, however, for its apparent utility against Covid-19. The awarding committee commended the discoverers for having provided “humankind with powerful new means to combat . . . debilitating diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people annually” caused by parasites. Other Nobel-winning innovations that are also not proven to help tackle Covid-19 have not received levels of enthusiasm similar those of to ivermectin. In 1949, Antonio Egas Moniz shared the prize for his development of the lobotomy, a controversial—and now discredited—surgical procedure to cut away parts of the brain in the hope of curing mental illness.  Ivermectin showed early promise as a Covid-19 treatment. These have not borne out and multiple, rigorous studies undertaken since have repeatedly determined the drug to be of no benefit in treating people with Covid-19. One of the most promising papers supporting the drug’s use was withdrawn over concerns of data manipulation. Neither its manufacturer nor leading medicines’ regulators endorse its use for Covid-19 and actively recommend against this. Despite this, ivermectin has quickly acquired a reputation as a “miracle cure” and has been embraced around the world throughout the pandemic, particularly in Latin America, South Africa, the Philippines and India and by many, typically vaccine-resistant, groups in the U.S. As with many matters related to the pandemic, online misinformation is rife. Ivermectin is no exception, and major platforms like Amazon, Reddit and Facebook have all taken steps to address reported issues on their respective platforms.  Is Ivermectin The New Hydroxychloroquine?

"A handful of House Democrats on Tuesday introduced long-shot legislation to fundamentally reshape the Supreme Court, which comes amid pressure from progressives to take action over a recent Court decision that left in place a controversial Texas abortion law. WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 22: A morning commuter walks passed the U.S. Supreme Court on June 22, 2021 in ... [+] Washington, DC. The court is expected to release more opinions for cases related to voting rights, donor disclosure and student’s first amendment rights, as it finishes up the final days of it’s annual term. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The bill, introduced by Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Don Beyer (D-Va.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) would create 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices, though it would not apply to justices currently serving. The bill would also give presidents the ability to nominate a new justice every two years and require the Senate to act on each nomination within 120 days before the nominee is automatically seated. There is debate among constitutional scholars as to whether such reforms require a constitutional amendment: Thomas Berry of the libertarian Cato Institute argues the term limits are a “close call” but the Senate deadline is “no doubt” unconstitutional. Beyer spokesperson Aaron Fritschner told Forbes the lawmakers are confident the bill passes constitutional muster in an “academic/legal analyst sense,” but added that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, could strike it down anyway: “There is an X factor on basically everything, obviously.” Packaging the reforms as a bill, rather than a constitutional amendment, means it can pass with just a simple majority in the House – though the bill would still be unlikely to pass the Senate, where support from 10 Republicans is needed to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold. The legislation came just ahead of a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday allowing a Texas law banning nearly all abortions to stay in place while it’s hashed out by lower courts, prompting outcry from Democrats and renewed demands to reform the Court. The bill’s provisions are a direct response to recent maneuvering in Congress over Supreme Court nominations. Democrats are still smarting over Senate Republicans’ refusal to consider now-Attorney General Merrick Garland when he was nominated for the Court in 2016, and over the swift confirmation of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett just a week before the 2020 election. The idea of 18-year term limits dates back to a proposal from Duke University law professor Paul Carrington in 2005. Some Democrats are calling on 83-year-old liberal Justice Stephen Breyer to retire so that President Joe Biden can nominate his successor while Democrats hold the Senate. Breyer appears to be considering the move, telling the New York Times last month, “I don’t think I’m going to stay there till I die — hope not,” and that ideological considerations will “inevitably be in the psychology” of his decision. “The high-stakes confirmation hearings that occur every time there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court undermine the reputation of our highest judicial body,” Khanna said in a statement, calling the bill a “meaningful step towards standardizing and democratizing the Supreme Court.” These reforms could get more mainstream backing if blessed by a commission created by Biden in April to study the issue. The commission, made up of court experts, former judges, scholars and lawyers, is examining the “membership and size” of the Court, as well as the “length of service and turnover of justices.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/03/democrats-introduce-bill-creating-18-year-supreme-court-term-limits-nominations-every-two-years/,"Democrats Introduce Bill Creating 18-Year Supreme Court Term Limits, Nominations Every Two Years"
"VIVO - (L-R) GABI (voiced by Ynairaly Simo) and VIVO (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda). ©2021 SPAI. All Rights Reserved. In SVOD news courtesy of Nielsen for the week of August 2 to August 9, Sony Animation’s Vivo, another pretty great original animated feature that was supposed to be in theaters but ended up sold to Netflix during the pandemic, debuted at the top of Nielsen’s film-specific streaming charts. Vivo (co-written by In the Heights co-writer Quiara Alegría Hudes) nabbed 493 million minutes in its first frame, which comes out to around 5.7 million viewings presuming most folks turned off the 99-minute feature when the credits began at 86 minutes. Considering it’s still in the top ten at the moment I expect to see some real legs for the first few weeks of its release.  Helmed by Space Chimps/The Croods director Kirk DeMicco, this long-in-development project (from back in 2010, after DeMicco saw In the Heights on Broadway) stars Lin-Manuel Miranda as a singer-musician kinkajou who partakes in a journey to deliver a love song after his human companion dies before professing his affections to a long-ago flame. The songs are fun, and the film toes the line between kid-friendly hijinks and a genuine sense of melancholy over lives not lived and chances not taken. Like The Mitchells Vs. the Machines, Vivo might have been a halfway decent theatrical hit in a non-Covid world, although original animated films were struggling post-Coco well before the pandemic.  Nonetheless, Sony Animation has been on a real roll in terms of high-quality animated features that don’t rely on IP or brands to make the case. At the very least, I worry (especially with Sony selling Hotel Transylvania: Transformania to Amazon for $100 million) that Sony has let its entire animation legacy become just another feature in a streamer’s victory cap. For a studio that championed theatrical exclusivity and seems trying to be the last conventional major movie studio in town, they’ve sold quite a few movies to the likes of Amazon, HBO Max, Apple, Netflix and Hulu.  That’s not a moral judgment, but I don’t have to like it.  Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt's 'Jungle Cruise' Disney’s Jungle Cruise showed staying power, logging 407 million minutes viewed. That’s a 16% jump from its first frame of “on Disney+ for $30” availability, implying that folks decided to take the plunge after opening weekend. That’s not a surprise, as A) it’s less “the fans got to see it right now” than Black Widow and B) Dwayne Johnson’s family-friendly jungle adventures (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Jumanji: The Next Level, Rampage, Journey 2, etc.) tend to stick around as consensus pick family movie night offerings and relative comfort watches.  That’s around three million complete viewings of the 135-minute Dwayne Johnson/Emily Blunt flick, which just nabbed a sequel after topping $100 million domestic. Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar’s “Luca” is a coming-of-age story about a boy and his newfound best friend experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. But their fun is threatened by a secret: they are sea monsters from another world. “Luca” is directed by Enrico Casarosa (“La Luna”) and produced by Andrea Warren (“Lava,” “Cars 3”). © 2020 Disney/Pixar. All Rights Reserved. Pixar’s Luca continues to be unstoppable, logging another 336 million minutes around six weeks after its debut as a “free” offering on Disney+. Equally leggy are Raya and the Last Dragon (160 million minutes) and, yes, Moana (142 million minutes) which has been one of the “top-trending” movies since the launch of Disney+ in November 2019. The other amusing entry in the movie list is The Losers. Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A DC Comics adaptation starring Idris Elba about a group of rogue mercenaries who go on a suicide mission overseas in order to clear their names and/or save the day. It’s placement on Netflix (328 million minutes for around 3.4 million viewings) in early August is a cosmic coincidence.  Idris Elba and Sylvester Stallone in James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad' If HBO Max participated in these Nielsen lists, we’d have more info as to how many folks watched the well-reviewed but comparatively ignored ($155 million worldwide in theaters on a $185 million budget) The Suicide Squad on the streaming platform over opening weekend. The latest update is around 4.7 million households (at least accounting for 28 million American smart TVs monitored by Samba) in the first 17 days. The “opening weekend” was 2.8 million households, which translates into roughly 369 million minutes viewed for the 132-minute movie. That’s obviously a spitball guestimate. Much of what we get is either third-party or existing entirely within a vacuum to justify any narrative about success or failure.  Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Columbus Short, Idris Elba and Óscar Gajo in 'The Losers' The Losers (also starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans, Zoe Saldana) still holds up as a successful variation of the kind of unapologetic B movie which Netflix now tries desperately to approximate. It was a flop theatrically ($30 million on a $25 million budget), which was evidence even then that Idris Elba was generally not a butts-in-seats draw, alas. The film is refreshingly horny by today’s standards, and it’s no less cynical about overseas imperialism and profit-driven politics as The Suicide Squad or The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Such a viewpoint was considered “just a movie” even a year after James Cameron’s Avatar was held up as exceptional left-wing propaganda for having the exact same politics as Aliens 23 years earlier.  Evans is playing his standard pre-Captain America smart-ass, and it’s a damn good thing he got the Steve Rogers gig when he did. Ryan Reynolds was about to steal his shtick, leaving him in a similar pickle as Jason Lee back in the day. Beyond that, the movie is yet another late-2000s/early-2010s Hollywood bomb that briefly became a big deal on Netflix, either because folks were catching up after having missed it in theaters or because it got tossed into the recommendation algorithm after they watched Gunpowder Milkshake. Streamers are as dependent, if not more so, on third-party studio programmers as online-friendly, media-friendly originals. Netflix gets this (hence the first pay-tv window deal with Sony), but we’ll see if anyone else does.

"Photo by: STRF/STAR MAX/IPx 2021 4/20/21 A Warby Parker store is seen in Brooklyn, New York. Last week, two Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) darlings, Warby Parker and AllBirds filed their S-1 registrations with the SEC in preparation of making an initial public offering. The filings give significant new visibility into the performance of these private companies, and that performance reveals a lot about the state of the commerce industry. Historically, the market has supported two distinct business models. Brands, such as P&G, which sell their products wholesale to retailers, and retailers, such as Kroger 
  
  KR 
 , who buy the goods from brands and resell them to consumers. In the last decade, DTC has emerged as the third model. Although not a new idea (producers selling their own goods to consumers, predates the wholesale model), DTC has gained significant popularity in the e-commerce era, with many new brands emerging that sell their own goods directly to consumers via e-commerce sites. In 2016, Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos coined the term “Digitally Native Vertical Brands” or DNVBs to describe the flood a new brands that were embracing this DTC model. A cursory scan of the e-commerce trade press would have you believe this digital version of DTC is the most successful product innovation since sliced bread. The truth, as revealed by Warby Parker and AllBirds S-1 filings, is far more complicated. Warby Parker, which in many ways is the poster child for DNVBs, generated $393 million in sales in 2020, its biggest year of sales and still growing, with 33% net growth in the previous twelve months. Yet Warby Parker, like most other DNVBs has failed to generate a profit. The problem is customer acquisition costs. Most DNVBs experience their initial growth by relying on digital ads placed on Facebook and Google to drive shoppers to their website. Yet, as these companies scale, they require even more new customers in an increasingly competitive environment, which drives the costs of those digital ads up, and makes customer acquisition more expensive. Warby Parker has mitigated those customer acquisition costs by opening 145 of its own retail stores which effectively serve as revenue generating billboards for the brand. In fact some DNVBs including Casper and Harry’s have even partnered with retailers like Target 
  
  TGT 
  and Walmart 
  
  WMT 
  on a traditional wholesale basis to try and improve customer acquisition costs at scale. Warby Parker reported a blended customer acquisition cost of $27 for 2019 (the last non-pandemic year), which is quite reasonable for a business that generates $72 in contribution profit per order. Daniel McCarthy, a Marketing Professor at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University, and a guru in customer value calculations, identified a significant wrinkle: Warby Parker uses a “novel” definition of customer acquisition costs, because they apply their costs against all active customers, and not just newly acquired ones. This means the costs to acquire new customers (traditionally the definition of CAC), is probably significantly higher. After more than ten years of operations, Warby Parker, perhaps the best example of a DNVB, even with the advantage of 145 of its own stores, is still less than halfway to $1B in annual sales or any profitability. Pedestrians walk past an Allbirds Inc. store in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. ... [+] 17, 2021. The U.S. economy started 2021 with a bang as retail sales and factory output accelerated and expectations continue to build for another jolt of government stimulus, setting the stage for what could be the best year of economic growth in nearly four decades. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Similarly, AllBirds reported $219 million in 2020, its top year to date, and lost nearly $26 million on those sales. AllBirds has also turned to opening stores, to help improve its customer acquisition costs. ""We have just scratched the surface of our store potential, particularly in the United States, with 27 stores globally as of June 30, 2021,"" per the company’s prospectus. ""We are in the early phase of a ramp towards hundreds of potential locations in the future."" The take-away is that despite generating buzz and raising a lot of capital, these DVNB challengers are struggling to economically challenge the traditional wholesale and retail model. That is not to say that some DNVBs can’t or won’t be successful, but it’s clear that simply being a DNVB is not a competitive advantage. P&G owns more than 22 brands that each sell more than $1B annually. Target has launched 11 brands in the past two years that each sell over $1B annually. It turns out that owning an existing relationship with customers (in the case of incumbent retailers), or strong customer awareness and distribution (in the case of incumbent brands) are formidable advantages that DNVBs are struggling to overcome.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasongoldberg/2021/09/03/surprising-learnings-from-warby-parker-and-allbirds-ipo-filings/,Surprising Learnings From Warby Parker And AllBirds IPO Filings
"Minnesota Timberwolves' Juancho Hernangomez (41) plays in an NBA basketball game against the Denver ... [+] Nuggets, Thursday, May 13, 2021, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) The Celtics’ busy offseason continued Friday, as Boston reportedly traded Kris Dunn, Carsen Edwards and a 2026 second-round pick swap to the Memphis Grizzlies for 6-foot-9 forward Juancho Hernangomez, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.  Dunn was recently acquired alongside Bruno Fernando in a three-team deal that sent Tristan Thompson from Boston to Sacramento. Despite his durability issues, the Dunn’s defensive versatility potentially served as a nice addition to Ime Udoka’s roster. The crowded backcourt, however, likely would have made minutes hard to come by for Dunn as well as Edwards, who has not panned into the player Boston envisioned when it drafted him in 2019. The Purdue product played 68 games over his two seasons in Boston, averaging 3.6 points on just 30.2% shooting from deep. This move helps the Celtics’ roster crunch with less than one month until training camp, bringing their player total down to 15. Slimming down the backcourt depth chart was inevitable, but adding Hernangomez to the frontcourt while doing so is a quality transaction by Stevens. There wasn’t much playing time for Dunn and Edwards, however, Hernangomez should be a useful depth piece for Boston this season.  After getting drafted 15th overall by the Nuggets in the 2016, Hernangomez played three full seasons in Denver before getting traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves during the 2020 campaign. In late August, he was traded alongside Jarrett Culver to Memphis in exchange for Patrick Beverley — now, less than 10 days later, he is on his way to Boston.  Hernangomez is set to make roughly $7 million this season and has a non-guaranteed $7.4 million lined up in 2022-23. That non-guarantee next year allows Boston to keep some flexibility moving forward, something the front office has mentioned quite a bit so far this summer. He had a tough shooting season in 2020-21, posting a 32.7% clip from 3 over 52 games. If he can up his career 3-point rate of 35.1%, he could make a push for some regular minutes on Boston’s roster. Regardless, Hernangomez can space the floor, which is a valuable thing to have coming off the bench.  All-in-all, this is a good deal for Boston. Personally, I’m disappointed that Dunn was moved because of his defensive prowess, but that is just my inability to remove bias as a Providence College alum. The Celtics freed up space in a crowded area of their roster, while simultaneously adding a stretch big with a non-guarantee next year to the roster. Instead of simply dumping salary, Stevens was able to get some value in return, which Boston fans should be happy with. Training camp begins on September 28, and the roster looks more concrete than it did yesterday.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisgrenham/2021/09/03/what-does-juancho-hernangomez-bring-to-the-boston-celtics/,What Does Juancho Hernangomez Bring To The Boston Celtics?
"Kim Kardashian, Sir Philip Green and Kourtney Kardashian in 2012 The long, bleak bankruptcy process of Sir Philip Green’s once mighty Arcadia retail empire is nearing its end. With a deadline set for November and bidding for his former flagship store–the group’s only notable unsold asset–entering its final stage, clarity is emerging about the size of Arcadia’s pensions deficit, and how much is likely to be paid out to Arcadia’s creditors, whose claims total $2.4 billion. One of the key unanswered questions in the process concerns Topshop’s flagship store on Oxford Street in London. With a reported price tag of around $579 million (£420 million), the asset sale would have marked a significant windfall for those overseeing the bankruptcy, except the store’s $425 million mortgage, owed to U.S. private equity firm Apollo Management International, is secured and therefore must be repaid before any other funds are distributed.  However, clarity is just weeks away. A source with knowledge of the bidding process told Forbes that the second round of bids for the property had arrived and they are currently being considered. In July, Apollo’s President & CEO for commercial real estate finance Stuart Rothstein said during an investor call claiming there were “multiple credible offers” on the table for an amount “in excess” of the $425 million owed. The sale of the iconic Topshop building marks the beginning of the end for an insolvency process that began 10 months ago for a business that made the fortune and reputation of Sir Philip Green, one of the most controversial billionaires in British business today. The Topshop Topman LA flagship store opening party at Cecconi's Restaurant on February 13, 2013 In November 2020, it was announced that Philip Green’s “zombie” empire of 400 stores and 13,000 employees, as described by one retail consultant before its collapse, had finally buckled under debt of over $1 billion at the height of a global pandemic. Since then Arcadia’s administrator’s have sold off more than ​​$820 million of assets to help cover the debt, including the sale of famous brands like Topshop, Top Man, Miss Selfridge and HIIT to competing retailer ASOS in February; the sale of the Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis brands to competing retailer Boohoo, also in February; and the sale of Evans to City Chic in December 2020. In April, Green’s team secured $1.7 million (£1.28 million) from a fire sale of office furniture and I.T. equipment. However, the latest progress report published by bankruptcy administrator Teneo still makes for grim reading for many of those owed millions by Philip Green’s failed empire. In the clearest sign yet that Green could yet be embroiled in another public (and political) pension debacle—as he was in 2016, following the collapse of department store BHS—Arcadia’s bankruptcy administrators admit that “[t]he remaining unsecured element of the Pension Trust debt will not be paid in full, dividends will be in line with those paid to other unsecured creditors.” At the part of the process last November, it was revealed that Arcadia owed over $700 million to the pot of retirement savings for Arcadia's former workers. While nearly all of Arcadia’s $255 million (£185 million) in secured pension debt has been repaid, around $452 million (£327.6 million) is not secured and will be repaid as part of Arcadia’s unsecured debt through a dividend at the end of the process. How much will that dividend be? Around 10% of the money owed, administrators estimate: “We anticipate that sufficient funds will be released to enable a distribution to be made to unsecured creditors of c.10p in the £, based on total expected claims of c.£1.8 billion,” Teneo said in their latest progress report. Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Sir Philip Green and Rita Ora Teneo would not comment or offer guidance on the potential size of the pension deficit or offer specifics on how the money raised will be allocated.  The issue could again provoke the ire of U.K. politicians, who voted to strip the tycoon of his knighthood in 2016, after selling BHS for £1 in 2015, the department store promptly collapsed the following year without clearing the chain’s pension deficit. After a public outcry Green was forced to pay $461 million from his own pocket to settle the debt. In September 2019, Green’s political nemesis, former Labour MP Frank Field told Forbes that Green should use his own money to clear the new $700 million deficit at Arcadia, the actual size of which was not known until the bankruptcy. “The truth is, he’s a billionaire on the basis of these companies,” Field said, “and these company's pensioners have the right to some of his billions.” Forbes estimates Philip & Cristina Green to be  worth  $2.4 billion—largely built on a $1.7 billion dividend from Arcadia, which they paid themselves in 2005. At the time, Sir Philip told The Guardian that the dividend stemmed from a seven and a half year loan to Arcadia, and was “not rinky-dinky funny money.” With Green’s career in retail now likely at an end, Brian Burke, managing director at business advisory firm Quantuma, says that Arcadia failed because it was too big to succeed. “In hindsight, the company was too large to move swiftly to react to its increasingly nimble competitors.” However, he adds, for all the bad headlines, “[Green] should be remembered as the man who changed the whole [retail] model and set us on the path to where we are today.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2021/09/03/billionaire-philip-greens-bankrupt-arcadia-empire-facing-24-billion-in-claims-as-500-million-topshop-flagship-store-nears-sale/,Billionaire Philip Green’s Bankrupt Arcadia Empire Facing $2.4 Billion In Claims As $500 Million Topshop Flagship Store Nears Sale
"The Walking Dead: World Beyond The Walking Dead has been a lot better lately, though it’s still pretty hit and miss. Fear The Walking Dead has been downright terrible, relying more and more on gimmicks and melodrama rather than decent storytelling. World Beyond, on the other hand, just got better and better as its first season went on, ending with a crazy twist and a cliffhanger and a really strong season finale. I, for one, am excited to see where the show takes us in its second—and final—season (if only they’d shown such restraint with Fear and ended after Season 3!) The new trailer for World Beyond’s second season is pretty epic, actually, and it definitely has me looking forward to October 3rd when the premiere airs. There’s also a cameo at the end of the trailer that should make Rick Grimes fans happy or, well, at least get their attention.  Check it out: Yep, that’s Jadis—Pollyanna McIntosh—the last character from The Walking Dead to see Rick Grimes alive. She essentially saved his life by having the CRM swoop in and pick him up in one of their helicopters, though it’s possible Daryl and Michonne would have found him in time otherwise. ""I know that the Civic Republic is the last light of the world. My purpose is to create a new era on this planet,"" Jadis says at the end of the trailer, all decked out in CRM black. (Can I just note here how much less ridiculous the CRM troopers look than the Stormtroopers of the Commonwealth?) Jadis is back We may not see Rick Grimes in Season 2, but Jadis’s inclusion is sure to drop some hints and perhaps even whet our appetites for the long-overdue Rick Grimes movies. Indeed, Scott M. Gimple has teased that the show will offer up ""hints of what happened with that fateful helicopter ride"" though whether those hints will be satisfying, or just another Michonne-on-a-boat moment remains to be seen. World Beyond’s season 2 synopsis reads: Season two of The Walking Dead: World Beyond concludes the epic story of Iris (Royale), Hope (Mansour), Elton (Cantu), and Silas (Cumpston) — four friends who journeyed across the country on a mission that transformed everything they knew about themselves and the world. As they face off against the mysterious Civic Republic Military and fight for control of their own destiny, goals will shift, bonds will form and crumble, and innocence will be both lost and found.

"The Wonderbrett flagship is officially open on N. La Brea Ave. in Hollywood.  For one of the most legendary legacy growers in California, Brett Feldman is surprisingly humble — a welcome and inspiring sentiment amid the ongoing corporatization of the cannabis industry.  During a recent phone interview, he had one adamant request for this feature: “I just want to say thank you and give a special shout out to everybody on team Wonderbrett. I get a lot of credit and I’m the one out here talking about what I started. I put my name on it and I’m leading it, but I cannot do this by myself. I didn’t get here by myself either, and I couldn’t have done it without my team. I want them to feel an immense amount of gratitude and support.” Feldman’s namesake cannabis brand, Wonderbrett, is a favorite flower among connoisseur circles and known for its rare genetics, exotic terpene profiles and meticulous cultivation techniques. The company, which has been selling Wonderbrett cannabis to stores across California since 2012, finally opened its first storefront in Hollywood in July and celebrated with a star-studded grand opening.  In 2019, Wonderbrett was among the thousands of businesses to apply for a coveted social equity retail license from the City of Los Angeles Department of Cannabis Regulation and was ultimately selected in 2020. Today, Wonderbrett is among the 19 special recipients to officially open the doors for inclusive cannabis retail in Los Angeles.  Justin Bieber does in fact get his weed from California (pictured here with Wonderbrett namesake ... [+] Brett Feldman).  But Feldman’s foray into cannabis began long before legalization was on the horizon. He started cultivating in 1998 in the San Fernando Valley where he grew up and a few years later, in the earliest aughts, visited a medical dispensary in San Francisco and glimpsed his destiny  “Man, it's such a confusing thing honestly, because your mind is so programmed in one way for so many years — my mind is still programmed to keep [cannabis] out of sight. Even today with the brand and store, there’s a split personality within me that's highly paranoid about growing and selling cannabis,” Feldman reflected. “I have to remind myself all the time that I have a license to do this.” The reason for having that license? An arrest for cannabis possession with the intent to distribute in the early 2000s — a permanent mark on his record that would ultimately qualify Feldman for to apply to the Social Equity Program, whose mission is “to promote equitable ownership and employment opportunities in the cannabis industry in order to decrease disparities in life outcomes for marginalized communities, and to address the disproportionate impacts of the War on Drugs in those communities.” Wonderbrett co-founders Brett Feldman (L) and Cameron Damwijk (R) with Snoop Dogg at the Wonderbrett ... [+] grand opening on July 8, 2021 in Hollywood. After official acceptance, Feldman, with his childhood friend and Wonderbrett co-founder Cameron Damwijk, readied for retail and partnered with Los Angeles restaurant and nightlife impresarios David Judaken and Mark Tung. In 2017, Judaken and Tung formed Walnut LLC, a large-scale cultivation company in Long Beach. When Feldman and Damwijk were seeking out a cultivation partner, they officially joined forces as collective co-owners.   “They wanted something local. We had a meeting of the minds and we vibed off of each other. I found Brett and Cameron uniquely different than many other cultivators,” shared Judaken. “The industry recognized [Wonderbrett] as what was the first flower ‘brand’ — certainly in California — to put themselves in a branded box that was out in the market prior to legalization. Brett was the go-to guy for many recording artists and became a superhero in those circles, which is how the brand name was originally conceived.” With the flagship already exceeding expectations — Judaken says they’re “seeing sales numbers that other stores take a year to two years to develop” and according to Headset, the brand has generated more than $37 million in sales since adult-use cannabis was legalized in California — let’s take a tour through the wonderful world of weed that is Wonderbrett.  Existing vaulted skylights were refined as part of the Wonderbrett build-out. “Three skylights are part of the old history of this building. We refined them during the build-out and they work amazingly well to saturate the floor with natural light. We essentially don’t even need to turn the [regular] lights on until the early evening, which is pretty incredible. Our offices are also upstairs in an 800-square-foot mezzanine that overlooks the whole store — we’re literally able to look out onto the sales floor and see how our staff is performing and customers are interacting with products versus reviewing video surveillance.” —David Judaken, co-owner, Wonderbrett Team Wonderbrett's main design mission was to provide a comforting aesthetic.  “Our vision [for the store] was clean and classy to match the brand. We wanted a comforting aesthetic, which I believe David did an amazing job [Judaken took the lead on the design project] with all of the woods and the natural light. It's a place where you don't feel like you're in a rush to get in and out, and that's what we wanted. I know, that's contrary to all business strategy — other people are like, ‘How do we get 1,000 people a day into the store?’ — but, I'd rather have 400 people have a great experience and have that spread by word of mouth. That's where our strength has always been. I never want someone to walk into that store and say, ‘Man, I had to wait 20 minutes and [the staff] didn't know what they were talking about.’ It's just embarrassing if I hear something like that. I take it all so personally. I read every single comment. I know I shouldn't. Seeing what the haters say is not healthy.” —Brett Feldman, co-owner, Wonderbrett Wonderbrett cannabis is best known for rare genetics, exotic terpene profiles and meticulous ... [+] cultivation techniques. “I've spent more than half of my life collecting genetics to share with the world. We’re trying to show the masses what good cannabis looks like and not just pumping out brick weed and putting a brand on it. We've been so immersed in this culture for so many years, that we know what we're supposed to be doing and have since day one. What worked then still works now. It's funny because the bigger we get, there are people who are just catching on to us and are like, ‘Oh, I just heard about [Wonderbrett] last month.’ And they think because we're successful and we have nice packaging that we are these corporate guys. No. We’ve all survived the ups and downs for two decades and that’s how we got here. Our cannabis speaks for itself.” —Brett Feldman, co-owner, Wonderbrett  A Wonderbrett partner brand display featuring Papa & Barkley, Mary's Medicinals, Plant Wise, ABX and ... [+] Care by Design.  “We obviously are focused on our own brand, but we need other brands to be successful. We have an extremely curated selection that fits into our store — we can't have it be all Wonderbrett products. It’s not a smart model to say, ‘Oh, this is the Louis Vuitton store and all we sell is Louis Vuitton.’ I really don't think the cannabis market has matured to that level yet — I think that’s still five or even 10 years to get to that place.” —Brett Feldman, co-owner, Wonderbrett  Conceptualized by Wonderbrett co-owner David Judaken, design details include massive wood beams and ... [+] hand-pounded Indian metal light fixtures. “Everything is built from natural materials because I think that communicates the nature of the plant and, most importantly, it creates comfort for our customer. I also like the juxtaposition of old and new. The whole store has contemporary detailing, but that is measured against these old hand-hewn, massive beams and hand-pounded Indian metal light fixtures with Edison bulbs. We planned our oak floors to feel historic — we were not looking to create a pristine environment. And our antique Persian rug gives [the space] a sense of permanence — that it’s always been there.” —David Judaken, co-owner, Wonderbrett Wonderbrett Strawberry Bliss. “When it comes to the flower, we just love breeding new genetics, finding new genetics and bringing them to the marketplace. So, we've built out a big stable of genetics with all of these unique fruit- and gas-based terpenes, and ones that are hybrid with more complex terpenes — all based in flavor. Everything we go for starts with flavor and smokability, then we try to get the THC numbers up as high as we can, which is a big thing right now. All of our new flavors like Strawberry Bliss, Pineapple OG and Beyond Blueberry, we dropped in small batches and [they] are very unique and recognizable when you smoke them.” —Brett Feldman, co-owner, Wonderbrett  Wonderbrett's flower wall includes offerings from Lowell Herb Co. and Glass House Farms to Smarty ... [+] Plants and Dime Bag alongside its own.  “We wanted to include into the opposite of the things that I've personally found an eyesore at other dispensaries as part of the design. Typically, marketing of [outside] brands is a ‘PAD’ area (patient appreciation day). Too often, you see a brand just [go into a cannabis retailer] with a table and a tablecloth — and they do some kind of poster on a stand to promote their products. So we deliberately built stations, or I call them ‘shops in shops’ that are a permanent part of our store. Each space has customizable LED screens behind them, so we can easily rotate the brands we are working with while providing a showcase for their products. This is just one element in our goal of creating a very bright and approachable space with a great energy overall.” —David Judaken, co-owner, Wonderbrett",https://www.forbes.com/sites/katieshapiro/2021/09/03/destination-dispensary-wonderbrett-wows-with-its-first-storefront-in-hollywood/,Destination Dispensary: Wonderbrett Wows With Its First Storefront In Hollywood

(Photo by Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) In a complaint filed by CREW president Noah Bookbinder, the watchdog group points to McCarthy’s statement on Tuesday that Republicans, if they retake Congress, “will not forget” if the companies comply, vowing to hold them “fully accountable under the law.” It also highlights Greene stating in a Fox News interview, “If they go along with this, they will be shut down,” suggesting both comments violate House rules requiring members to “behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.” Greene and McCarthy’s comments came in response to the Jan. 6 select committee’s order to 35 companies asking them to preserve call records and other data of Capitol riot defendants and others who collaborated on efforts to overturn the election. The CREW complaint argues that the comments amount to “threatening retaliation for complying with legally valid document demands” and “obstructing congressional investigations,” which, it adds, “does not reflect credibly on the House.” Forbes has reached out to spokespeople for McCarthy and Greene for comment. The committee is casting a wide investigatory net that covers not only the Capitol riot, but election misinformation and former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. In addition to the request to telecom firms, the panel has sent records requests to eight federal agencies and 15 social media companies, all of which could target some GOP lawmakers. “Telecommunications companies and data providers better not play games with these Democrats, because in 2022 Republicans are taking back the House and we will hold these companies responsible. They will be held to the highest level of the federal law, so they better cross this line,” Greene told Forbes in a statement, adding, “ They better not hand over our personal private cell phone data for the Democrats’ witch hunt 2.0.” 11. That’s the number of House Republicans who signed a letter to 13 telecom companies vowing to “pursue all legal remedies” if they comply with the committee’s records request. The lawmakers, including Greene and Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), added, “Please be advised that the undersigned do not consent to the release of confidential call records or data.” “Blatant obstruction of the House’s ability to investigate this attack on our democracy, if left unaddressed, would gut Congress’s core oversight powers and leave our country still more vulnerable to future attack,” the complaint argues, adding, “This dangerous and unprecedented conduct must not be allowed to stand.” Some House Republicans are trying to punish Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) for serving on the committee, at the appointment of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even after McCarthy withdrew all five of his picks for the panel. More than a dozen members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus sent a letter to McCarthy on Thursday urging him to hold a vote on ousting them from the House Republican conference.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/03/ethics-watchdog-requests-probe-into-kevin-mccarthy-marjorie-taylor-greene-for-threatening-telecom-firms/,"Ethics Watchdog Requests Probe Into Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene For ‘Threatening’ Telecom Firms"

Fortunately, we were able to get it right, keep it going and not fall on our face.” Last year, the league lost one of its biggest sponsors in Adidas as the sportswear brand had to regroup due to financial losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adidas had supplied the jerseys and gear for the players as well as apparel for fans.  Several new sponsors did come aboard, including Microsoft as the official technology partner and jersey patch sponsor of the league. The tech corporation is also the presenting sponsor of the Young3: the league’s youth program. Other notable new sponsors include Verizon, Monster Energy, Zip Recruiter and Taco Bell.  Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles was recapturing the momentum with fans the league had created. After launching in 2017, the league had carved their own space amongst hoops fan, returning some of their favorite former NBA players back to pro-level action. Each year, the league saw growth in players wanting and looking forward to competing and in attracting hoop fans of all ages.  The 2019 season was arguably the league’s best seasons. In his debut Big3 season, seven-time NBA All-Star Joe Johnson took the league by storm, leading in points in setting a league record 175 points for a season. He also led the league in assists and field goals on his way to being named the MVP and helping lead the Triplets to a championship under Coach of the Year and Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie.  Johnson’s game winners and play made him the draw of the league. Each weekend, his highlights would be featured on various sports social channels. At 38, his play even earned him a training camp invite from the Detroit Pistons. He was one of the last cuts but the fact that the NBA was paying attention gave the game further legitimacy. “The focus coming into this year was on regaining awareness, making sure people knew we were back and to remind them of what they liked about the league,” Kwatinetz said. “Successful leagues are so rare. The last one in the last 25 years was the UFC. To recreate the momentum both in the sports community and with fans was very difficult. We couldn’t take anything for granted and we realized we had to do that again.  “The thing we were really making progress on after the third season, and that we needed to recapture, was the sport of FIREBALL3 being a real sport. It’s not dodgeball or kickball. It resembles 3-on-3 basketball but we turned it into a professional sport. We had to reengage with those people and get our fans active again.” CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - AUGUST 07: Ice Cube (L) and Jeff Kwatinetz look on during BIG3 - Week Six at ... [+] Credit Union 1 Arena on August 07, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Jamie Sabau/Getty Images) FIREBALL3 is an innovative new set of rules that sped up the play and created new in-game strategies to further place the league in a lane of its own. The league was opened up to all athletes to try out and the minimum age to qualify was lowered from 27 to 22. A ton of money was also spent on COVID testing to make sure this season wouldn’t be derailed. The changes to the rules and allowing younger players to compete has only increased the level of play and further dispels the notion of the BIG3 as a retirement league. With safety being of serious importance, Orleans Arena in Las Vegas was the host site of this season with stops in Dallas, Milwaukee and Chicago. While Vegas was a great location to get things back rolling for Season 4, Cube is already looking forward to returning to bringing the league to packed arenas across the world. “We want to go around the country and the world and be able to put on games in places you didn’t think you would be able to see pro basketball,” he said. “We don’t want to have home bases and just be in a few locations. This league is built to travel. It’s a rolling All-Star Game if you ask me. In 2019, we went to 18 cities. We would love to break this thing up, play three games each during the weekend.” Business partners and friends for close to 30 years, Cube and Kwatinetz have accomplished some monumental feats in the entertainment industry. The BIG3 has been a true labor of love and both can’t help but to light up when they discuss any facet of it. Cube can’t speak on the league without trying to mention each person, sponsor and partner that has played a role in the league’s success. Kwatinetz says in five years, the goal is for the league to be one of the five biggest in sports and have FIREBALL3 become part of the overall sports culture.  You’ll see both men on Saturday, helping crown a new champion. They will be able to exhale some from what has been a year that tested the foundation of what they have in the BIG3. There will be plenty of smiles shared, but they won’t last for too long. As is the case with any new league — especially one that prides itself on innovation, forward thinking and always looking to grow — there is always work to be done.  “It’s been an amazing ride,” said Cube. “The journey has been one of a kind on a lot of levels. One of the hardest things that I’ve done in the entertainment space. I see why leagues fail now. We’re just blessed to be in a position where we’re trending in the right direction and it looks like we’re going to be here for a long time.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscason/2021/09/03/after-last-years-cancellation-the-big3-rebounds-to-regain-momentum/,"After Last Year’s Cancellation, The BIG3 Rebounds To Regain Momentum"
"Latin American designer talking to a client and watching some design sketches at her atelier - small ... [+] business concepts Any regular reader of this column knows that Voice of the Customer (VoC) is one of many crucial data points needed by consumer-facing companies to survive today. Without it, product development and marketing teams will continue to repeat the same mistakes over and over, wasting time and money, through emotionally based gut decision making.  Data-driven product development decisions create more engaged customers. The most advanced way of ensuring that consumers will purchase the products you’re making is by uniting Voice of the Customer analytics technologies with 3D Digital Product Creation (DPC). Leveraging both of these functionalities together maximizes investment, value and ROI, while helping brands and retailers to stay competitive in today’s rapidly evolving landscape.  VoC can and should be employed at any stage of product development, with or without DPC. However, more mature companies that introduce high-fidelity 3D models into the VoC process reap the most significant benefits. On a “good, better, best” scale, using product photos at the end of sample development in leveraging VoC is a good way to help merchants make smart decisions on product selection and pricing. A better option is leveraging sketches and artwork earlier in the customer process to give directional design feedback. The best possible way of working is to capture VoC at the concept stage by testing 3D assets. Customers can then fully understand how the product will look and product teams will be given multiple opportunities to iterate based on highly valuable customer feedback. Testing 3D assets early in the process diminishes risk as well as sample creation expenses, since only the final “customer approved” versions would then be put into the sample creation pipeline. Significant results in marrying VoC with DPC have been driven by companies including Wolverine Worldwide, Kohl’s 
  
  KSS 
 , and Marks & Spencer.  Lindsey Goodman, Director of Consumer Insights at Wolverine Worldwide, state that the company has the potential to shorten its product development calendar by at least 40 percent and to reduce physical sample creation by up to 70 percent by leveraging customer-driven analytics and digital style testing. Dan Plas, Senior Vice President—Digital & Ecommerce at Kohl’s, stated that wholesale partners who can embed a higher level of certainty into their products enjoy the added benefit of providing retail partners with a much higher level of confidence in the product selection. Kohl’s, one of the best examples of consumer-led retailers, consistently strives to find better ways to service the customer while leaning into predictive analytics and digital product testing to allow merchant teams to be more proactive. Marks & Spencer saw a dramatic increase in conversion when they transitioned to VoC testing using 3D images instead of the more traditional 2D CADS. The London-based multinational retailer has achieved a 12 percent higher sell-through on tested products versus untested products while also collecting 50 percent more customer comments, providing more actionable feedback to its development teams. The benefits of VoC and DPC to consumer engagement and conversion are myriad. The best way to get started is to understand the potential impact and benefits these processes can generate together. Considering where your company stands at the moment, then mapping out key milestones to get to the ideal state is the first step. An overall product development process will help your company scale and track efforts cross-functionally and throughout the business. Utilizing holistic, cross-functional collaboration that considers the aspirations and needs of all stakeholders will create the right environment for a successful transformation.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2021/09/03/better-together-voice-of-the-customer-and-3d-digital-product-creation/,Better Together: Voice Of The Customer And 3D Digital Product Creation
"Ricko DeWilde is one of the individuals featured on Nat Geo's ""Life Below Zero."" The highs here in Houston are still in the 90s most days, so it’s hard for me to imagine temperatures below freezing—never mind below zero. I’m from Detroit, so I am actually envious of people who get to experience seasons other than sweltering. But I don’t know how well I would do if it was just freezing all the time—sort of Houston in reverse. I get to experience it vicariously, though, with Nat Geo’s “Life Below Zero” series. In case you’re not familiar, the show—and its spinoffs—chronicle the lives of people living off the grid in the wilderness of Alaska. While Alaska is a beautiful state, it is also a formidable one—especially for those trying to survive in the middle of nowhere. Weather and wildlife pose a clear and present danger if you don’t have the knowledge and skills to handle it.  The next season premiers on Monday, September 6. I have had the opportunity to watch the first few episodes, and I spoke with Ricko DeWilde—one of the individuals featured on “Life Below Zero.”  I don’t want to spoil what happens, but there is a situation in the first episode that takes some quick thinking and requires having the knowledge and being prepared with the right tools to address it. I asked him about how he obtained the knowledge he has—and that he is now passing down to his own children—and where he acquired the skills to survive life in the Alaskan wilderness.  Ricko is native American—born and raised in Alaska. He is one of 14 children and he did not attend public school until his senior year of high school. He is an Athabascan hunter and trapper who grew up learning the knowledge and skills from his father, who learned it from his father.  He considers it his duty to pass on the same knowledge and skills to his children. He told me that his kids go to school, and they know that the world is changing—they are not completely unaware of modern technology or conveniences. It is important, though, to carry on tradition and pass on cultural heritage.  He told me that he has an advantage over his ancestors in that he has access to much better tools. He has snow machines for transportation instead of just snowshoes, and he has rifles and chainsaws rather than knives and axes. The tools help him, and his family maintain their home and stay prepared and safe. I asked him what is the most challenging. He talked about wildlife—specifically grizzly bears—but he stressed that the weather is a much more serious adversary. You can’t bargain with or outsmart the weather. Ricko explained that the temperatures can go from 30 degrees above zero to 20 degrees below zero in the same day, and that if you are not prepared for any and all conditions you may be caught off guard—which can be a deadly mistake.   Ricko summed up with, “You always have to respect Mother Earth. In the end, she will always win.” I also spoke with showrunner and executive produce Joseph Litzinger about the challenges of filming the show. You may not be aware, but most modern cameras and video equipment are not engineered to work properly in such extreme conditions—never mind the human beings who have to run them. For this upcoming season, the crew also had to deal with the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic.  He told me that the crew have to be prepared to survive almost as much as the individuals they are filming. They may have a few more luxuries or conveniences, but they aren’t staying in 5-star hotels. They are out there, living in tents and sheds and cabins right alongside the subjects they are working with. And they are facing the same weather and wildlife challenges—but while carrying an extra 30 to 50 pounds of equipment and trying to capture the perfect shot.  The crew uses aerial drones and GoPro cameras to capture various angles and allow them to get perspectives they can’t get with standard cameras. They often run into challenges with power. Batteries drain faster and do not retain their charge in extreme cold. The crew will sometimes tape battery packs to their bodies to keep them warm with their body heat so they are ready to go when needed.  I suggested that they might want to consider a spinoff that focuses on the crew. They could have the crew out there filming the subjects for “Life Below Zero,” and a second crew filming a reality series of the first crew to document what it’s like trying to survive the same conditions while filming at the same time—and what it takes to ensure the technology works in those extremes.  Filming was shut down briefly when all travel was halted at the beginning of the pandemic. He explained that once they were able to go to Alaska again, the crew followed strict quarantining and Covid-19 protocols. They also adapted how they film, though—staying out in the Alaskan wilderness for 3 months at a time and recording 11 episodes in a row to maximize the production value of each trip.  Litzinger told me that they tried to go deeper into the characters this season. Every season and situation is different, but after multiple seasons he also wants to bring unique perspectives for the audience. This season they scaled back on the voiceover narration and opted to go with a refreshed documentary style that focuses on the individual subjects. The audience hears from them firsthand rather than having information shared by a narrator.  Previous seasons are available on Disney+ if you want to catch up. The new season of “Life Below Zero” premiers Monday, September 6 at 8pm Easter / 7pm Central.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2021/09/03/its-not-easy-filming-life-below-zero/,It’s Not Easy Filming ‘Life Below Zero’
"School crossing guards and making sure self-driving cars are up-to-speed on what to do. A video went viral that showcased a school crossing guard heroically saving a child from crossing into the path of an oncoming car.  The mother of the child was standing across the street and watched in abject horror when her offspring began to dart forward and appeared completely unaware of the impending danger. With quick reflexes, the crossing guard waved his arm to block the child from further crossing, letting the car then skirt forward and go past the two of them.  Mother and child were then reunited, and the school crossing guard was hailed as a hero. What do you call this? Answer: Just another day in the life of a school crossing guard. You see, being a school crossing guard is pretty much a sacred duty and filled daily with these kinds of rescues and heroic acts.  It is all quite a big deal when you think about it. A school crossing guard is entrusted to help guide young school children across the street. This act includes getting cars to come to a stop, thus letting the boisterous and joyful kids safely skip and hop their way over to the other side of the street, blissfully so. Keep in mind that a car is a multi-ton vehicle that can readily overpower any human, young or old, and readily smack into and harm anyone within its path. Drivers of cars have at their hands the ability to knock people over, and yet drivers oftentimes treat the driving task carelessly, chatting while on their cellphone, watching cat videos, or pruning themselves for the day ahead. The only means a crossing guard has to compel or more like persuade cars to come to a halt is a sign they are carrying and for which it says something akin to stop or halt.  You prominently hold-up the sign, usually made visible by being mounted on the end of a long stick, and presumably, the drivers of nearby cars will see and obey the signage. That’s the hope. That’s the dreamy notion that is supposed to work, presumably all of the time and without fail. To garner additional attention, some crossing guards also wave their other arm or do a bit of a dance to be noticeable. They might also whistle or yell out to the drivers. Most crossing guards also wear some form of garb that makes them stand out, such as bright red colors and reflective strips or shiny buttons.  Of course, the crossing guard might enter into the street to make things plainly clear that it is time for cars to come to a halt. When standing up on the curb, it seems that some drivers perceive the waving of the sign as merely a warning and do not strictly believe they need to come to a stop. Only until the crossing guard is firmly implanted into the street will such drivers begin to believe that the crossing guard is really serious about wanting to have traffic come to a halt. Even after moving into the street, this still might not be a sufficient indication for some stubborn or wanton drivers in their strident driving efforts and so they treat the crossing guard as an obstruction to maneuver around. Yes, that’s right, some drivers seem to think that the crossing guard is merely a kind of statue or object that perchance is in the way of driving. If you can get behind the crossing guard or pass in front of the passing guard, that’s perfectly fine (in the minds of these flighty drivers), as long as you don’t directly strike the crossing guard you are okay to proceed. According to stats published by the NJLM, the accident rate for school crossing guards has sadly and dangerously increased by about 65% over the last decade or so. Yikes! That takes us back to the earlier point about the revered duty of a school crossing guard. Not only are they trying to save the lives of children, but they are also putting their own lives at risk too.  You probably are shocked to think that school crossing guards ever get run down or smacked by a car, since you would never imagine hitting one, but regrettably, some drivers do this dastardly act. Some drivers do so by happenstance, in the sense that they didn’t see the crossing guard and therefore plowed into the person without realizing what they were doing. Other drivers are more intentional, playing a kind of game with the crossing guard. Do you remember the game of chicken that you might have played when you were young? You stare blankly at someone else. They are staring at you too. Whichever one of you looks away or maybe blinks first is the loser of the game. As a form of child’s play, this is simple enough and usually a safe thing to do. The same game of chicken can occur between a crossing guard and a driver of a car that is trying to shove its ways forward and disobey the crossing guard.  The crossing guard is waving frantically to get the car to stop. The driver is staring at the crossing guard and essentially mouthing that the interloper had better get out of the way. In this one-on-one battle, neither side wants to back down. Of course, the car and the driver are heavily favored since a human being is not able to singlehandedly physically stop a car (only superheroes in the comic books can do that). Here’s a curious and mind-bending facet about school crossings that dovetails into the matter of crossing guards and the potential for injuries or fatalities of these vaunted guardians. The percentage of children that walk or bike to school has dropped precipitously from when we were youngsters. Reportedly per the NJLM, about 50% of kids used to walk or bike (that was thirty years ago), and now only around 15% do so.  Why care about this stat? Your first thought is that this means a lot fewer kids are trying to cross the street. If there are a lot fewer kids seeking to cross the street, this would seem to suggest that the odds of any one of them getting struck by a passing car is lessened. Apparently, that is not quite the case, and in fact, the opposite seems to be occurring. The missing factor is to include into your mental equation the vast numbers of kids that aren’t walking or biking are being driven to school. Those children have to get to school somehow. They are being driven. This means more drivers and more cars are converging upon a school during the most active moments when children would be crossing the street.  More cars mean more chances for a crossing child to get hit (i.e., more cars per capita of children crossing). Children are in a bizarre sense the proverbial sitting duck for all those maddeningly wayward-driven cars. You betcha that those drivers are undoubtedly in a frenetic mode. You’ve certainly seen this if you’ve ever driven nearby a school when it is opening in the morning or when the kids are being let out of school in the afternoon. These are crazed drivers. They weave into the traffic without much thought. Their focus is getting their kid, and being overly concerned about other children is not on their list of things to care about. It is a dog-eat-dog world, and this is the time to be a fighter. The cars are in a fierce battle with each other. The kids on the street and the sidewalks are merely window dressing for the real head-to-head struggle that is taking place among the amazing machines called cars. One car driver notices that another driver has pulled ahead. That’s not right! So, the offended driver tries to jam into the line of cars. Sure, there might be children walking all around these vehicles, but that’s not important. What is important is ensuring the pecking order of the cars. Into this ferocious morass steps the school crossing guard. It would be like putting yourself into the midst of a herd of elephants, seemingly angry and rampaging elephants. Do you have an elephant gun to try and stop them? No, you have a thin stick with a shiny sign on the top of it. Not especially empowering. Human drivers will decide for themselves whether they want to abide by the crossing guard or not. Very few crossing guards have any kind of policing capability per se.  They often are not legally empowered to issue tickets. They cannot bolster their actions by indicating that they have the full force of the law standing with them. Some drivers take a dim view of crossing guards for this very same reason. If the crossing guard is not an official arm of the law, this implies that the crossing guard is simply an optional roadway indicator and not someone or something of a mandatory requirement. Many drivers are unaware that their state driver licensing code usually contains a provision that you are required to abide by the actions of a formal crossing guard. In theory, if you disobey a properly conveyed instruction about your driving action, you could be subject to getting a ticket and potentially losing your driver’s license. This is an aspect that few drivers take into account and summarily do not know or patently don’t believe is enforceable. These same drivers would likely obey a stop sign at an intersection.  But the stop sign being held aloft by the crossing guard is given short shrift in comparison. This is why sometimes a crossing guard will wear an outlandish outfit, hopeful that maybe the mirth of the outfit will shock such drivers into a willingness to play along. If those drivers won’t accede to a normally attired crossing guard, perhaps one wearing oddball clothing will garner their attention and make them think twice about disobeying the instructions being issued. Perhaps one of the biggest kickers to this whole situation is that many school crossing guards are not getting paid a dime.  In other words, they are out there trying to protect our children on a pure volunteer basis, meanwhile putting themselves at grave risk, and yet they do so solely for the heartwarming reason of helping others and not due to the pay involved. To clarify, even those getting paid are also equally performing an uplifting duty. The pay involved is oftentimes minuscule and only amounts to a few hours of work per day and thus not much-accumulated earnings during a school year. You can take a look at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website at section 33-9091 on the topic of occupational employment and wages of crossing guards if you’d like to see a breakdown on the annual pay and hours of crossing guards. By the way, though the focus herein has been school crossing guards, please note that there are lots of other crossing guards that daily aid in stopping cars and letting people cross the street. There are crossing guards at downtown intersections, and construction sites, and the mall, and so on. Note too that all these crossing guards are not just protecting children, they also help protect adult pedestrians too.  I’m sure that some adults are insulted at the notion of a crossing guard trying to protect them.  Shouldn’t all adults be responsible enough on their own to know when to cross the street? This same kind of thinking will often surface when an adult is wanting to urgently cross the street and believes that the judgment of the crossing guard is wrong or overly delayed. The viewpoint seems to be that the crossing guard might be for those other “idiots” waiting to cross, but not for those that are of their own mind and can make their own darned judgments. Returning to the discussion on school crossing guards, it was noted that more cars than ever are congregating into a tight space-time continuum when it comes to arriving at a school for picking up or dropping off their kids. This makes the school crossing guard role even more vital, and more harried, and riskier. Keep your eye on the cars, that’s the crux of the entire matter.  If there were no cars, there would by-and-large be no worry about children crossing the street (one supposes that bikes and other threats might persist, though this would be less menacing overall than cars). Until we all have jetpacks, you might as well assume that cars will prevail. Of course, the hope would be that mass transit might be used in place of cars, but that’s a different discussion for another day (see my coverage at this link here). Assume that cars are here to stay. The future of cars includes the advent of self-driving cars. These are cars that are being driven by an AI driving system and not being driven by a human driver.  Here’s the intriguing question to consider: Will self-driving cars do a better job of abiding by school crossing guards and are school crossing guards going to be better off by the emergence of self-driving cars? Let’s unpack the matter and see. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.  These driverless vehicles are considered a Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.  Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.  You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. Self-Driving Cars And Crossing Guards For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. A touted benefit of AI driving systems is that they won’t be driving while drunk, and they won’t be watching cat videos or otherwise distracted while driving. As such, the current and heartwrenching statistic that there are about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities annually in the U.S. and around 2.5 million related injuries is predicted to drop tremendously (for more on these stats, see the link here).  Some assert that the number of fatalities will reach zero. I’ve repeatedly exhorted that there is a zero chance of reaching zero. The physics belie the likelihood of achieving a zero count of fatalities.  Here’s what I mean. A child is standing between two parked cars. The child cannot be seen and is essentially hidden from view by the large-sized parked automobiles. A self-driving car is coming down the street at the posted speed limit of say 35 miles per hour. Suddenly, the child darts into the street, directly in front of the self-driving car. The distance between the self-driving car and the child is now about 10 feet.  Let’s assume that the self-driving car instantaneously detects the child, and the AI driving system immediately jams on the brakes. The stopping distance depending upon the situation (weather conditions, type of brakes, etc.), probably is around 50 to 75 feet.  Compute the math, and you’ll realize the child is going to get hit by the self-driving car. My point is that despite all the super-duper tech of a self-driving car, and assuming it is working at peak performance, there are still nonetheless going to be car crashes and there will (sadly) be human deaths and injuries. Put the zero out of your mind and be relieved and eager that we will at least be reducing demonstrably the number of car crashes. The logic on that assumption is that if self-driving cars do not drink and drive, and they aren’t driving while distracted, and if they drive as safely as humans normally do today, this would right away cut out around 30% to 50% of existing car crashes (or more). That’s a lot of saved lives and averted injuries. Back to the topic of the school crossing guards. The expectation is that AI driving systems are going to drive in a strictly legal manner. They will abide stridently by the posted speed limit. They will always come to a full stop at stop signs. They will never run a red light. To the degree feasible, the AI driving systems will be programmed to be the most law-abiding driver that you can envision. Okay, this suggests that the AI driving systems will certainly obey a school crossing guard. If only the world was that easy and straightforward! First, the AI driving system has to detect that a school crossing guard is present. This detection is a lot harder than you might imagine. Humans can easily scan a driving scene and spot a crossing guard. Getting the AI systems to do so, even using the latest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, can be quite challenging. If the school crossing guard is indeed spotted, the next difficulty is trying to figure out what the school crossing guard is doing and what their actions signify. For example, suppose there aren’t any children nearby and thus the crossing guard is standing at the curb, leaning casually somewhat while waiting for kids to arrive. The long pole with the sign is being held in the hand of the crossing guard. The stop indication is clearly visible.  Suppose the sensors of the self-driving car have detected the presence of the crossing guard. The mathematical analysis of the video images show that this is a seemingly bona fide crossing guard, and they are holding a sign, and the sign indicates the word Stop. The AI driving system has been programmed to always obey the school crossing guard. Thus, the self-driving car comes to an immediate stop.  Yay, it has done what we want it to do. But, has it? In this use case, the crossing guard is not trying to stop traffic. They are merely holding the sign gingerly and not attempting to thrust it or proclaim it upon the passing cars.  The AI driving system is going to have a tough time trying to discern when the crossing guard is actively using the sign and desirous of stopping traffic versus when the school crossing guard is waiting for the right moment to do so. Human capabilities at surveying a driving scene, analyzing the elements of the scene, ascertaining the meaning of those elements, and then taking an aligned driving action is a lot more complicated than we give due credit for. Also, a school crossing guard is a potential moving object. And, each crossing guard is unique in the sense that they each look different from each other. Sure, there is a commonality in that they are likely adults, they are likely attired in something that we assume signifies a crossing guard, and they are likely carrying a sign.  All of those factors add further complexity to the matter at hand. Got a novel twist for you. A local sandwich shop is trying to attract customers. They put outside their shop and stationed at the curb a person in a colorful outfit that is holding a sign aloft. The sign says “Stop for Joe’s” and looks akin to a stop sign.  This could easily be mistaken as a crossing guard that is holding a sign to stop traffic.  Humans would be less likely fooled since they would assess the context of the setting, namely, the person is standing near a sandwich shop and we’ve seen this kind of promotional or marketing effort before. When comparing the situation to that of a normal crossing guard, there are apparent mismatches and thus the human would ascertain this is not a crossing guard instance. Getting an AI system to be able to undertake that same kind of calculated contortions is not easy. Also, for clarity, there isn’t any AI that is yet sentient, and we are not going to likely have sentient AI for a long time to come (if ever, some would assert). So don’t be betting on magical sentience to save the day toward achieving robust AI driving systems. Conclusion The assumption that a self-driving car will always abide by a school crossing guard is accurate in the theory of wanting to have that occur, but the practical reality of programming the AI and getting it to do so is much more complex and not readily out-of-the-box viable. In short, this is a hard problem. The automakers and self-driving tech firms are working on coping with school crossing guards, but it is pretty much still a nascent capability and subject to faltering and not doing what you would hope would occur. Some AI developers have put this onto an edge or corner case list, meaning that it is something they will get done at a later time, but it isn’t a particularly high priority right now.  Getting the AI to do the everyday driving, safely so, consumes their attention right now.  One could argue that perhaps it is rare to come upon a school crossing guard. You have to be driving nearby to a school, usually, and you have to be driving at a time of day that a school crossing guard would be on duty. Yet, for any daily commute or even driving to the grocery store, this seems a lot higher odds than one might initially assume. Furthermore, the importance of the school crossing guard cannot be understated, for which if they aren’t properly detected and aren’t obeyed, puts children at heightened risk. Those developing and fielding self-driving cars need to keep their nose to the grind and continue to improve and enhance the AI-based capabilities coping with school crossing guards.  There is also the upcoming hope that via the widespread adoption of V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian) electronic communications, a school crossing guard could via their smartphone inform the AI about what to do. That will be advantageous, but even this electronic wizardry is insufficient in that the AI still ought to be able to gauge the school crossing guard, just in case the person is not equipped with a smartphone or otherwise unable to communicate electronically with the vehicle. It takes two to tango, and in the case of self-driving cars and school crossing guards, they will need to coordinate and act in unison, ensuring that those precious and precocious children are able to safely get across the street. The next time that you see a school crossing guard, I hope that you will think about all that they do to protect all of us. I’m sure that if AI does become sentient, it would tell those school crossing guards a hearty thank you for their heroic efforts.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2021/09/03/self-driving-cars-doing-the-tango-with-those-heroic-school-crossing-guards/,Self-Driving Cars Doing The Tango With Those Heroic School Crossing Guards
"Zales interior Since 2018, Signet Jewelers 
  
  SIG 
 , the nation’s largest jeweler including Kay, Zales, Jared and Piercing Pagoda, has undergone a radical transformation. Initially guided by a transformation plan called the Path to Brilliance plan, the company created a new chapter called Inspiring Brilliance at the end of fiscal 2021 to keep the momentum going.  Brilliance is an apt moniker for a jewelry company strategic plan, given the high refractive index of a diamond that makes it sparkle. On its brilliance journey, the company has reported continued improvement, even in the worst circumstances during the pandemic year. But in its second-quarter fiscal 2022 ending July 31, it reached a new milestone.  Signet is not just reflecting light. It is radiating light from within. And CEO Gina Drosos was glowing as she reported her company’s results. Shares of the company’s stock on the NYSE ended the day on a 12-month high at $85.26.  Signet revenues reached $1.8 billion, doubling that from same quarter last year. But even more impressive sales were up 31% over same quarter in 2019.  Same-store sales took an even bigger leap, rising 38% over two years ago. This despite having 450 fewer stores, a 16% reduction. Rapidly-growing e-commerce sales more than filled the gap, rising 25% over the same period last year when many of its stores were closed and more than doubled from two years ago. Drosos explained the Inspiring Brilliance plan “is built on four where-to-play strategies: winning in our biggest businesses, accelerating services, expanding accessible luxury and value, and leading in digital commerce.”  And she added, “If winning in our biggest businesses is our foundation, then leading in connected commerce is our accelerator. The two together combined with services and mid-market expansion are multipliers.”  Given this quarter’s strong performance, Drosos also announced, “We are raising our guidance for the year, reflecting our business strength and confidence in our growth strategy.”  Despite potentially troubling headwinds given the uncertainties through the end of the year, Signet is projecting it will end fiscal 2022 with sales in the $6.8 to $6.95 billion range, up from $6.5 to $6.65 billion previously projected. All retailers, but most especially ones like Signet that depend on discretionary spending, are challenged by rising prices, short supply of in-demand products and the threat of the Delta variant as the holiday season approaches.  Drosos tells me all of these unknowns are baked into the company’s latest guidance. Jewelry has been hard-hit by inflation, rising 10.1% in the past twelve months through July 2021. From an internal cost perspective, Drosos says the company is well positioned to absorb rising costs thanks to cost savings and its working capital management.  “Our cash flows have been significant and our cash position is very healthy, which gives us a lot of agility to weather macroeconomic changes,” she explains. On the consumer front, she expects some consumers to feel inflation’s pressure as government stimulus wanes and the cost of essentials, like food, gasoline and housing, goes up. But the company’s consumer insights reveal 80% of customers feel they are the same or better off financially since Covid.  “Higher-income consumers are feeling strong financially and will be shopping for jewelry at holiday. Jewelry is a lasting and meaningful gift that holds it value,” she explains.  This is backed up by results seen for Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day, besides Christmas the biggest jewelry gifting holidays. People spent more on those holiday gifts earlier this year with average transaction value up 18% over two years ago. Drosos expects the trend to continue. The company’s reliance on engagement and wedding jewelry also provides a cushion for inflation headwinds with people spending more in the category. “Bridal represents about half of our revenue,” she says, adding that the company’s research indicates some 2.3 million couples plan to get engaged this year, which is up high single-digits compared to the pre-pandemic year.  Signet is already seeing a bridal jewelry boom, with sales of bridal up 25% over two-years ago. “A lot of people begin shopping for engagement rings in October with people getting engaged toward holiday and New Year’s,” she says.  And because more couples are celebrating weddings now after being delayed by the pandemic, she foresees added tailwinds for Signet’s bridal business. “We know that people who are in or attend a wedding are more likely to get engaged. Weddings make you think about who you love,” she adds. The company’s strong e-commerce presentation of bridal jewelry is further assurance that it is positioned to attract the attention of engaged couples. “While couples still predominantly buy bridal in-store, some 30% of couples in 2021 said they bought an engagement ring online, that’s double was it was in 2019,” she says.  Thanks to improved bridal search and online browse functionality, Drosos expects many couples will land on its pages and show up at one of its stores.  “All of our store teams have gotten very comfortable using technology,” Drosos says. “Through their iPads they can access every bit of Signet inventory. So if you walk into Kay, our jewelry consultants can access merchandise from Jared to find what they are looking for. Because of this our closure rates are up double digits versus where they were two years ago. Before, they could only sell what they had in their case.” Being the nation’s largest jewelry retailer puts Signet in the driver’s seat when it comes to getting the supply it needs from its producers. “We’ve seen incremental increases in our shipping costs, but we’ve been able to mitigate that somewhat because of the relationships with our vendors,” she relates. Reporting that about 50% of holiday orders are already in hand, she expects the rest to be delivered as expected. If things unexpectedly go sideways, she says they have the ability to pull forward Valentine’s Day orders to arrive in December.  The backend work the company has been doing in inventory management also provides a cushion for any supply chain glitches. It’s been turning inventory faster, bringing in more productive lines and moving them around if an item might sell better in a different location. The company reports this has resulted in a 40% improvement to inventory turn, along with a reduction in overall inventory levels.  The company’s experience navigating the pandemic has positioned it well for the Delta variant threat. With no massive store closures expected, the company has a robust e-commerce capability, buy-online-pickup-in-store, concierge delivery, ship from store and virtual consulting ready to pick up the slack if customers are fearful of coming into the store. Virtual consulting, in particular, has been a big win for Signet. “Our virtual consultants establish a human connection through these conversations and help drive higher conversion rates.” For example, over 70% of appointments made through virtual consulting at Ernest Jones result in a sale and the average spending is four times what it would be for a walk-in client.  “We continue to believe that blending physical and virtual experiences will be a core customer expectation for fine jewelry and a Signet competitive advantage for years to come,” Drosos says.  While company data suggests that younger unvaccinated consumers aged 18 to 49 years will remain cautious about in-store shopping, the company also doesn’t foresee these customers shifting spending toward travel and experiences either. This will work in the company’s favor, as well. Regarding the safety of its over 20,000 employees, Drosos says the company has not mandated vaccinations. Instead it is providing information through town hall meetings with a major Cleveland healthcare institution to provide real data from medical professionals to help employees make the right personal decision. As a result, she reports the company has higher vaccination rates than the average. Throughout my discussion with Drosos and her earnings call, she kept highlighting data, both insights from consumer studies and findings from the company’s internal data collection. The data really talks to me, as it does for Edward Deming, who famously said, “In God we trust, but all others must bring data.”  In the data department, Signet has it all over its competitors, and it shows. “We’re the largest specialty jewelry retailer in the world. So we have more purchase data, more website data, more traffic data in stores than anyone else in the jewelry category,” she says. “And it’s really making a difference in all parts of our business.” A fundamental strategy for the company’s brilliance transformation was putting the customer first and that meant getting close to the consumer. So the company launched its first ever internal consumer research function. Then it set up a separate data and analytics function. Combining the external and internal data has led the company to make better decisions and to put more distance between it and its competitive set. The benefits flow throughout the organization into marketing, product selection, inventory allocation, cash management and making appropriate investments to grow returns to shareholders. “Our consumer insights and data analytics are impacting many different parts of our business,” she concludes. “They come together so we can lower our underperforming inventory, get newness with highly productive inventory that gets to the customer faster. Our closure rates go up and that all flows to the bottom line. It’s a good news story all around.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/09/03/signet-jewelers-second-quarter-performance-was-more-than-brilliant-it-was-absolutely-radiant/,Signet Jewelers Second Quarter Performance Was More Than Brilliant; It Was Absolutely Radiant
"Fears of widespread, long-term power outages in the city of New Orleans will not be realized, according to a time line released by the electric company Entergy on Friday, with the company claiming the entire city will have power again by Wednesday despite taking a significant hit from Hurricane Ida. A car is seen under rubble on August 30, 2021, after a building was destroyed by Hurricane Ida in ... [+] New Orleans.  More than 900,000 customers are without power in Louisiana, including 87% of New Orleans, according to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Though New Orleans officials never released official estimates for restoration times, some in nearby suburbs—like Kenner—are said to expect outages for three weeks. Along with New Orleans, Entergy’s “preliminary estimate” released Friday says that Kenner and most of the other inner suburbs should have power restored by Wednesday. The Baton Rouge area, which was also hard-hit by the storm, should have power back by Tuesday, Entergy said. “These are general descriptions of Entergy’s local network. Cities and towns within those networks in some cases will see power earlier than those dates,” the company said in a statement. There isn’t a time frame right now for when power will return to Louisiana’s coastal areas, which took the brunt of Ida’s impact when it made landfall on Sunday with 150 mph maximum sustained winds, tying it with Hurricane Laura of last year and the 1856 Last Island hurricane as the most powerful storms ever to hit Louisiana.  Electricity has started trickling back into New Orleans after the city was cut off from all eight of its power sources during Hurricane Ida, which notably destroyed a 400-foot-tall transmission tower to the west of New Orleans. The lack of power has also led to a critical shortage of fuel in the state, as people rush to refuel generators, which have been one of the only reliable power sources after the storm. GasBuddy reported on Thursday that more than 65% of gas stations in both New Orleans and Baton Rouge were completely without fuel. In response to the fuel shortage, President Joe Biden authorized the Energy Department on Thursday to use all tools possible to ease the shortage in Louisiana, which is also being hurt by the shutdown of most Gulf of Mexico oil production over the past week. On Thursday afternoon, the Energy Department announced it would release 1.5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help alleviate the fuel shortage. The New Orleans Saints will open their season against the Green Bay Packers on September 12 in Jacksonville, Florida, instead of New Orleans, even though much of the New Orleans metropolitan area may have power back by that time. The move was announced earlier this week, at a time when power restoration was expected to take much longer.

All Rights Reserved. Well, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review) has already nabbed at least one box office record, namely the biggest Thursday preview/midnight preview gross for a Labor Day weekend release. With Disney opening the next Marvel Cinematic Universe flick in what is usually the slowest holiday weekend of the year, Kevin Feige and friends don’t have to work too hard to set a new milestone for this specific Fri-Mon frame. And, without breaking a sweat, an $8.8 million Thursday gross (with showings starting as early as 6:00 pm) did the trick.  With the Delta variant and climate change-related disasters creating Covid conditions arguably worse for theaters than when F9 and Black Widow opened in late June/early July, that the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed actioner is something of an underdog despite being yet another Marvel Cinematic Universe adventure. The Thursday gross puts it right between F9 ($7.1 million for a $70 million Fri-Sun frame) and Black Widow ($13.2 million for an $80.3 million opening weekend) among the biggest “pandemic-era” preview grosses.  Black Widow was heavily frontloaded on its opening weekend, a factor that was partially (but not entirely) attributable to the film’s availability of Disney+’s “Premier Access” (own it on Disney+ for as long as you subscribe to Disney+ for $30). The film nabbed a $39 million Friday but barely doubled that over the weekend, giving it the most frontloaded-ever MCU debut. Conversely, F9 had a relatively normal (for a Fast & Furious sequel) Fri-Sun debut with a $30 million Friday and a 2.3x weekend multiplier.  In terms of four-day openers of this scale, Pirates of the Caribbean 5 earned $5.5 million on Thursday for a $62.5 million Fri-Sun/$77 million Fri-Mon Memorial Day debut in 2017. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 earned $13.2 million on Thursday for a $153 million Fri-Mon 2007 Memorial Day weekend launch. Quiet Place 2 earned $4.8 million on Thursday for a $47.5 million Fri-Sun/$57 million Fri-Mon 2021 Memorial Day weekend debut. Black Panther earned $25 million on Thursday for a $202 million/$242 million 2018 President’s Day weekend bow, while Deadpool earned $12.7 million on Thursday for a $132 million/$152 million debut on the same weekend in 2016. Just going by these big Fri-Mon openers, Shang-Chi can be as leggy as Black Panther and make it to $85 million over the Fri-Mon frame. That would also be as leggy as (apples and oranges) F9’s Thursday-weekend multiplier. If it ends up as leggy as Deadpool, At World’s End and A Quiet Place part II, then it’ll flirt with a $106 million Labor Day debut, which is perhaps unreasonably optimistic. However, if Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is only as leggy as Black Widow this weekend, it’ll still earn around $53 million over the Fri-Sun frame. That would be, by default, the lowest Fri-Sun MCU debut ever, with the caveat that its four-day total would be right between the Fri-Sun debuts of The Incredible Hulk ($55 million in 2008) and Ant-Man ($58 million in 2015). I generally argue that anyone who sees an anticipated movie over a long weekend likely would have seen it over the conventional Fri-Sun frame if those extra days weren’t in play. So, especially in these circumstances, I’d equate its Fri-Mon holiday launch with a Fri-Sun debut in conventional times. That’s especially true as the movie is pretty damn good, with mostly positive reviews (92% fresh and 7.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes) and strong buzz among those who sampled it last night. Considering there are no new big four-quadrant flicks between now and No Time to Die on October 8, Shang-Chi will have the field to itself (alongside, ironically, Free Guy and Jungle Cruise) among adult-skewing (The Many Saints of Newark, Cry Macho) post-summer fare and horror movies like Candyman, Malignant and Halloween Kills. Shang-Chi may open “low” for MCU, but I’d expect legs closer to Guardians of the Galaxy than Captain America: Civil War.  Oh, and an FYI, Fandango is reporting that the film pulled the second-best pre-sales of the year (behind Black Widow), and the polling of 1,500 moviegoers noted that... 90% are looking forward to Simu Liu’s star turn, 89% are excited to see the first MCU movie led by an Asian and Asian American cast and 88% want to see how the film will continue Marvel’s Phase 4 storyline. None of that is mind-blowing, but the more you know...

"Larry Walker's Gold Glove defense helped writers elect him to the Baseball Hall of Fame. (Photo by ... [+] Jon Soohoo/Getty Images) Larry Walker never thought of himself as a Hall of Famer.  “I’m just an average guy,” he told reporters in a pre-Induction Zoom call Thursday. “I didn’t put myself on a pedestal. My favorite years were the years we made it to the playoffs.”  When he’s inducted Sept. 8, Walker will become the first Canadian position player to reach Cooperstown and the first to represent the Colorado Rockies.  “To be able to join (pitcher) Fergie Jenkins and with (fellow Canadian) Joey Votto coming after he retires, it’s beyond a big thrill to have the Maple Leaf tattooed on my arm when I’m sworn in,” he said.  Walker, elected in his 10th and final season on the writers’ ballot, got an enormous lift from Coors Field, the hitter-friendly park where the Rockies play.  “I chose Colorado because the snow-capped mountains and fresh mountain air reminded me of where I grew up,” said Walker, a native of British Columbia. “But I realize that playing so many games in Coors created a little bit of a black eye.”  Walker won three National League batting titles and an MVP award during his tenure with the Rockies. He also had a .381 career batting average at Coors Field – 100 points higher than his mark in all other parks.  Originally with the Montreal Expos, Walker came to Colorado as a free agent in 1995, the same year Coors Field opened. It was also the first time the team reached the playoffs – a goal that eluded Walker in Montreal.  “The Expos years were the time I learned everything,” said the former softball star. “I came into baseball a little raw. Without the Montreal Expos, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”  A survivor of a devastating knee injury that threatened to end his career before he reached the majors, Walker is more nervous now that he ever was on the diamond.  Three-time NL batting champ Larry Walker will walk into the Baseball Hall of Fame Sept. 8 with the ... [+] Class of 2020. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) “I keep practicing my speech,” he admitted Thursday. “I’m trying to keep it short and simple, to show how grateful I am for this opportunity.” No one helped with the speech, he said.  “I had restless nights where I’d wake up at 3 in the morning to jot down what was going through my head. I keep practicing but I believe I have the final version now. “There are nights I don’t even go to sleep. The butterflies are here and right now there are a lot of them.”  Walker was elected in December 2019 with just over the required 75 per cent of the vote. “I didn’t pay too much attention the first few years,” said the former outfielder, who needed the maximum 10 years on the ballot to win election.  “I’m not a social media guy though I do have a Twitter account. It was fun to see my vote totals going up the last three years, though it was a little nerve-wracking too.”  Walker said his life hasn’t changed since his election swelled the Hall of Fame’s membership to 333.  “It’s weird to hear somebody say something about me on TV and have the words ‘Hall of Famer’ come before my name,” said the former outfielder, who also played for the St. Louis Cardinals.  “And one time a kid asked for my autograph, which I signed, and he gave it back to me and asked me to add ‘HoF 2020' to it.”  As a kid who hoped to be a hockey player, Walker didn’t care that his high school had no baseball team. But he played fast-pitch softball with his father and three brothers in addition to hooking on with some amateur teams. He showed enough that the Expos offered him $1,500.  “I didn’t play a lot of baseball,” he said. “Baseball wasn’t a big thing in British Columbia and games were minimal. As a result, I was a little behind everyone else when I signed. I had to learn from watching others and learning from others.”  Walker learned well, eventually winning five Gold Gloves and winning raves for his rocket-powered throwing arm from right field.  “I was having fun playing baseball and didn’t even consider myself a future major-leaguer,” he recalled. “Life in the minor leagues is not too rewarding. You do your best to survive. I stayed in a house with five other guys and had a basement apartment. Water dripped on my bed.”  An All-Star for the first time in 1992, Walker shared a clubhouse with Tony Fernandez, still upset that Walker had thrown out at first base on a potential base-hit.  “That was a little nerve-wracking,” he said. “It was a nervous time for me. I tried not to say too much, just to take it all in and watch.”  Walker later decoyed Eddie Murray, now a fellow member of the Hall of Fame, by pretending he would catch a drive that eventually fell for a hit. That game, in Montreal, lasted 22 innings as a result.  The soft-spoken former slugger isn’t sure what comes after Cooperstown. But don’t expect him to follow the path taken by former Colorado teammates Walt Weiss and Dante Bichette, who became coaches.  “I don’t think I’m very good at that,” he suggested. “There’s too much talk sometimes. The art of hitting is tough enough. Hitting is more mental than physical anyway.”  Walker will be enshrined at the Clark Sports Center in Cooperstown along with Derek Jeter, Ted Simmons, and the late Marvin Miller.

"Satyanarayana Chava of Laurus Labs in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. India’s pharma sector, which has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, has just minted a new billionaire. Satyanarayana Chava, 60, founder and CEO of the $658 million (revenue) Laurus Labs—an integrated pharma and biotech company which makes everything from pharma ingredients to enzymes and proteins—saw his personal net worth cross $1.1 billion after shares of his company jumped this week. The stock has risen 176% in the past 12 months. Laurus Labs supplies pharma ingredients for drugs to treat HIV, cancer, asthma and diabetes. The company says that one out of three HIV-infected patients in low and middle income countries are taking meds with ingredients supplied by Laurus Labs. It has marquee clients, including some of the world’s big pharma players, who buy pharma intermediates, generics and contract manufacturing research services from Laurus. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the company recorded a 70% uptick in revenue and a 286% surge in net profit to 9.8 billion rupees ($135 million) buoyed by rising demand for pharma ingredients, capacity expansions and greater operational efficiencies. After spending more than two decades in the pharma business, Chava decided to set up his own venture in 2005 at age 44. He founded Laurus in his hometown of Hyderabad as a pharma R&D outfit. He pooled his savings, borrowed money from friends and family and took bank loans to raise the initial capital of 600 million rupees ($14 million). Chava chose the name “Laurus” as a nod to the botanical name for a class of Mediterranean shrubs and trees as well as the Greek tradition of honoring victors with laurel wreaths. “We wanted the company to represent evergreen victory,” says Chava. As for his strategy of starting off with research,“it always has to begin with R&D,” explains Chava, who still spends 25% of his time in labs. “I am a scientist at heart. I am passionate about chemistry.” He is listed as an inventor, along with others, in 145 patents granted to the company. Laurus now has R&D units in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam and the U.S. as well as eight FDA-approved factories in southern India for contract manufacturing and producing active pharma ingredients and intermediaries. Chava is also actively involved with the introduction of new products. “I work on what product we should we go after because that will ultimately decide how well we are doing,” says Chava, who has brought more than 50 products to market in the last 15 years. Chava says he is not enamored by his billionaire status. “For me it’s just one part of life—it’s not the only thing,” he says attributing his down-to-earth approach to his modest upbringing. Chava grew up in the village of Munnaluru on the banks of the river Krishna in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. (His parents still live there). He walked six miles every day to attend school in the neighboring village. Chava discovered his passion for chemistry in college, which led him to a Ph.D. in bioactive marine natural products and his initial career as a university lecturer.  In 1993, he took up his first corporate job as a research assistant with the erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories, a company that was eventually acquired by pharma billionaire Dilip Shanghvi’s Sun Pharmaceuticals. In 1995, he moved to Matrix Labs, a maker of pharma ingredients for HIV drugs, where he worked for the next decade in various divisions, eventually becoming COO. Matrix was taken over by global pharma major Mylan in 2006. Today, Chava says that his goal for 16-year-old Laurus is to retain the company’s entrepreneurial spirit. “We believe we are a startup in our thinking, action and in our speed of execution,” he says. As the company readies itself for expansion, he says the biggest challenge is people. “We have the money; we have the business but the key is in attracting, identifying, training and retaining talent,” he says. Laurus is working with local universities to design courses that are relevant for the industry. When Chava is not mulling over business strategy or experimenting with chemical ingredients, he spends time in the kitchen whipping up his signature preparations: biryani and Indian sweets such as gulab jamun, mysore pak and kheer.  “I think all chemists are good cooks,” he declares. Perhaps not all billionaires. An employee operates a filtration machine inside a laboratory at a Laurus Labs plant in ...

There are oh-so-many ways a season can go wrong, and with the NFL season set to kick off on Thursday, all 32 of the league’s teams are surely trying to fight off the thought that they could be doomed. But we’re not so positive. Here’s a look at how far each team might sink this season, with analysis from Forbes.com’s expert SportsMoney contributors. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Worst-case scenario: The Bills’ faith in a pair of rookies goes unrewarded, Josh Allen falls back to earth, and aging acquisitions fail to make a difference for an ineffective pass rush. Read more on the Bills’ outlook from Forbes contributor Nicholas McGee. Worst-case scenario: Tua Tagovailoa doesn’t take a step forward in Year 2, and the NFL’s 23-ranked offense sinks even lower, letting down a stout defense as the Dolphins miss the playoffs for a fifth straight season. Read more on the Dolphins’ outlook from Forbes contributor Patricia Traina. Worst-case scenario: Reinforcements on the offensive line and in the secondary do little for a team still wondering if rookie quarterback Mac Jones can be Tom Brady’s long-term successor, leaving the Patriots at their lowest point in two decades. Read more on the Patriots’ outlook from Forbes contributor Liam Fox. Worst-case scenario: Zach Wilson sees some of the same “ghosts” that materialized before Sam Darnold’s eyes, the defense’s youth is exposed repeatedly, and the gleam of a new era dulls rapidly. Read more on the Jets’ outlook from Forbes contributor J.P. Pelzman. Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns before a December 2019 game against the Arizona Cardinals. Worst-case scenario: The losses of running backs J.K. Dobbins (to injury) and Mark Ingram (in free agency) are too much for a run-heavy offense, and the Browns and the Steelers surge ahead in a brutal division. Read more on the Ravens’ outlook from Forbes contributor Liam Fox. Worst-case scenario: Joe Burrow’s left knee again buckles under the weight of a defender, or he buckles metaphorically from the pressure of quarterbacking a struggling team.

Worst-case scenario: A patchwork offensive line can’t overcome the early loss of rookie tackle Teven Jenkins, embattled general manager Ryan Pace is shown the door, and the season winds up meaning little beyond the development of Justin Fields. Read more on the Bears’ outlook from Forbes contributor Phil Rogers. Worst-case scenario: New quarterback Jared Goff and new coach Dan Campbell can’t find a fit, and the defense remains porous, extending the Lions’ streak without a playoff win to 30 years. Read more on the Lions’ outlook from Forbes contributor Jack Magruder. Worst-case scenario: Aaron Rodgers, looking ahead to his next home, plays more like he did in 2018 and 2019 than he did in 2020, and the defense takes a step backward under Joe Barry after last year’s surprise showing. Read more on the Packers’ outlook from Forbes contributor Rob Reischel.

"ENFIELD, ENGLAND - AUGUST 31: Players pose with Getir courier at Tottenham Hotspur Training Centre ... [+] on August 31, 2021 in Enfield, England. (Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images) The benefits Tottenham Hotspur get from having a training wear sponsor are obvious. Having someone pay to have their logo on clothing staff and players must already wear is an easy way to bring in revenue. But what does the sponsor get out of it? Well, the company who’ve paid Spurs for that privilege, food delivery service Getir, gave me an exclusive insight into precisely that. The answer is; actually quite a lot. First, there is the media exposure, which is vast. Getir UK general manager Turancan Salur tells me the business calculated this benefit when the Turkish firm embarked on the deal. “We're going to get this exposure every time there's training, a game [or] a post-match [press] conference,” Salur says. “That’s actually a lot of frequency when you look at how long the football season is.  “Even after the football season comes to an end you have training, so it's quite long period of time that we have this exposure. “We’ve looked at those numbers [and] we've quantified the coverage.  “That's definitely one of the big advantages of sports partnerships.” Buying an equivalent amount of time on TV channels around the world, during, for example, the North London Derby would be an astronomical expense. As would the cost of acquiring banner ads on all the UK’s back pages, that a training picture could get. ENFIELD, ENGLAND - AUGUST 31: Spurs players pose in their new training wear at Tottenham Hotspur ... [+] Training Centre in Enfield, England. (Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images) There is also the benefit that suddenly thousands of supporters are wearing jersey’s which are essentially walking billboards for the brand. For a company like Getir, which is trying to establish itself in London, this is especially important. “Everyone's used to having a logo on the [jersey] of their favourite team,” Salur continues.  “When that logo changes you might actually go out and buy a new [one] because every year [there’s a new range].” Having supporters wearing the branding generates a better awareness about the company and fosters a positive association for fans. “The more [people] see it, the more Getir starts to become something that you're familiar with,” he adds.  “Even if you don't use it, you see it in lots of places [that] makes it much easier for you to try the service because it's not something that's unheard of.  “Even if you support another team, when they're playing Tottenham you see the name Getir.” This effect should not be underestimated.  As I’ve discussed before, there’s a reason why campaigners continually argue that gambling sponsorship should be banned, the consistent exposure to brand logos breeds familiarity and acceptability towards the companies involved. That said, the commercial partnerships Premier League soccer clubs sign have changed a great deal. These days some club’s have sponsors it’s almost impossible for domestic fans to connect with.   Flagship shirt sponsorship packages, for example, are often landed by companies that have little to no domestic association with the UK and, for the past few years, there has been a churn of foreign gambling companies swapping one club’s premium advertising slot for another.  In this regard Getir’s goals with Spurs are something of a throwback, it wants to build brand awareness in the UK, although the global coverage is not unwelcome. “We're interested in the entire reach. But obviously, our primary focus is the UK market,” Salur says. “This is where the majority of fans are [and] the vast majority of the effect we expect it to be at a national level.” Turancan Salur, Getir UK General Manager Coronavirus disrupted the sporting schedule significantly and as a consequence meant soccer club’s had to find different ways to appease their commercial partners.  However, it didn’t dull the appetite for deals, according to experts the disruption made it more of a “buyers market.”   This might be reflected in the fact that Getir was approached by several soccer clubs before its deal with Tottenham Hotspur.  “We had a number of clubs reach out to us, but […] we felt that Tottenham was the best fit,” says Salur. The GM explains that the deal struck with Spurs is designed to supplement the company's core marketing activities, rather than be the central tenet. “It wasn't as high priority as let's say, digital marketing or outdoor advertising because those are more classic things that each brand uses.  “But [sports sponsorship was] always something that was on our mind. So when the opportunity presented itself, when we had the talks, we just thought; ‘Well there's a great opportunity here.’” Arsenal players Freddie Ljungberg (left) and Ashley Cole, model the club's new football strip, ...

(Photo by PA Images via Getty Images) Any company that ties itself to a sporting entity with the expectation that it is guaranteed an association with success is foolish. In soccer, like all sports, nothing is given.  But doing the right deal at the right time can bring benefits that transcend the value of any contract. Manchester United supporters surely can’t see the Sharp electronics logo without feeling a stab of emotion from the 1999 treble-winning season and Arsenal fans won’t look at the O2 branding without it stirring memories of its 2004 invincible team. Long after those deals ended these brands still feature in nostalgic media coverage and have their logo worn proudly by supporters at games. The image is an irrefutable element of those historic successes. Having had a somewhat underwhelming season last time around, Tottenham Hotspur currently sits top of the Premier League and, even at this early stage, could be contenders for Champions League qualification. Participation in the Europa Conference League also presents one of the best chances of a continental trophy in a long time. The deal with Spurs could be a coup for Getir if the team deliver some long-awaited success. “We had a great start to the season and if it continues like that, [it’s] all the better for us. “Sporting success definitely accentuates [the benefits for Getir].  “One of the reasons we went for this partnership, is because we think that both currently and in the future Tottenham will do well.” One recent boost was Tottenham Hotspur captain Harry Kane announcing that he will be staying at the club. The news was not only a benefit to Spurs fans but also their commercial partners like Getir.  For a year a least, they can rely on the England captain wearing their logo. So it’s not a surprise Salur welcomed the news. “You want what's best for the club, both in terms of, sporting success, but also in other aspects.  “The club's accomplishment becomes your joy.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakgarnerpurkis/2021/09/03/what-getir-gets-from-being-tottenham-hotspurs-training-wear-sponsor/,What Getir Gets From Being Tottenham Hotspurs’ Training Wear Sponsor

Alaina, 26, releases her third album, 'Sitting Pretty on Top of the World,' today via Mercury Nashville.  Lauren Alaina hasn’t let the pandemic slow her down. The country singer, who was runner-up on Season 10 of American Idol at age 15, continues to expand her brand in 2021 as an artist, actress and author.  Alaina, 26, releases her third album, Sitting Pretty on Top of the World, today via Mercury Nashville. On Saturday, Sept. 11 her film Roadhouse Romance premieres on the Hallmark Channel and on Tuesday, Nov. 23 her book, Getting Good At Being You, debuts. She credits juggling her many ventures to having a strong team around her.  For Alaina though, it is her unwavering faith and passion for music that has kept her going through difficult times. The best business advice she’s learned is don’t ever give up. “If there’s something inside you telling you that you’re supposed to do something, you probably are,” she tells me. After placing second on American Idol, Alaina moved to Nashville. Things didn’t connect immediately for her, and Nashville was expensive for the teenager from Rossville, GA. Times were tough, and she had to make the difficult decision to sell the Shelby Cobra Mustang she won while on American Idol. “I was famous, but I wasn’t successful,” she says of the years following American Idol. “I didn’t have money and in order to survive I had to sell it. It was the hardest decision. I couldn’t make ends meet so I sold that car, but I couldn’t go home. Something in me was like, ‘You can’t go home. You’ve got to stick this out.’”  Around the time she sold her car, Alaina got new management and her manager, Trisha McClanahan, gave her $10,000 and an opportunity with Cracker Barrel. Through her partnership with Cracker Barrel, Alaina received gold meal cards and could eat at the restaurant for free.  “Trisha helped transform my life,” she says. “I started writing and I wrote ‘Road Less Traveled,’ which earned me my first number one song on country radio, and I've kept trucking along. I kept pushing forward and I kept trying to figure out how to make ends meet.” She’d garner another No. 1 song with childhood friend and classmate Kane Brown on his single “What Ifs” and Hardy and Devin Dawson with “One Beer.” She eventually paid her manager back and last year her family tracked down her old Shelby Cobra Mustang and she bought it back as well as a new home. “I've been really fortunate and really blessed,” she adds, “but I had to go through some really hard times of uncertainty to get there. My biggest piece of advice is, if something is telling you it’s meant to be it’s probably meant to be. You're just going to have to be willing to stick it out and see what that is.” Much like her early years in Nashville, Alaina went through some heartbreak ahead of releasing Sitting Pretty on Top of the World. After going through two public breakups, losing her stepfather and learning to adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic, Alaina channeled these events and emotions into the 15-track project. Along the way, she hopes sharing her pain helps others heal.  Title track “On Top of the World” was inspired by a pandemic walk Alaina went on. Upset at what was going on in the world and in turn upset with herself, the line “hitting rock bottom sitting on top of the world” came to her. She took the idea to songwriters Jordan Reynolds and Sasha Sloan, and they transformed the concept into a song about a breakup.  “I had some pretty big life altering events … and I was the girl with the biggest personality, but I've also really struggled with depression,” she says. “The last few years have been a time of discussing mental health more so that's why I named the project that — so I could share that story and then also the title ‘Sitting Pretty on Top of the World’ is just a really empowering title.” Album opener “It Was Me” has Alaina reflecting on a former relationship while admitting her insecurities and the harsh realization, “It wasn’t you I didn’t love/ It was me.” “I was just young, and I wasn't in a place of self-love or loving myself that I could accept love or give it properly,” she says of her first relationship. “I wanted to say that for him. I don't know if he'll ever hear it, but it was such an important thing for me to say and it was so important that it went first because he came first in my story and he's a huge part of who I am to this day.” “It Was Me” begins with the sound of a needle drop on vinyl while album closer “Change My Mind” has the vinyl fade out. Alaina says the album as a collection was important to her, as was reconnecting with herself. Additional highlights include previous single “Getting Good” featuring Alaina’s mentor Trisha Yearwood, who also wrote the foreword to her book, and feel-good single “Getting Over Him” with Jon Pardi, currently No. 36 on the Mediabase country chart. Having written 14 of the album’s 15 tracks, Alaina bestows a little of herself and the lessons she’s learned on each track. “I finally got myself into a place of healing,” she says. “This pandemic is still obviously affecting us all, but because I stopped, I was able to process everything I've been through, and I was able to find a lot of healing through that. I'm really proud of that and I'm proud of this project as a whole. I think it really represents healing and I know that's what we all need. It helped me get there, so hopefully it can help somebody else too.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/anniereuter/2021/09/03/lauren-alaina-finds-herself-on-sitting-pretty-on-top-of-the-world/,Lauren Alaina Finds Herself On ‘Sitting Pretty On Top Of The World’
"14th Avenue East in Seattle has lessons if we're willing to learn them.  More than 12 years ago now I wrote blog posts for a now defunct blog at Seattle’s Daily Journal of Commerce 
  
  DJCO 
 . SeattleScape was subtitled, “Design and Urban Development in the Emerald City.” I discovered an old post titled, “Reading the Scale,” (check out the the archived version of it on Wayback Machine). In Seattle, the discussion about housing changed from one about density and neighborhood scale — quantifiable and tangible — to a debate about the more amorphous “social justice.” My old post was about a street in Seattle that showcased how all sorts of housing could work together in a densely populated neighborhood. Taking a walk down that street today confirms at least that fact hasn’t changed.  As I’ve posted elsewhere, Seattle has had a long history of struggle with growing as a city. Some people, like the late Emmett Watson, championed the notion of “Lesser Seattle,” a sense that Seattle should stay more like Portland. Others, like the late Jim Ellis, pressed for a Seattle that would become a world city like San Francisco. In many ways, the city has always wrestled with its identity, with some wishing Amazon 
  
  AMZN 
  would go away and others longing for more growth and density.  It used to be that “density” was the key word. Sometime in the second decade of the 21st century, the term “social justice” took precedence over everything else in this liberal, left leaning city. What does that term social justice mean? It’s hard to figure that out. Generally, it means a lot of things to a lot of people from defunding the policy department to affirmative action. Somewhere along the line the term density, the number of people per square mile or acre in a city, got swept into social justice as well. As I’ve pointed out, the notion that single-family typology is somehow racist has caught on. I’ve pointed out that is not a useful direction for the debate to have taken.  My post was about 14th Avenue East in Seattle’s Capitol Hill Neighborhood, more specifically, a quarter mile stretch of the street from Volunteer Park at the north to John Street at the south.  Seattle's 14th Avenue East, from Volunteer Park to John Street.  My post was a little bit sarcastic because what I discovered at one end of the tree lined street was series of huge houses, mansions really.  A big house on tree lined 14th Avenue East in Seattle.  Apartments just down the street from mansions.  And as I walked further down the street I found apartment buildings. While these apartments are of modest scale, brick, and even somewhat historic looking, there are still multifamily housing, the kind of housing typically resisted often by single-family neighborhoods wishing to keep their neighborhood “identity.” This was a typical battle line for the housing debate more than a decade ago.  More apartments! My point here was to illustrate not only that typologies can co-exist happily on the same block but that the very diversity in typology was, in fact, what gives 14th its identity. Gigantic homes with lawns and terraces work well with apartment buildings if we just let that happen.  And even more apartments.  But what about economic diversity? Aren’t all the people living on 14th wealthy white people? Sure those are apartments, but they’re probably like apartments on the upper west side of Manhattan: full of maybe not so rich white people, but still pretty well off white people. But hold on a second. A high rise? Yes, that is a high rise apartment building less than a quarter mile away from a mansion near the park. And it isn’t just any high rise; this building is owned and operated by the Seattle Housing Authority. Yes, that much reviled “concentrated poverty” of subsidized public housing.  Is this little strip of Seattle a unicorn? Hardly. Almost any city in America has abundant examples of, well, as Bill Murray put it in Ghostbusters “mass hysteria.”  Yes, dogs and cats living together. Mansions, tree lined avenues leading to a park with a mix of smaller single-family, apartments, and yes, a public housing high rise. Yes, you can put all of those typologies together, create identity, affordability, and yes, you can even have the tree lined streets. Sarcasm, see. Has anything changed? Well, I just walked down 14th Avenue East and no, it’s just about the same except for some new multifamily housing (I think) going in next to that big house.  More new housing on 14th Avenue East.  There they are cats and dogs, lions and lambs all happily living together as they have for many, many decades. No design review. No hysterical meetings. No social justice or inclusionary zoning just a city doing what a city does if it is allowed to. Oh, also, something else that’s new since 2009, right near the public housing, there is microhousing, small apartments (200 square feet) with no kitchens, less than a quarter mile from mansions that probably have more square feet than this entire building.  OMG. Microhousing!  So we don’t need a war on single-family housing to create affordability. We don’t need zoning or really much planning at all. What’s needed is simply for people who need housing to meet those that produce and operate it to meet, make a deal, and get on with their lives. The lesson of 14th Avenue will still be there when the latest planning and “Urbanist” catch phrases, bromides, and buzzwords have faded from use. In a decade you’ll still be able to go there and see lots of housing of all kinds for all sorts of people of all levels of income. In other words, mass hysteria.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2021/09/03/one-streets-abiding-lesson-more-housing-of-all-kinds-for-people-of-all-levels-of-income/,One Street’s Abiding Lesson: More Housing Of All Kinds For People Of All Levels Of Income
" Jalen Rose is the voice of the people with two popular podcasts Jalen and Jacoby and Renaissance ... [+] Man (Photo by Santiago Felipe/Getty Images) Jalen Rose is the voice of the people.  The proud Detroit native (What up doe?) and University of Michigan graduate is one of the most authentic and compelling personalities in entertainment, culture, and sports media. Rose first came to prominence as a member of the iconic Fab Five team at the University of Michigan where the squad went to two consecutive NCAA championship games in 1992 and 1993. Following his college career, he was drafted as the 13th overall pick by the Denver Nuggets in the 1994 NBA draft. In his successful career, he would play for 13 seasons and won the Most Improved Player Award in 2000. Since his retirement in 2007, Rose has worked at ESPN as an analyst on SportsCenter and in 2012 he became one of the hosts for NBA Countdown. In 2011, he produced the ESPN documentary The Fab Five and it became ESPNʼs highest-rated documentary  Of all his achievements, Rose is most proud of his school, The Jalen Rose Leadership Academy (JRLA) which he founded in 2011. The academy is an open enrollment, tuition-free, public charter high school on the Northwest side of Detroit, where he grew up. The academy serves over 400 9th through 12th-grade students with one hundred percent of the academy's graduates have gained college acceptance since the inaugural class graduated in 2015. I caught up with Jalen on a Zoom call and we spoke about why he uses his platforms to be an advocate for athletes, how he got a bust of Jadakiss, and his two popular podcasts Jalen and Jacoby and Renaissance Man.  Grove: It’s an honor to speak with you today. Earlier this year, I covered the incredible work you’re doing at The Jalen Rose Leadership Academy. Rose: Appreciate the love man. We are tuition-free so any coverage and any support we get is major. Thank you very much. Grove: But I wanted to start with this: What do we have to do to get the Fab Five in the Basketball Hall of Fame? Your squad, the Georgetown Hoyas, and the North Carolina Tar Heels with Vince Carter were my favorites. Rose: Well, just so you know, when I was a member of the Pacers, Larry Brown use to have us practice at the University of North Carolina. That was the first time I ever met  Rasheed Wallace and Vince Carter. I cannot make this up. I went to their basketball facility and Rasheed Wallace had on Michigan shorts and Vince Carter had on a Michigan jersey at UNC’s campus! True story. Dean Smith had a picture of me shooting a shot over Bobby Hurley hanging on his wall. They was like, “Dean Smith loves you.” Grove: Here’s something else I want to know. When you and your wife Molly have a sports debate, who wins? Rose: She wins. You know how it is. I met the true executive producer of your show, your wife Brandi. I know she set up that background. I know she's the person who put all the pictures up. All you did was say yes, yes and sit there. I know for a fact.  Grove: You are correct! In the sports realm. whatever platform you’re on, you always advocate for players. Whether it’s during contract negotiations or free agency. Why is that important for you? Rose: Because there are a lot of voices. Some are more predominant than others. Some are more accurate than others. You can disagree with Kevin Durant leaving OKC to join the Warriors but you can't call him names. That crosses the line. One of the many reasons I wanted to get into this industry, as mass communications was my major in college, was that I felt like I wanted to be a voice that was unbiased. I was called a hoodlum and ghetto when I was at Michigan. If there was a list of all the hated collegiate athletes, I'm was going to be on it. I watched all of these things happen and was like, “I'm going to have an opinion and I'm going to say facts.” I wanted to be honest, to represent my people, my neighborhood, and the streets because that's where I grew up playing sports on the blacktop at the park. What I wanted to as a sports analysis, not just as a black man, but also as an educated man who accomplished everything everybody else accomplished that does this job. I have their diploma but I have my voice and my experience. Lastly, I want to kick down barriers. I'm the only former NBA player that has a Monday to Friday show and that's been the case for like 10 years. Why is that? Because what ends up happening is if you look at the landscape of media, football and basketball are predominantly Black and many networks don't want to have an all-Black show. So what happens is that we'll have the former Black player that we can rinse and repeat and treat us like a monolith. While we still have the white play-by-play person as the host. That is the staple of most shows. They just rotate the players. So I'm just here as a vessel to try to break down as many barriers as possible. Grove: When was the first time you met David Jacoby and how did you two come up with the podcast? Rose: The first time I met David was when we were at Stroker’s, an adult entertainment club in Atlanta. By the way, I'm the first former athlete to have a podcast. I was doing podcasts on Periscope before Apple and Spotify. I pitched Bill Simmons an idea at an ESPYS’ after-party that was at the W Hotel in L.A.  I was like, “I'm going to wait until like 2 am to approach him because usually adults that had a couple of glasses of wine will be more apt to least listen to my idea.” I saw that ESPN had a subsidiary called Grantland and I was doing primarily basketball shows. Before that I was on the NFL Network, MTV Movie Awards, I worked for TNT, I'm socially and politically conscious so I didn't want to take 22 minutes to only talk about basketball content. So I pitched Bill the idea of a show called The Rose Report and it really took me like two or three months to actually get the meeting.  One of the things I decided is that I wanted somebody to do the show with me. I like having somebody to bounce things off of. So in the pitch meeting, they asked me did I want to bring in one of my former teammates or somebody from my neighborhood or college. I told them I wanted to do the show with Jacoby because he was in the meeting working right beside Bill at Grantland. He was looking at me like I was crazy and that’s how we started. After a few years, we changed the name to Jalen and Jacoby. We went from a podcast to a radio show, to a late-night TV show to an hour on ESPN 2 to 30 minutes on ESPN. Grove: On Jalen and Jacoby you have so many iconic photos in your background but how did you manage to get a bust of Jadakiss? Rose: I’m just trying to teach people. A large portion of our audience can't hear what we’re saying. They may be in transit, they may be at a restaurant, they may be at the airport, or they may be in and out of the room. But they see us when they look at the TV. Just like the pictures behind you. You chose to sit in that spot for a reason. That's exactly what I did. I put up the Muhammad Ali summit picture, the Ice Cube Doughboy pic, the Jackson Five, and Jane Kennedy. By the way, the OG’s loved when I put that picture up. They was like, “Yo, we rock with you.” I’m glad that people are actually appreciating the greatness of The Lox. I was in the “We Gone Make It” video. I've been to D Block. I'm really fortunate that Styles and Sheek have shouted me out in songs. It was terrific marketing when Jada started saying he was “Top Five Dead or Alive.” Now you can't introduce him or say his name without mentioning that. In doing that promotion, he created his own Hall of Fame bust. Eventually, I told him, “I need that bust for the studio. I know that bust is at your house right now doing nothing and nobody's looking at it. I'm starting to show called Jalen and Jacoby. You know about this show. I want to have you on the show. I need that bust.” So for years, people been seeing it and there’s waves on the bust that we always joke about and people were surprised that I was still having him in the conversation of all-time greats. I wasn't just talking about the Verzuz because I was there. You know who was there with me? David Jacoby. Grove: Not only do you have one the top sports podcasts with Jalen and Jacoby, with Renaissance Man, you have one of the premiere entertainment/culture podcasts. How did you develop that concept? Rose: Everything I do is representative of my hometown. They even gave me the key to the city. So Renaissance Man, comes from a notable building of Detroit called the Renaissance Center. When I use to go there when I was young, they had a restaurant called The Summit on the rooftop that moved really slow in a circle. You can see Canada and we use to go to the movies there. It's our storied building So I named Renaissance Man after that but it's also a play on words to be so very versatile in the game. I was fortunate to have a top-flight podcast in the sports division and I wanted to build a top-flight podcast in the entertainment division. So if you look at my guests, I haven't interviewed a current athlete on the show. But I interviewed people in fashion, travel, current events, wine, I just had Wolfgang Puck on the show. I realized that I have an audience of people that support me and believe in me doing this multimedia thing for a living that I can venture outside of the sports space and have a successful show that has nothing to do with sports. That's what Renaissance Man provided me. I’ve interviewed Magic Johnson, Mark Cuban, Adam Silver, and Tommie Smith but I've also interviewed Katie Couric, Killer Mike, Master P., Bobbi Brown, the legendary makeup aficionado. So it has really given me a chance to broaden my horizons for the audience but also talk to people in a different way. Like I'm interviewing Hit-Boy today. I appreciate the New York Post for believing in my vision of interviewing so many different people from so many various walks of life. I’m really getting them to open up about things that they don't necessarily always talk about. So I guess I am a true renaissance man because when you look at the podcast rankings, I have one in the sports category and I have one in the entertainment category and I'm really fortunate.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashadgrove/2021/09/03/jalen-rose-is-the-voice-of-the-people/,Jalen Rose Is The Voice Of The People
"Mooyah opened its first New York City location in February 2020 and quickly navigated a number of ... [+] COVID-related restrictions. The company's VP of operations believes the city's vaccination mandate will be an even bigger challenge. Mooyah Burgers Fries and Shakes opened its first New York City location near iconic Times Square in February 2020. We all know what happened a month later.  The proliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic upended everything in the restaurant space and, for Mike Sebazco, Mooyah’s vice president of operations, coming up with a pandemic playbook from scratch was no doubt a challenge. But the chain, like most of its peers, shifted its operations to off-premise channels such as curbside, takeout and delivery, and was able to make it through those challenging months. Now, however, he says a potentially bigger challenge looms as New York City prepares to mandate at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccination for restaurant employees and dine-in customers. Enforcement of the new rule begins Sept. 13.  “Not complying is not an option. A mandate is a mandate,” he said. “However, this is a selective mandate and that is what has me upset about it. We want to be on the other side of this pandemic as much as anyone, but I’m hard pressed to think that other municipalities would roll out this particular mandate the way New York has. It’s like curing a headache by tearing off an appendage.”  Sebazco has concerns that as New York goes, other municipalities will follow and, indeed, San Francisco has issued a similar rule, as have other restaurants throughout the country. But his specific grievance isn’t about mandating the vaccination so much as it is New York’s rule specifically, which applies to gyms, performances and restaurants and not, for example, big-box retailers or other businesses.  “The selectiveness disproportionately affects the restaurant industry. If this was a blanket mandate, where grocery stores and other businesses were playing by the same rules, I probably wouldn’t be as upset. Our industry has been picked on,” Sebazco said.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a couple of COVID-19 studies focused specifically on the risks of dining out, in fact. In March, before the vaccine was widely available and some dine-in regulations remained in place, the CDC released a study finding that illnesses and death rates from COVID-19 were spreading faster in jurisdictions that allowed on-site restaurant dining, for example. In September 2020, another CDC report found that dining out increased the risk of contracting COVID-19.  Such risk explains in part why the employee quit rate in the industry is at an all-time high.  These reports, however, don’t answer the growing list of questions about vaccine mandates–for instance, whether children 12 and under, who aren’t yet approved for the vaccine, can dine with their parents. Sebazco is hardly the only one asking such questions. Last month, the Independent Restaurant Owners Association Rescue, which represents about 50 businesses, filed a lawsuit against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for the mandate. The group argues that the rule provides no accommodations for those who can’t get the vaccination and that it doesn’t involve other similar settings with “groups of unassociated people interacting for a substantial period of time,” such as churches and health care facilities.  The New York City Hospitality Alliance also stated that the mandate will pose economic and operational challenges for the industry, though ultimately supports it to avoid further restrictions and shutdown orders.  Those economic and operational challenges are where Sebazco’s biggest concerns come into play. He said Mooyah’s New York City location anticipates losing about 20% of its team at a time when the restaurant is already short staffed. Labor will be even more pressured, he said, with the necessary training and staffing involved for employees tasked with verifying customers’ vaccination status.  “We expect 20% to choose another industry because of this selective mandate. It’s already incredibly difficult to run this business and to further inhibit our ability to do so, whereas other industries don’t have to worry about such rules, that’s a tough pill to swallow,” Sebazco said. “I just want a level playing field and I’m not sure I’ll ever understand why the server who is masked up and following safety protocols has to be vaccinated, but the butcher down the street doesn’t have to be.”  Sebazco also expects about a 20% sales loss to come from the vaccine mandate, which could be a conservative number considering a July report from Datassential found that nearly 30% of diners would leave a restaurant if asked to present proof of their vaccination status.  That said, another study showed the same number of consumers would actually be more likely to dine in a restaurant with a vaccine mandate–perhaps illustrating the complexities of such disparate legislation. It’s early days for these types of mandates and we’re likely to see more put into place across the country. If and when they do, they’ll likely affect other Mooyah locations across its 23-state footprint. Sebazco is updating his operational playbook accordingly, and hoping that level playing field exists beyond New York.  “We’re not opposed to vaccine mandates, but they’ve got to be across the board. We will figure it out because that’s what restaurant people do and that’s what we’ve been doing throughout this pandemic,” Sebazco said. “We’ve had to be chess masters, but this New York mandate is a real head scratcher. We’ll comply–and we take compliance very seriously–but this one’s not going to be easy.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2021/09/03/burger-chain-operator-frustrated-with-nycs-selective-vaccination-mandate-for-restaurants/,Burger Chain Operator Frustrated With NYC’s ‘Selective’ Vaccination Mandate For Restaurants
"The Wilson pop-up museum and store offers one key component of the brand's all-in approach on New ... [+] York City during the U.S. Open.  One of the biggest moments in the tennis calendar comes annually in New York City. So Wilson Tennis decided to go all-in on New York during the U.S. Open, unveiling a range of efforts that span a pop-up museum and store next to the future home of the brand's flagship retail location, a collaboration with streetwear brand Kith that includes rackets, apparel and remaking a NYC tennis court and even the unveiling of the latest iteration of the Blade performance racket franchise.  ""This is a great opportunity to create a rallying point for the whole brand and share with the whole world a stronger, bolder perspective of ourselves,"" says Gordon Devin, president of Wilson Sportswear. ""When you lay it all out, we did take on a lot, but we can't be a one-trick pony.""  The Wilson New York onslaught—including billboards of Stefanos Tsitsipas adorning the city advertising the new Blade—isn't happenstance. Every element was put in motion long ago. The Wilson x Kith collaboration includes rackets, performance gear and lifestyle designs.  ""This has been planned out for a while,"" Devin says. ""We always knew, being a partner for the USTA and on-court at the U.S. Open, this is a major moment for us and that our elite athletes from tennis would be in town. That created the catalyst and then we formed all the other pieces around that.""  A museum portion of the Wilson pop-up on Broadway in New York City brings history to the brand's ... [+] modern look.  The pop-up museum and Wilson Tennis store at 594 Broadway in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan opened before the U.S. Open got its start, welcoming tennis legend Billie Jean King to the kick-off event. The space will run throughout the tournament, next door to the future home of Wilson's flagship retail location.  The pop-up is part museum and part showcase of both performance tennis and the brand's recent foray into tennis-inspired sportswear. From the stories of rackets dating back to 1917 to historic rackets used by the likes of Jimmie McDaniel—Wilson arranged for McDaniel to play Don Budge to break the color barrier in the sport in 1940—Roger Federer and Serena Williams and lessons on materials used in rackets.  Rackets bring just one component to the Wilson pop-up museum and store in New York City.  The museum merges with photo opportunities and invites shoppers to browse the latest from Wilson Sportswear and Kith while integrating performance elements with a ""racket maestro"" for racket customization.  Locating the pop-up next door to the future home of the flagship location was an opportunistic move since the permanent spot has Wilson excited. ""We wanted to be in that part of town,"" Devin says. ""There is an X-factor in the actual space. I can't share too much about it because I don't want to spoil it, but it was driven by the physical environment.""  The Wilson pop-up museum and store is next door to the soon-to-open site of the brand's flagship ... [+] retail location on Broadway in New York City.  While Wilson opened its first retail location in the brand's hometown of Chicago in July, the second store is going to be a ""new retail experience"" and the brand was exploring Chicago, New York and Los Angeles as possible locations. ""We found this space and it felt right,"" Devin says about the New York spot. ""The community is there. There are a lot of eyeballs on New York."" The Wilson x Kith collaboration offers up everything from old-school leather racket covers to ... [+] lifestyle and performance apparel.  Launched Friday, Sept. 3, the Wilson x Kith collaboration covers rackets, balls, accessories and apparel. ""It came from a shared desire as I got to know (Kith founder) Ronnie Fieg to democratize sport,"" Devin says. ""Ronnie loves playing tennis and Kith makes amazing, beautiful products in fashion and they make it relevant, inclusive and appealing to today."" Devin says Wilson has tried to approach sport in that way for 108 years and the two brands wanted to celebrate Wilson's history in tennis and Kith's history in fashion.  The project started with hard goods, anchoring the collaboration on the court with a Pro Staff and Ultra racket, each designed differently, and then moved to on-court performance apparel and lifestyle products. ""We could have gone absolutely nuts,"" Devin says. ""We tried to keep it constrained to one of those elements that make sense and are crucial. In terms of what is the right balance between critical mass and too much, this is where Kith is best in the world. I was very much the student in that conversation."" In all, the men's collection includes 77 styles while the women's assortment is a 27-piece collection. There are another 19 styles for kids and then 37 accessories to span all the collections, including the rackets and balls.  Wilson and Kith partnered on creating a court within a Queens park and donating it to the community. ... [+] Balls recycled from the 2020 U.S. Open were recycled and used within the surface.  The Wilson x Kith partnership was about more than product. As a way to put their money behind their mission, the two paired on designing and creating a tennis court at the Ella Fitzgerald Playground in Kissena Corridor Park in Queens. The NYC Parks Department court, crafted by Laykold and RecycleBalls, uses tennis balls recycled from the 2020 U.S. Open in the surface. The court was given to the community.  The new Blade v8 racket debuted in New York City, timed with the U.S. Open.  The New York focus for Wilson didn't stop off the court. The brand debuted the Blade v8 to coincide with the U.S. Open tournament. Using the same patent-protected carbon fiber layup technology first used in the Clash to increase flexibility and stability without compromising power, Wilson says Blade v8 produces a more ""connected-to-the-ball feel"" to match the vertical swing path used in the modern game.  The v8 design features a newly tapered carbon fiber handle for stability and aesthetically gets highlighted by a color-shifting metallic design that changes from dark green to copper during movement. Tsitsipas and Simona Halep headline the most popular franchise on the professional tours.  For additional New York tie-ins, Wilson designed a graphic pattern off a NYC city map and placed it on a special-edition black Blade and white Clash frames. Every component adds up to an all-in on New York approach for Wilson. ""There is so much for people to consume nowadays, you need to give them diversity and give them enough,"" Devin says. ""When you are going to do something big, go big. We did all of these things because it is the U.S. Open and we are Wilson and it seemed like the right time to do it.""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2021/09/03/wilson-tennis-all-in-on-new-york-with-kith-collab-pop-up-museum-future-flagship-store/,"Wilson Tennis Goes All-In On New York With Kith Collab, Pop-Up Museum, Future Flagship Store"
"From a forecast perspective, the flooding event was spot on. The National Weather Service was sounding the alarm days in advance that the remnants of Hurricane Ida was going to be a huge problem for parts of the Northeast, including New York City. The National Weather Service - New York City put out an urgent message on Monday August 30th stating that remnants of Ida would produce heavy rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday. The message called for 3 to 5 inches of rain “with locally higher amounts possible.” That same alert also said, “This rainfall combined with antecedent conditions may lead to flash flooding.” Earlier this week, I even spent the first part of my Satellite Meteorology class at the University of Georgia dissecting the flood potential for the Northeast while Ida was still in the Southeast. I don’t claim to have all of the answers in this discussion, but there are three big messaging challenges that need to be considered. NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 02: Cars sit abandoned on the flooded Major Deegan Expressway following a ... [+] night of extremely heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida on September 02, 2021 in the Bronx borough of New York City. Multiple fatalities have been reported in the region after the storm passed through, causing massive flooding and a widespread disruption of subway service. A tornado touched down in Pennsylvania resulting in extensive property damage. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) This flooding event was caused by the interaction of Ida’s deep tropical moisture and a stationary front draped across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Urban impervious surfaces are also an unsung aspect of many catastrophic flooding disasters. Flash flooding is not just a function of what falls from the sky. The vast and ever-expanding parking lots, pavements, and roadways accelerate the runoff cycle of the water cycle we all learned about in 4th grade. As I told my students this week, a firehouse of moisture is in place and there is a lifting mechanism - a recipe for disaster. And in this case, the urban landscape of New York City did not help. Ok, so the hydrometeorological set-up was pretty obvious. The National Weather Service even issued rare Flash Flood Emergencies during the event. Do people understand what a NWS Flash Flood Emergency means?  Definition of a Flash Flood Emergency My colleague Dave Jones, founder and president of StormCenter Communications, Inc, raised this very question on social media. This event represented the first time that the National Weather Service - New York City had issued this type of warning. They even tweeted, “To be clear... this particular warning for NYC is the second time we've ever issued a Flash Flood Emergency (It's the first one for NYC).” The first Flash Flood Emergency for the area had been issued an hour prior to the Tweet for parts of northeastern New Jersey. According to the National Weather Service, a flash flood emergency is issued for, “exceedingly rare situations when a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from a flash flood is happening or will happen soon.” Earlier this summer, Jonathan Erdman wrote a piece at Weather.com entitled, “Why You Should Never Ignore a Flash Flood Emergency Issued by the National Weather Service.” Erdman also lays out the triggering criteria for such a warning. To Dave Jones point, the National Weather Service only started using the terminology in 2014. Candidly, the public already responds to flood warnings differently than hurricanes, blizzards, or tornadoes. NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 02: Commuters walk into a flooded 3rd Avenue / 149th st subway station and ... [+] disrupted service due to extremely heavy rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Ida on September 2, 2021, in New York City. Multiple fatalities have been reported in the region as the storm passed through New York City, dumping 3.15 inches of rain in the span of an hour in Central Park and causing massive flooding in Brooklyn. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) Which leads me to the second challenge. The prospect of flooding, in my professional opinion, doesn’t garner the same response level from the public, media, or stakeholders as a named hurricane, tornado or Nor’easter. If you think back to Hurricane Sandy, there was significant debate about whether to keep warning on it as a hurricane even as the storm transitioned to a “regular” extratropical cyclone. The weather-risks were going to be the same, but the discussion illustrated that some officials understood that people pay attention to named hurricanes.  My colleague Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami made an excellent point. He tweeted, “If 32 inches of snow is forecast for NYC (for example), they’d probably close things in advance and stage resources for the aftermath. But when there’s a forecast for extreme rainfall, ignore it until it happens?” His point echoes some things that I argued in a recent Forbes piece about messaging extreme rainfall and flooding. McNodly went on to ask why it matters if the water is frozen and ended by refuting the narrative that this was a “surprise.” He wrote, “ Maybe the EXACT placement of the heaviest amount was not known, but you don’t often see that pink “HIGH” risk cover so much area a whole day in advance.” NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 09: Pedestrians walk in the snow and wind in Manhattan on February 9, 2017 ... [+] in New York City. A major winter storm warning is forecast from Pennsylvania to Maine with the New York City area expected to receive up to one foot of snow. New York City schools are closed for the day. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Another challenge is the “rise of the Weather Apps.” Don’t get me wrong, Apps can be useful for general weather forecasts and guidance, but I personally do not rely on them for a rapidly, evolving extreme weather event of any kind. Yet, the public is increasingly conditioned to look at the little sun or rain icons to make decisions about the weather. My colleague Dr. Jonathan Gourley, a hydrometeorologist at the National Severe Storms Lab, tweeted, “Could it be over-reliance on non-NOAA sources of weather information such as apps that provide hyperlocal (yet often inaccurate) information down to the minute?” Virtually every meteorologist by now has heard, “But my app said...” Daniel Swain is a trusted source on weather and climate. The expert, who is affiliated with the University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA), echoed Gurley’s concern. He tweeted, “I think this is a bigger part of the problem than a lot of folks realize, and it is incredibly aggravating since the “last mile” forecast communication issue is critically important.” I will give my University of Georgia colleague Professor Janet Frick the last word. She is a psychology professor who also pays close attention to extreme weather events. Frick also understands behavior and aspects of human decision-making. Frick tweeted, “I think the phone weather App is a big part of it. And not enough people enabling emergency alerts through more reliable weather sources.” She closed by noting that the fix may need to be at local levels and involve realigning systems.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2021/09/03/the-forecasts-were-accurate3-big-messaging-challenges-with-the-new-york-city-flood/,The Forecasts Were Accurate - 3 Big Messaging Challenges With The New York City Flood

Carlson talked about a large variety of topics including dropping testosterone levels, increasing rates of suicide, unemployment, drug addiction and social hierarchy at the summit, which had the theme 'The Case for the American Experiment.' (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) On Thursday night, Tucker Carlson, the most-watched host in cable news, told Fox News Channel viewers “buying a fake vaccination card is an act of desperation by decent, law-abiding Americans who have been forced into a corner by tyrants.” Carlson—reacting to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr.’s decision to file charges against fifteen people involved in “a fake Covid-19 vaccination card conspiracy.” In a statement, Vance said “making, selling, and purchasing forged vaccination cards are serious crimes with serious public safety consequences.” But Carlson rejected that, telling viewers of Tucker Carlson Tonight that buying bogus vaccination cards is not “even close to a serious crime...you know what’s a serious crime? Forcing Americans to take drugs they don’t need or want,” despite the fact that Americans are not being forced to take any drugs—including the Covid-19 vaccine.  Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding of the Federation of American Scientists says Carlson’s rhetoric is dangerous. “Tucker Carlson encouraging/egging falsifying vaccine card(s) is criminal public endangerment,” Feigl-Ding said in a post to Twitter. “Faking a Covid-19 vaccine card is not ‘law abiding’—it’ll get people killed, including kids.” Feigl-Ding has, in recent days, been tracking the alarming rise of Covid cases—and hospitalizations—in young kids, with serious cases spiking in states like Florida, where schools are open but a statewide ban on mask mandates is in effect (though several large school districts have instituted masks mandates anyway).

"The United States added back a fewer-than-expected 235,000 jobs in August, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department—marking a significant slowdown from July and the labor market’s worst monthly showing since January, as experts note the pandemic’s resurgence has started to curtail the economic recovery. “Today’s jobs report reflects a major pullback in employment growth,” says one expert of Friday’s ... [+] jobs report. August’s job additions were much lower than the 720,000 new jobs economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg data, and they represent a significant decline from the roughly 930,000 jobs added back in July. Despite the slowdown, however, the unemployment rate of 5.2% fell from 5.4% in July to its lowest point during the pandemic, but is still well above pre-pandemic levels of less than 4%. There are now 8.4 million unemployed people in the United States, falling slightly since July—by about 300,000—and still markedly higher than 4 million in February 2020, the government said. According to the report, industries with notable job growth included professional services, transportation, warehousing and manufacturing, while employment in retail trade actually declined over the month. Reflecting rising uncertainty over the pandemic’s trajectory, employment in leisure and hospitality was virtually unchanged last month after adding an average of 350,000 jobs in each of the prior six months. Meanwhile, the report revealed stark labor-market disparities by race, with the unemployment rate among Black Americans ticking up to 8.8%, from 8.2% in July, despite the overall decline. “Today’s jobs report reflects a major pullback in employment growth likely due to the rising impact of the delta variant of Covid-19 on the U.S. economy,” Tony Bedikian, the head of global markets at Citizens Financial, said in a Friday note. “The virus is still weighing heavily on the U.S. jobs recovery, but we may also be seeing tectonic shifts in the workforce as the number of reported job openings remains high.” The unemployment rate hit a record high of 14.7% at the height of pandemic uncertainty in April 2020. Overall, the U.S. economy has added back roughly 17 million of the 22 million jobs lost at the height of pandemic uncertainty in March and April of last year. The disappointing jobs report comes just days after ADP’s monthly employment report highlighted a “downshift” in the labor market recovery marked by a decline in new hires last month. “The delta variant of Covid-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement alongside the report, adding that the labor market remains strong, but well off its performance in recent months. “Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.” Other experts have warned the post-Covid labor market recovery could drag on for years, and despite strong gains in past months, the Federal Reserve last week said its performance was still too “turbulent” to warrant a change in pandemic-era monetary policy. Friday’s disappointing report should only bolster that argument.

"Jackson Wood, director of industry strategy for global trade intelligence at Descartes I'm kicking off some research and writing on global trade compliance. During this research, I'll be talking to many of the solution providers in this market. My first call was with was with Descartes. Descartes is one of the leaders in this market. I had an interesting conversation with Jackson Wood, director of industry strategy for global trade intelligence. Mr. Wood believes there is a significant trend that is occurring with respect to the trade compliance department in companies. Five years ago, or so, trade compliance would often report up to the chief legal officer. Today, compliance is morphing from trade compliance into something broader. The compliance function might roll up to quality, logistics, supply chain, or even to the chief sustainability officer. “We're also seeing a lot more organizations that are starting to weave concepts of sustainability into some of their compliance programs.” Companies are moving from a narrow lens on trade compliance as a department that ensures the company is following “the letter of the law,” to a broader view of compliance as being part of a function that supports “broader risk, image, and reputational considerations.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has expanded their focus on investigating and preventing goods made by forced labor from entering U.S. commerce. The CBP defines “’forced labor’ is a form of modern-day slavery that violates international labor standards and universal human rights. It can include abuses such as physical and sexual violence, withholding of wages, and debt bondage. Foreign companies use forced labor to produce goods at lower costs, which hurts American businesses that respect fair labor standards.” Several Chinese firms, and some firms from other nations as well, are listed as companies that US companies cannot do business with.  But there are many companies and individuals who are not on the CBP sanctions list engaged in unethical behavior. A large multinational corporation is dealing with subcontractors, logistics service providers, contract manufacturer, and all kinds of trading partners across the globe. These companies and individuals all might engage in actions that could adversely impact a company's reputation. “We work with a number of very large global apparel manufacturers,” Mr. Woods explained. “There's certainly a slave labor component to that. But there's also an environmental degradation component. We work with one very prominent brand whose CEO has made a very strong public pledge that their business wants to be supportive of the Green Revolution. They're now starting to look at sustainable supply from not only a labor perspective but also agricultural and environmental protection perspectives. The amount of due diligence that global companies are doing now on all these different parties has begun to take on this much broader character.” The people working in trade compliance programs tend to have “good research skills, good decision support skills, and a good infrastructure around assessing what's happening from an international perspective.” These employees are in a perfect place to support a broader compliance mission. Because of this trend, Descartes has moved from talking about their global trade compliance solutions towards talking about trade intelligence solutions. Descartes's acquisition of Datamyne in 2016 marked their initial foray into providing a broader trade solution set; a solution said that continued to help clients with trade compliance but also included more strategic trade analysis data.  Datamyne collects, cleanses, and commercializes logistics trade data from nations across 5 continents. More than 500 million records are gathered each year from official filings with customs authorities and trade ministries. If a supplier is engaged in activities that could hurt the brand, subscribers can use Datamyne's intelligence tools to speed up sourcing with new companies. The solution can also improve supply chain decision making. The Datamyne data, for example, strongly suggests that the ocean freight problem is not just a short-term problem. From Descartes's perspective, upfront market insight and downstream risk management should both be part ofof a company’s overall approach to global trade. There is clearly a trend for companies to have a broader focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Perhaps the best example of this is Exxon Mobil 
  
  XOM 
 . To say that the oil industry has not historically been noted for their concern about environmental issues would be in understatement. But activist investors engaged in a successful campaign the gain boards seats. Now Exxon Mobil is disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data related to customer use of its petroleum products. If this can occur in the oil industry, it can occur in any industry. As companies respond to ESG pressures from the public, they may find that in their employees in the trade compliance department are a hidden jewel.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2021/09/03/beyond-trade-compliance-compliance-departments-are-asked-to-do-more/,Beyond Trade Compliance: Compliance Departments Are Asked To Do More
"Chinese President Xi Jinping addresses the opening of a training session for officials at the Party ... [+] School of the CPC Central Committee National Academy of Governance, Sept. 1, 2021. Global attention has been riveted in recent weeks to a raft of new economic and regulatory measures introduced by President Xi Jinping. These include tighter supervision of where Big-Tech firms can list, how they handle customer data, and even restricting the amount of time that students are allowed to play video games. All of these reforms have been wrapped up in an enticing wealth redistribution and social equity package labelled “common prosperity.”  Commentary has so far been focused on the impact of these new regulations on the Big-Tech firms and their ability to grow at the spectacular rates of the past decade. This is narrow thinking because what President Xi is setting out to do, in essence, is to establish a new economic order in China with an explicit expectation that everyone—the Chinese public, domestic and foreign investors, and the world at large—will have to comply. China is decoupling well before anyone expected and has significantly raised the stakes for America and its partners to respond. Before we dig into the specifics, it is useful to set some historic context to what President Xi is attempting to do, which is a fundamental reordering of China’s post-1979 economic consensus which was built on the proposition that the country’s openness to the tailwinds of globalization, trade and investment would make it gloriously rich. The peak moment of China’s openness was surely the country’s accession to the WTO in the early 2000s and achieving its ambition of becoming the factory of the world.  As Xi approaches the end of his second term and (potentially) prepares to start a third, he is attempting to open a new chapter in China’s history by seeking to sustain the Communist Party’s hold on power, while restructuring the economic, social, and political incentives away from winner-take-all capitalism.  The president is deeply ambivalent about the rise of the country’s capitalist class, note the public rebuke meted out to Jack Ma late last year for his intemperate outburst on the ills of China’s financial system. At the same time, the president must have been nervous about the prospect of someone like Jack Ma using his wealth and privilege to challenge the supremacy of the Communist Party in the future.  Ma’s disappearance from the public arena should be seen as a Mikhail Khodorkovsky moment for China—just as when Vladimir Putin sought to reduce the influence of the oligarchs two decades ago by detaining the most prominent of them.  The President’s pre-occupation with securing domestic political control coincided with a desire to become more assertive on the world stage. The chaos and disruption of the Trump era, when hostilities over trade and investment touched its peak, came as a challenge and a gift to Xi to complete his consolidation over the levers of power.  The articulation of a “dual circulation” strategy last year as a new model of economic growth was the first sign of China’s decoupling. Dual circulation has been described as a “new development pattern” where domestic and foreign markets can boost each other, with the domestic market as the “mainstay.”  For foreign investors still eager to tap into China’s enormous domestic market, the message from Beijing was clear—you play by our rules or don’t play at all. The rush of global finance into China’s bond market and into wealth management is a sign that Xi’s decoupling strategy is paying off.  The rules-based international order which China advocated during an earlier era now essentially boils down to a Xi-based international order. The new anti-sanctions bill slowly making its way will penalize American and European financial institutions operating in Hong Kong who implement western sanctions against Chinese businesses and individuals. This is a single circulation chokepoint for foreign investors in Xi’s grand vision to decouple from the western order and build his own.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/vasukishastry/2021/09/03/china-is-decoupling-and-setting-its-own-economic-order/,China Is Decoupling And Setting Its Own Economic Order
"Shooter Box, running September 1–24, is an exhibition curated by Rachel Berger of the California College of the Arts (CCA). The centerpiece of the show is Berger’s own Bullet I, an Xbox controller cast in lead and copper, a commentary on what she sees as the cynical use of Xbox controllers in weapon systems. “The military has deliberately blurred the line between toys and weapons,” Berger told Forbes. Bullet I by Rachel Berger is a lead cast of an Xbox controller with copper buttons Bullet I is part of a long tradition of sculpted versions of everyday objects placed in galleries to make people look at them differently. Berger, design professor and Chair of CCA’s Graphic Design Program, is concerned to see childhood games becoming military hardware. “I believe the Xbox controller’s seeming innocence is the key to its danger,” says Berger. The controllers made the headlines a few years back when the U.S. navy started using them to operate the photonics mast – the modern version of a periscope – in their Virginia-class submarines. Previously, a custom-built controller was used, but this was clunky and not intuitive, and came with a price tag of $38,000. The game controllers proved to be far easier to use, and cheaper to replace. These Xbox controllers may even be used to aim and fire the high-energy laser weapons which the Navy is now integrating into the Virginia-class photonics masts.  Bullet III, a customized Xbox controller by Rachel Berger  The same controller is being used in developing other unmanned systems such as the U.S. Army's Robotic Wingman vehicle. Berger argues that while there may be benefits to using this hardware, there is a less obvious downside. “The Xbox controller is certainly much cheaper and much better designed than anything the military could come up with, but I believe the use of it is ‘expensive’ in terms of the consequences of blurring the line between toys and weapons,” says Berger. Her point is underscored by design history. “Early consoles offered a range of specialized input devices besides the classic controller: light guns, steering wheels, and flight-sticks, even fishing rods and maracas,” says Berger. “Xbox and PlayStation, today’s leading consoles, have converged on a similar all-in-one controller, with a complex combination of thumbsticks, d-pads, buttons, bumpers, and triggers.” The modern Xbox controller is, then, a complex piece of kit, but one which many people are adept as using after years of Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty.  “Proponents of the military’s use of Xbox controllers favor terms like instinctive and intuitive to describe soldiers’ speedy adoption of the hardware,” says Berger. “But it's not like the controller’s 16-button, dual analogue console gamepad is easy to master. It's that, having spent hundreds of hours playing with the controller as children, the soldiers have already mastered it. They find the controller to be intuitive because of its familiarity, not its simplicity.” Berger notes that the military use the Xbox 360 controller rather than the more recent Xbox One, apparently because the older design is more familiar among those who are now handling military hardware. Some 27 million were sold and many are still in use. A video replays CNN coverage of Desert Storm, known as 'the Video Game War' for its use of imagery ... [+] from weapons. Other items on show at the Shooter Box exhibition include another Berger Xbox controller, Bullet III, and a display showing America’s Army, a video game developed as a recruiting aid and distributed as a free Xbox download — and a memorial to U.S. service members killed in Iraq created using America’s Army messaging system. There’s also a video of CNN coverage of Desert Storm, quickly nicknamed the Video Game War. Other items include a lead mold for toy soldiers dating from WW1 and the casts and other items used to create Bullet I. But why should the military use of convenient commercial hardware provoke such a strong reaction? Perhaps because it may have more to do with culture wars than military operations. “Ultimately, I believe the military’s reasons for repurposing the controllers are a smoke screen,” says Berger.  Berger suggests that the training and ergonomics aspects are less important than what the controller stands for. “By virtue of its status as a designed object, the Xbox controller is inscribed with far more consequential meanings and values than the military acknowledges. In a chilling echo of the simulator that turns out to be real in Orson Scott Card’s science fiction novel Ender’s Game, the military is repurposing a beloved object from the childhood of the gamer generation for the American war machine.” Shooter Box runs to September 24.

"Shang-Chi The next MCU movie hits theaters this weekend, Marvel’s Shang-Chi, historic for its Asian star, cast and director, which is getting great reviews and it’s something I’ve eagerly been wanting to see. But because of Disney’s recent reversal of on-demand streaming access for its theatrical blockbusters, I cannot do so in a way that I feel safe, even if I’m willing to throw $30 at Disney Plus for a solo showing on my couch. That option no longer exists. Disney, in the wake of Black Widow’s release, which had questionable box office results and a resulting lawsuit from Scarlett Johansson regarding the movie’s simultaneous access on Disney Plus, has opted to keep Shang-Chi theatrical-only for 45 days. Shorter than “normal” times, but an eternity for Marvel fans, who will obviously feel the need to see it sooner.  But Disney is sticking with a decision they made when it looked like the pandemic was passing. Here, in the US where I live, that is far from the case, and for my part, I simply cannot in good conscience go to a movie theater right now, even masked, even vaccinated. First, there’s the environment. The ultra-tight restrictions of the pandemic era are mostly gone. Here in Ohio, the theaters near me are not requiring you wear masks to attend movies, even if the staff might be. And there are no more occupancy restrictions. This is what a showing of Shang-Chi looks like at my local theater tonight. The X’s are sold seats. Does that look socially distanced to you? Hard pass Then there’s the pandemic itself, which is far from over due to the absolutely wild spread of the delta variant of COVID, even more contagious than the original. Breakthrough infections in the vaccinated are happening here all the time, and even refusing to eat or drink during the show to keep a mask on, I’m not comfortable in a tightly packed theater in a state with barely over a 50% vaccination rate, and positive cases that will not stop climbing day after day after day, now approaching heights not seen before a vaccine even existed: Nope This is a business decision by Disney. They think that the movie will perform better if it debuts in theaters, plus they can avoid any potential Scarjo-type lawsuits about Disney Plus access. But this 45 day window is enticing people to unsafely attend packed movie theaters at a time when everyone doesn’t seem to understand just how rapidly the new virus variant is spreading. And there is an alternate option sitting right there, going unused, a premium price VOD release that Disney did for loads of other movies when theaters were actually potentially safer because they at least had mask mandates and seat distancing policies in place. This is unacceptable. If Shang-Chi bombs at the box office, it won’t be because of the quality of the film, but the fact that half its potential viewership may not feel safe enough to attend. I certainly don’t, and would have easily paid for it at home. We’ll see if Disney sticks to its guns, or if something changes here after this opening weekend.

"Michelob Ultra expanded into sports through partnerships with Serena Williams, Jimmy Butler, Alex ... [+] Morgan, Anthony Davis, Brooks Koepka and Nneka Ogwumike. When the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, like many brands and organizations, Michelob Ultra needed to figure out how to pivot during the uncertain times. The brand doubled down its efforts investing heavily in encouraging healthy and active lifestyles—especially at a time where activity was limited with stay-at-home mandates in place—while also broadening its category approach into the sports world. “Sports, in particular the NBA, have been a crucial pillar in our strategy and that approach in terms of bringing our brand to more fans in a relevant way, bringing our brand into different markets and parts of the country, and bringing our brand into different occasions, namely sports viewing,” said Ricardo Marques, Michelob Ultra vice-president of marketing. “It’s been instrumental in helping us accelerate the momentum of the brand.” Aftering growing 16.2% in volume in 2019, Michelob Ultra accelerated its growth by 22.2% in 2020 despite the pandemic’s limitations. Trailing only Budweiser ($7.2 billion), Michelob boasted $3.1 billion in U.S. sales last year, with sports playing a major part. Michelob Ultra’s first major foray into the world of sports—save for previous commercials during the Super Bowl—was as the official beer of Capital One’s 
  
  COF 
  The Match: Champions for Charity, a charity golf event pitting Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady. The May 2020 event, which raised $20 million for Covid-19 relief efforts, was just the beginning for Michelob, which expanded into sports further through brand partnerships with athletes including Serena Williams, Jimmy Butler, Alex Morgan, Anthony Davis, Brooks Koepka and Nneka Ogwumike. Ahead of the NBA Restart last July, Michelob Ultra was named official beer partner of the NBA. The brand didn’t just rest on its laurels with its new multi-year partnership, but instead played an integral part in making the league’s bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex outside Orlando feel and sound as close to a full arena as it could. Together with Microsoft 
  
  MSFT 
 , a 17-foot video board was erected to bring 320 fans “inside” the venue virtually for each game as part of the Michelob Ultra Courtside. Fans, players’ families, contest winners and even celebrities popped up on the screen to show their support of the league’s restart in the promotion that not only gave fans the ability to be closer to the game despite physical limitations, but that gave the players a high-energy in-venue experience. Dirk Nowitzki, Bill Walton, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Pau Gasol, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ... [+] former President Barack Obama, and Shaquille O'Neal were among those ""in attendance"" for Game 1 of the 2020 NBA Finals. “It was huge, they did an incredible job,” said Miami Heat all-star forward Jimmy Butler, who showcased his singing abilities in Michelob’s TV spot to celebrate the NBA Restart. “A lot of my family and friends were actually on the screen, and I could really say that they enjoyed that experience. When I talked to them they were like, ‘Yo, did you see me on the screen?’ and I’m like, ‘No, I’m sorry, I wasn’t staring up at the screen. I was trying to make a basket.’  “It was so cool with them not being able to be there yet still be there. It was an environment and a thing that so many wanted to experience. From everybody I talked to on my side, it was an unreal experience because it was so different and a first-of-its-kind so everyone was locked into it.” For Marques and Michelob Ultra, Michelob Ultra Courtside was an extension of the brand’s messaging: It’s only worth it if you enjoy it. “We have what we believe is a very unique angle and point of view,” he said. “The approach we’re taking is a very people-centric one. Michelob Ultra Courtside was born not because we wanted to make another ad, but because we were literally investing in creating an experience that would be meaningful to people.” Michelob Ultra’s investment in sports continues to expand in 2021. As bars and restaurants reopened ahead of the summer, Michelob Ultra teamed up with Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt to encourage people to head to the bar after a run or workout on July 24, offering to cover their drink as part of Bolt’s “running tab.” Peyton Manning’s enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August inspired Michelob Ultra to create a bronze “Smiling Peyton Bust Tap Handle” for use in bars in meaningful Manning locales including New Orleans, Indianapolis, Denver and Knoxville, Tennessee. And to honor Women’s Equality Day on August 26, Michelob Ultra announced it would commit $100 million over the next five years to increase visibility for women’s sports and female athletes. The brand will allocate 50% of its lifestyle media towards women—a 40% increase from where Michelob Ultra is today—and add to its roster of female athletes and influencers while ensuring they are equally part of the brand’s creative and advertising. While Marques wouldn’t provide any details on what’s next for Michelob Ultra, don’t be surprised to see and hear more from Butler as the NBA starts its 2021-22 season in mid-October. “We have very exciting plans and ideas. You’ll definitely be hearing more about Jimmy Butler and Michelob Ultra in ways you didn’t think were possible,” he said. “The NBA is a tremendous partner. We always say ‘partnerships not sponsorships,’ and they’re the epitome of that. We’re incredibly excited in terms of where we’re going to take the point of view of this brand into the NBA and beyond. A lot more to come. I think we’ve only seen the beginning.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2021/09/03/how-sports-helped-fuel-michelob-ultras-growth-especially-during-the-pandemic/,"How Sports Helped Fuel Michelob Ultra’s Growth, Especially During The Pandemic"
"Lt. Daniel Lee, from Fresno, California, assigned to the aircraft carrier USS 'Gerald R. Ford,' ... [+] observes Naval Station Norfolk during a sea and anchor evolution on Aug. 20, 2021. U.S. president Joe Biden surprised and disappointed naval observers in May when his administration released its budget proposal for 2022. Despite a longstanding bipartisan consensus across the American naval establishment that the U.S. Navy needs to grow in order to keep pace with—to say nothing of staying ahead of—a growing Chinese fleet, Biden’s $212-billion budget for the Department of the Navy included money for just eight new front-line warships. Eight new ships in one year is inadequate, over the long term, to grow the U.S. fleet from today’s 296 front-line “battleforce” ships to 355, the number many policymakers have fixated on.  A warship typically lasts 30 or 35 years before it wears out or becomes hopelessly obsolete or uneconomical to support. Getting to 355 battleforce ships in a decade or so would require at least a dozen new ships a year, if not more.  As widely expected, the U.S. Congress all but rejected Biden’s proposal. Lawmakers are on track to add billions of dollars to the shipbuilding budget, enough to buy as many as 13 battleforce ships. All of the sudden, the Navy’s expansion is back on track.  The eight new front-line ships the White House included in its original budget proposal include one Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, two Virginia-class submarines, a Constellation-class frigate, a John Lewis-class oiler, two Navajo-class oceangoing tugs and a new surveillance ship.  Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat who is the vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee, made it clear the House of Representatives would be adding ships. “China is a threat, and we need to take it seriously,” Luria said.  The extra vessels came piecemeal. A subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee in May added $2 billion for a second destroyer. Then in July, the Senate Armed Services Committee endorsed the second destroyer and also proposed to increase the overall defense budget to $34 billion. The House Armed Services Committee followed suit on Tuesday, when it voted to add $24 billion to the budget—$10 billion less than the Senate had pitched, but enough to pay for a third destroyer, an America-class amphibious assault ship, two Spearhead-class catamaran transports and a second oiler. The committee cut one of the new tugs the White House had proposed to buy. “Proud to join this overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to strengthen our national defense,” Luria tweeted. The House and Senate still must reconcile, then vote on, their separate proposals—and Biden must sign off on the resulting budget before it becomes law. But as it stands, the Navy is on track to buy 13 battleforce ships in 2022.  That, combined with new restrictions on how many older ships the fleet can decommission, is enough to keep the fleet growing ... for now. But to get to 355 ships, the White House and Congress must sustain that build-rate for a decade or more.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/03/all-of-the-sudden-the-us-navy-is-on-track-to-get-a-whole-lot-of-new-ships/,"All Of The Sudden, The U.S. Navy Is On Track To Get A Whole Lot Of New Ships"

"Rapid Arctic warming driven by climate change could be responsible for the increasingly extreme winter weather in some parts of the United States, according to a study published in the journal Science on Thursday, providing the first evidence linking February’s killer winter storm to human-driven global warming.  Increasing severe cold weather in the U.S. could be linked to warming Arctic conditions, a study ... [+] found.  Melting sea ice, increasing snowfall over Siberia and rapidly rising Arctic temperatures—the Arctic is warming around two times faster than the global average—are potentially disrupting the weather system that usually traps cold air in the Arctic, the researchers found. This disruption can have a big knock-on effect on complex weather patterns and can cause the system, known as the polar vortex, to stretch and allow cold air to move over parts of the U.S. and Canada, the researchers wrote.    Extreme winter weather in the U.S. was more common when this vortex was disrupted and there has been an increasing number of stretching events since satellite observations began in 1979, the researchers wrote.    The lethal Texas cold snap in February was likely a result of this stretching process, the   scientists wrote.   The study “provides cautionary evidence that a warming planet will not necessarily protect us from the devastating impacts of severe winter weather,” said lead author Judah Cohen, an MIT professor and director of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk management firm. The researchers’ findings, based on computer modeling and observational data, give further weight to the counterintuitive idea that global warming can actually lead to colder weather in some places. There is no scientific consensus yet on the role Arctic warming may play in increasingly cold extremes in the U.S., though the Texas snowstorm in February reinvigorated discussion on the matter.  The U.S. has faced a number of climate-related disasters this year, including severe heat waves, droughts, wildfires, storms and, most recently, hurricane Ida. While experts clearly and confidently tie the increasing severity and frequency of such events to human-driven climate change, the reasons behind the uptick in cold weather has remained contentious. Details of the February freeze that killed hundreds and left millions in Texas without power are still coming to light months after the fact. In a recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading U.N. authority on climate science, warned that global temperatures will likely exceed limits set under the Paris agreement unless drastic and immediate action is taken, warning that some changes already wrought may be irreversible for millennia. Even in its best case scenarios, the group expects extreme weather events to get worse and become more frequent. A recent report from the U.N.’s weather agency highlights the increasing severity and cost of extreme weather, though better warning systems mean fewer people are dying from them.   Weather-Related Disasters Skyrocketed Fivefold Over Past 50 Years, Says U.N.

"A poster of Saving Chintu. India’s director-producer Tushar Tyagi won hearts of critics with his film, Saving Chintu and the film has also been nominated at various international film festivals. In an interview, Tyagi talks about working on the movie and why he wanted Adil Hussain for the film. He also shares his views on the concept of filmmaking.  An excerpt: What inspired you to make Saving Chintu? Filmmaker Tushar Tyagi Saving Chintu derives inspiration from real-life incidents. At a dinner in 2016, My Indian- American doctor revealed to me that he was illegally adopted by his American parents from an Indian orphanage back in the 1970s. As a child,  while he was living in an orphanage, he was suffering from malnourishment and tuberculosis. The orphanage authorities at a high price helped his parents to produce a few essential fake documents that were required for him to leave the country. His parents wanted to accelerate the process as quickly as possible, so that they could get him to get him the treatment that he needed at the time. However, the film is also inspired by the life of Jeremy, someone I met at a spiritual retreat in Rishikesh. “I went to an ashram in Rishikesh to detoxify myself mentally and emotionally. On the second day, I met Jeremy who has been living in India for the past 20 years and has been running a shelter for kids in Maharashtra.  A queer guy originally from New York, Jeremy came to India after being diagnosed with HIV-AIDS. “Currently, runs a shelter, and my conversation about the massive struggle he had to overcome to run this shelter and to be able to provide constant food, medication, and shelter inspired me to make this film. Also, I've been living in America for almost 10 years now, and seeing the rights for LGBTQIA+ people there and people of the same community in India don't, It bothers me quite a lot. when I came to know In India same-sex couples are not allowed to adopt children, an instant question in my mind arose how can you define the kind of parents one can be depending on their sexual orientation? How can being a heterosexual couple guarantees of one being a good parent?. Because of medieval thinking of the non-acceptance from our society and its law, the opportunities for these kids to get a better home, education, and future are being severely altered. Please tell us about the casting for the film. What were your reasons for picking the actors?  During the script writing, I'd always imagined Adil Hussian as Dr. Sanjay. I didn't even have a second or third option for that role. When I reached out to him at the time he was filming in Atlanta. He asked me to email the script and said he will get back after reading the script, and will let me know if this could be something he might want to be a part of. I didn't hear from him for three weeks, by then I was pretty sure that he might not be interested. Around the fourth week I followed up with him, he replied that he had been super busy the way his scenes are scheduled in Atlanta,and told me that he will definitely read it tonight and get back by tomorrow. Next day I received an email from him, I remember for three hours I didn't open his email, I was so terrified, in case he says no I don't see anyone playing this role. After three hours my mom asked me to just go for it. I checked his email, he'd written 'I love the script. I would love to be a part of this film', it made me very happy. We ended up flying Sachin Bhatt from Los Angeles (who plays an Indian American). We didn't have a budget to fly another actor, a white actor from LA but luckily we came across Edward Sonnenblick who is American but lives in Mumbai and works in the Indian Film Industry. When Dipannita Sharma was locked for the role of Meera, I was so happy, as she came in with such force and grace and owned the role. We had to do four rounds of the audition but finally, the actor's universe intended to play the characters ended up on the team. It's such an overwhelming and magical process. You always pick subjects very crucial to the human race, but your films are not making it to the masses. How do you see this part of your filmmaking? I always pick subjects or stories I connect the most with, stories of human resilience, kindness, love, loss, learning, and life experiences. The stories I think must be told, The stories I relate with because somewhere down the line I've lived through similar experiences of love, loss, lost and gained faith,confidence or resilience. I make my films with all honesty and research, I rarely am bothered by what amount of audience it might reach. I think it's a process of growing. My first film back in 2013 was just watched by my family, friends, film school mates and audiences of the film festival it went to. As a filmmaker, I find happiness and treasure in messages and emails I get from audiences after watching my film. When Saving Chintu was doing its film festival circuit until earlier this year, I got so many messages on Instagram by the people in America, Canada, parts of Europe, Australia, and reading their messages and how they felt connected with the film brought me immense happiness, one kid from Montreal sent me a DM that he came out to his parents after watching Saving Chintu. The kind of effect a cinema can have on people's lives shocks me in a good way quite often. Is filmmaking a tool to initiate debate among those willing for one, or do you also intend to make an impact at a larger level in the society? Definitely yes, filmmaking is a tool of mass reach & impact . Films can start movements & conversations. In today's world films can wake people up and lead to creating woke communities, societies and countries at large. I think films are not just tools to initiate debates but also to give audiences an astronomical experience. Like I generally say, mankind hasn't been to Mars yet but films like The Martian gives us a peek at what might we experience when we finally end up over there. Films like Interstellar and many more act as a tool to push and widen one's imagination. With all the technology available today everything is achievable . Tell us about your upcoming projects. We recently rolled out a short film named Laali featuring Pankaj Tripathi in a film festival circuit. It is Pankaj Tripathi's first ever short film. I'm an executive producer on it. Directed by Abhiroop Basu, it has been doing well. Also, I have two other films. I have directed one film titled Lappad featuring Samarth Shandilya and produced another one called Man & Wife directed by brilliant filmmaker Rahul Roye. Both the movies are coming out this year.

"Primark is to open its latest Philadelphia store later this month as U.S. expansion accelerates. ... [+] (Photo by Lisa Lake/Getty Images for Primark) Irish value fashion chain Primark has announced that its upcoming Philadelphia store marks an “important milestone” in its expansion plans as the retailer prepares to open its 13th store in the U.S. later this month. The value fashion retailer first entered the U.S. back in 2015 and Primark’s newest U.S. outlet will open in the Fashion District Philadelphia shopping mall, bringing the total number of Primark stores in Pennsylvania state to three. The new 34,200sq ft Philadelphia store is set to create over 350 jobs and the retailer is promising that the opening event on September 16 will include giveaways and a DJ. Originally focusing on the North-East of the U.S., Primark stores have opened in Florida and Chicago in recent years, while the retailer has also signed leases for a new store in Virginia, and has plans to open two stores in New York. Primark has also been bullish on the Philadelphia region, open shops in recent years at the Willow Grove Park Mall and the King of Prussia Mall. After a hiatus during the pandemic, Primark is also ramping up its European expansion as the retailer’s notoriously cautious approach to store expansion – it's only growth channel as it has no transactional online presence – goes up a gear. Announcing the official opening date, Primark U.S. president Andy Stewart said: “We are delighted to welcome Philadelphians to our latest North East location in the U.S., bringing Primark’s unique formula of quality fashion, beauty and homeware with an amazing price tag. “Our Fashion District store will mark another important milestone in our ongoing expansion in the U.S. and bringing our ‘Amazing Fashion at Amazing Prices’ to more and more customers.” Confirmed future openings include Tysons Corner Center, Tysons, Va., and Green Acres Mall, Valley Stream, N.Y. as part of what Tom Meager, global group property director, called an “ambitious growth strategy in the United States,” as the value retailer makes further inroads across major U.S. cities. But the U.S. is not the only market primed for growth. In June, Primark opened its first ever Czech store on Prague’s famous Wenceslas Square. The opening of the store, which with Primark’s latest U.S. opening will bring the worldwide estate up to circa 400 stores, marked its venture into its 14th market as it seeks to target growth in central and eastern Europe. Despite the pandemic Primark still managed to open more stores, with growth due to speed up over the ... [+] coming months. (Photo by John Milner/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Primark has opened stores in both Poland and Slovenia over the past two years and is set to open further Polish and Czech stores, as well as a debut Slovakian store in 2022. Primark has also revealed ambitious expansion plans in Italy in which it aims to more than double its store estate across the country by the end of 2022. Currently the value fashion retailer has six stores in Italy, and it now intends to open another eight stores to bring its Italian portfolio to 14 in total. Primark opened its first store in Italy five years ago. The first of the new eight stores will open in Rome, within the Roma Est Shopping Centre, and the retailer hopes to add new store openings in Catania, Sicily, at the Centro Sicilia Shopping Centre, and Chieti, Abruzzo, within the Megalo Shopping Centre, by the end of this year, before opening stores in Turin, Bologna, and Milan next year. Despite the lockdowns and trading restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, Primark still managed to open six new stores in France, Spain, the U.S. and Italy in the 27-week period to the end of February this year and has plans to open 15 new stores over the coming months in Spain, the U.S., the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic. The expansion plans mean an additional net 700,000 sq ft of selling space is expected to be added in Primark’s current financial year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2021/09/03/primark-heralds-philadelphia-as-important-milestone-in-us-growth/,Primark Heralds Philadelphia As Important Milestone In U.S. Growth
"Dak Prescott entered the off-season with no active contract and a broken ankle that had ended his 2020 season in Week 5. But the star quarterback had enough leverage remaining after two years of intense negotiations that he managed to come to a four-year, $160 million agreement with the Dallas Cowboys in March, with $126 million guaranteed. That included an upfront payment of $66 million—the largest signing bonus in NFL history. The deal gives the 28-year-old the top spot in the 2021 Forbes ranking of the highest-paid NFL players, one notch ahead of seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. Prescott’s total of $87 million in pretax earnings also includes $12 million from endorsements.  That is impressive—one of the best sponsor numbers in the NFL—but Brady blows right past him with $45 million off the field, including the proceeds from a massive partnership with cryptocurrency exchange FTX that he struck in June and his appearances in a couple of Subway commercials. Those new deals, plus bonuses triggered by his 2020 exploits for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, help push the 44-year-old quarterback past the NFL off-the-field record of $31 million he established on Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes just four months ago, installing him as an emphatic No. 2 on the NFL earnings list with $72.5 million, including his playing contract. In all, the NFL’s ten highest-paid players are set to make $418 million in 2021, according to Forbes’ calculations, an increase of 9% from last year despite a dip in the salary cap that has dented salaries around the league. The top ten will collect $306.6 million in salary and bonus in 2021, a 5% drop from last year and the lowest on-the-field figure since 2017, but offset that with $111 million from their off-the-field ventures, including endorsements, licensing, appearances and memorabilia, as well as businesses they operate. That represents an 84% increase from 2020’s top ten, mostly thanks to Brady, and demolishes the previous high-water mark of $67 million from 2016. Quarterbacks dominate once again, taking seven of the ten spots in the ranking, including Brady’s Super Bowl LV rival Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs and the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers, who land at Nos. 3 and 4 with $44.8 million and $33.4 million, respectively. A non-quarterback—San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle Trent Williams—rounds out the top five with $33.3 million. Trevor Lawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft in April, comes in at No. 8 with $30.8 million, becoming the first rookie to rank among the top ten since the 2011 collective bargaining agreement drastically reduced contracts for the sport’s top draft picks. Lawrence, who received a $24.1 million signing bonus from the Jacksonville Jaguars, is adding $6 million off the field, including his own endorsement deal with FTX and partnerships with brands like Adidas, Gatorade and Fanatics. The world’s most lucrative sports league is riding the momentum of monster new media rights and betting deals, but NFL players are not yet sharing in the spoils. While the average team value is up 14% to a record $3.5 billion this year, the decline in game-day revenue from ticket, concessions and merchandise sales amid the pandemic led the NFL to cut its salary cap for the first time in a decade, to $182.5 million for 2021, from $198.2 million last year. That has tempered spending by front offices left facing a payroll crunch after handing out a wave of huge contracts in recent years. This off-season, according to Spotrac, the league’s 32 teams committed a combined $4.6 billion in extensions and free-agent contracts (down 10% from 2020) with $2.5 billion in guaranteed money (down 11%). Still, for the league’s superstars, sponsors are easing the pain. Dak Prescott’s $66 million signing bonus from the Dallas Cowboys beat the $57.5 million mark for a single-payment bonus that Aaron Rodgers had set in 2018. The 28-year-old quarterback owns a significant stake in four Walk-On’s restaurants in Texas and is up to $12 million in endorsements, including a major new deal with NFT platform Ethernity. A jump from Adidas to Jordan Brand in June also supplied a sizable raise.  Just a year or two ago, Tom Brady was making $12 million a year off the field. Now, after winning a seventh Super Bowl title in his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and making his partnerships more of a focus, the 44-year-old quarterback is hauling in almost four times as much. Beyond his endorsements, which include Fanatics and Under Armour in addition to his huge new deal with FTX, Brady has the TB12 supplements line and a media company, 199 Productions, as well as an NFT platform, Autograph, that he launched this summer. He also reportedly picked up $3.4 million in playing-contract incentives for his performance in 2020 and the Bucs’ championship (a number not reflected in his earnings for this list).  After signing a ten-year, $450 million extension with the Kansas City Chiefs last year—far and away the NFL’s biggest contract ever—Patrick Mahomes had the deal restructured this off-season to help his team create space under the new salary cap, with $21.7 million becoming a bonus for 2021. The quarterback, who turns 26 in two weeks, started ramping up his endorsements after winning Super Bowl LIV in February 2020 and counts Adidas, State Farm and Oakley among his partners. Mahomes, who added a small stake in MLB’s Kansas City Royals last year, became a minority owner with MLS’s Sporting Kansas City in July.  Aaron Rodgers is staying in Green Bay after all, emerging with a reworked contract from an off-season of drama in which he expressed frustration with Packers management and stirred speculation that he might retire rather than return to the team. The 37-year-old quarterback is partnered with brands like Adidas, State Farm and Fanatics and is a cofounder of Online Sports Database, a website modeled after IMDb.com that launched in April and aims to offer athlete profiles including salary and endorsement information. Rodgers remained a fixture on TV screens through the NFL off-season, taking a turn as a Jeopardy! guest host and playing in the July edition of The Match, the exhibition golf event in which he and Bryson DeChambeau beat Tom Brady and Phil Mickelson.  Trent Williams, traded to San Francisco last year, signed a six-year, $138 million deal in March to stay with the 49ers. Of the contracts signed this year, only Dak Prescott did better with his signing bonus than Williams’ $30.1 million. The 33-year-old offensive tackle is light on traditional endorsements but profits from a stable of apartment complexes and single-family homes he owns. He has also been active with NBA Top Shot, trading the NFT collectibles and buying a small stake in the marketplace’s parent, Dapper Labs.  The Washington Football Team locked up Jonathan Allen, a 2017 first-round pick and budding star at defensive tackle, in July with a four-year, $72 million extension that included a $30 million signing bonus. The 26-year-old, who has small deals with sponsors like Anheuser-Busch and Ubisoft, was his team’s nominee for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award last season, highlighting his work with homeless youth.  Russell Wilson will rake in $19 million in salary this season from the four-year, $140 million extension he signed with the Seattle Seahawks in 2019. The 32-year-old quarterback added three sponsors this summer: Fanatics, the memorabilia powerhouse; sports retailer Lids, with whom he will launch a hat line from his 3BRAND label; and children’s entertainment company Spin Master, with whom he is releasing a toy football.  Trevor Lawrence, this year’s first overall draft pick, was seen as the most marketable NFL prospect in years after three exceptional seasons at Clemson that featured three College Football Playoff appearances and a runner-up finish for the Heisman Trophy. Despite landing with the Jacksonville Jaguars—a small-market team with little track record of success—the 21-year-old quarterback has had no problem piling up partnerships with at least ten brands, including Adidas, Gatorade and Fanatics. He’s also become one of the major celebrity voices in the world of cryptocurrency, investing his signing bonus in crypto through Blockfolio, an app now rebranded under the FTX label.  The Los Angeles Rams dealt Jared Goff to Detroit in March after a disappointing 2020, and he’ll take over as the Lions’ quarterback with a restructured contract paying him $5.7 million in salary and a $20 million bonus in 2021. The 26-year-old, who will be looking to return to his Pro Bowl form of 2017 and 2018, is partnered with brands like Banana Republic, Fanatics and Red Bull and uses his JG16 clothing line to raise money for charity, helping Warren Lane Elementary School in Inglewood, California, build a new library.  The Giants slapped the franchise tag on Leonard Williams for the second straight year, but the sides finally agreed on a long-term contract in March, keeping him in New York on a three-year, $63 million deal with $45 million guaranteed, including a $22.5 million signing bonus. Since the Giants spent two mid-round draft picks to acquire the defensive lineman from the crosstown-rival Jets in 2019, Williams, now 27, has been perhaps their most effective pass-rusher, with 11.5 sacks last season.

"Taliban co-founder and political chief Abdul Ghani Baradar is set to lead the new government in Afghanistan, reports said on Friday, formalizing the Taliban’s grip on Kabul just days after the U.S. military and its allies withdrew all their soldiers and officials from the country. Abdul Ghani Baradar helped lead the Taliban’s peace negotiations with several foreign players. Baradar will be aided by two other senior leaders: Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai and Mohammad Yaqoob, son of deceased Taliban co-founder Mullah Omar, Reuters reported, citing a Taliban official. The Taliban’s supreme religious leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada, will not be part of the political leadership but will remain in charge of religious matters. The leadership announcement comes at a time when new Afghan leadership faces crises on multiple fronts, including a devastated economy and growing rebellion in the country’s northern Panjshir Valley. Peace talks between the Taliban and a militia group led by Ahmad Massoud—the son of former anti-Taliban Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud—have reportedly broken down, with both sides preparing for a possible conflict. The Taliban government will also have to tackle an Afghan economy that is on the verge of collapse as all foreign aid has dried up and the country’s $9.4 billion in cash reserves have been frozen. Baradar, who co-founded the Taliban in the 1990s, held several senior government positions when the militant group was previously in power between 1996 and 2001. After the Taliban government was dismantled by the 2001 U.S. invasion, Baradar helped lead the insurgent group’s fighters. He was eventually captured in Pakistan, near the city of Karachi, in 2010 in a mission that is believed to have been jointly planned by Pakistani and U.S. operatives. But he was released from prison in 2018 by Pakistani officials after the Trump administration reportedly lobbied for his release as it began peace talks with the Taliban. Since his release, Baradar has helped lead the Taliban’s negotiations with the U.S. The Taliban’s former supreme leader and co-founder, Mohammed Omar, coined the nom de guerre “Baradar” for his colleague – which means “brother”. Baradar had worked closely with Omar in a group of Mujahideens who fought against the Soviet presence in the country in the 1980s. The Taliban has indicated it will try to seek international recognition of its government’s legitimacy as this would be crucial for opening the door to international aid. Access to foreign aid and the country’s foreign cash reserves will be critical for the Taliban as Afghanistan teeters on the brink of economic collapse. Both the United States and its European allies have urged the Taliban to form an inclusive government that represents women and the country’s various religious and ethnic minorities.

"Will a run of negative news events, economic concerns and health concerns turn U.S. airports - and ... [+] other travel industry locations like hotels, restaurants and attractions - remain reasonably active this fall, or turn into near-ghost towns as they did early on in the Covid-19 pandemic cycle at places like this, a terminal at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in April 2020? ROB CARR/Getty Images There’s really never a good time to get bad news, but some moments in time do at least seem to be worse than others when it comes to getting bad news. Now is one of those times for the travel industries. The U.S. travel industry has begun receiving a long-and-growing string of bad news reports as it heads into the critical period historically known as the post-summer “shoulder season.” The shoulder season happens every year (well, not last year, but every other year) as summer vacation travel demand predictably dries up. The shoulder season also is when, traditionally, business travel demand stalls, temporarily, as companies, institutions, organizations and entrepreneurs go into planning and preparation mode for their big autumn pushes. Those pushes typically get launched in late September or early October. And though the numbers of people they put on the road in the fall pale in comparison with the numbers of leisure travelers who fill the highways, airplanes, cruise ships and even rails during the typical summer, at least those fall business travelers tend to pay substantially higher fares. But now, in addition to those normal, seasonal swings, the U.S. travel industry is beginning to feel, or at least read about, some additional negative influences on travel demand this fall. They include:   Throw all that on top of the nation’s political divisions and its reaction to the messy withdrawal of America from Afghanistan, and we’ve got a political/cultural/economic zeitgeist going right now that is not likely to be favorable toward the travel industries this fall. U.S. airlines only 45 days ago were predicting reasonably strong profits in the second half of this year even after the peak summer travel season ended. Plus they were touting what they foresaw as gathering momentum for a business travel recovery beginning this fall. Now, however, they may have to eat crow on those forecasts. In fact, several said in early August that the unexpected drop in travel demand that began in mid-July already was threatening their previously publicized expectations of third quarter profits. Worse, off-the-record conversations across the industry have revealed growing concern that the expected big resumption of business travel this fall won’t be as strong or arrive as soon as previously anticipated. We’ll learn more about the drop in late summer demand – and maybe more about the revised outlook for this fall - by the middle of next week. That’s when some airlines are expected to report some, but not all, details about their August operations and their demand expectations for the fall. It’s certainly possible that the decline is not as bad as some across the industry now fret it might be. But it’s just as possible that it could be every bit as disappointing as those individuals fear, or even worse.  Already we’re seeing a significant drop in air travel demand via the Transportation Security Administration’s daily count of people cleared through its airport screening stations. On Tuesday, the TSA screened only 1.35 million. That was the fewest it has screened on any day since May 11.  Thus, you can expect that not only will airline managers be chewing their fingernails to the nubs over the next three or four weeks to see how much demand will fall after Labor Day, but so will hoteliers, restauranteurs and managers of other travel-related businesses. Many in those travel-related industries have been barely holding on during very bad business conditions, and absorbing huge losses, in desperate hopes that business travel – their lifeblood – will pick up significantly this fall. If their hopes are dashed once again this fall, how many will be able to hang on longer - until the Spring at least, or perhaps longer? So, what’s not clear yet – but will be soon enough - is whether the travel industry recovery that seemed to be very much underway only three months ago will merely go through a seasonal valley in the weeks ahead, or fall completely off the rails.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielreed/2021/09/03/is-the-recovery-of-travel-demand-about-to-fizzle-out-or-just-experiencing-a-seasonal-lull/,"Is The Recovery Of Travel Demand About To Fizzle Out, Or Just Experiencing A Seasonal Lull?"
"McLaren is one of the few remaining car companies that hasn’t surrendered (yet) to the SUV craze. The brand which was founded by a New Zealander, Bruce McLaren in 1963 in England, has stayed true to its DNA by getting one thing right: making two-door performance cars, evident in the McLaren P1, Senna or the 720s series. I had a chance to test the newest 720s to see how it compares to its competitors and to its previous model. According to McLaren, the 2021 edition of the 720s  has been renewed by up to 90% from the previous year model, which is impressive taking into account that includes the engine and handling. I could be hyperbolic and brief for this review and just share the verdict upfront without much fanfare: the 720s is one of the top 5 supercars in the world right now, and here is why. The 720s looks utterly sensational from every angle. It brings beauty and awe to everywhere it goes. It is one of the most beautiful cars in the world and that has a lot to do with its sleek and uninterrupted design, boosted by the numerous air intakes that make the 720s stand out from the rest of the supercars like a 2-meter tall guy in Papua New Guinea.  McLaren 720s on the footsteps of the majestic Mont Blanc mountain (France) This car definitely sparks joy in me, and to be honest, to anyone who sees it. The first thing anyone will notice is the outrageous look, which can be quite ominous. It reminds me of the Great white shark or perhaps its predator, the Killer whale chasing prey in the open ocean without losing pace. Clearly, this being a supercar, there is carbon everywhere, in the superbly named Aero spoiler which optically looks ever so satisfying, to the windscreen pillars that are surprisingly thin (opens up the visibility immensely) and there is even carbon on the roof, obviously. All this extra carbon sheds crucial kilos and helps create the supernatural handling of the 720s, and I mean it really feels supernatural. The way the 720s gorges on corners and communicates the road to the driver is beyond anything I’ve experienced before, it’s engineering witchcraft at its best. There are plenty of details for a detail-obsessed geek like me, such as the stunning engine bay which glows theatrically red when the lights are on or the pebble-like key which fits snuggly into the tiny key pocket in the front seat and my favourite, tiny sunglass pocket inside the driver door which remains closed when the doors are up. On the head-turning scale, it definitely matches the Ferrari 488 and the spectacular Lamborghini Huracan, maybe even surpasses them. The inclining low front ground clearance cuts an even more predatory look. I love staring at 720s front lights, which are surrounded by large air intakes that tie together a composed, future proof appearance that will surely remain relevant even 20 years from now. Every bit of this car is just phenomenal to stare at, however, my favourite part of the 720s has to be the rear tail which is sublimely made with intricate details that visualise the power and sound the 720s is capable of producing. Few car brands put so much effort into making the backside so elaborate than McLaren. Large carbon (of course) grills adorn the large exhaust pipes, which are big enough to fit my fist in, by the way, summoned together with one-line tail lights that just look the business. Then there is the main party piece, the reason 50% of buyers go for a McLaren; the dramatic butterfly doors, which swing up gently emitting a subtle swoosh while they open. These doors are not very easy things to make, it requires space program-level engineering and quality control, and above anything else, courage to keep making them when many other car companies have stopped doing so. Entry into the 720s is made comfortable by generous cavities into the roof which helps a human-like me, who is nimble as a hippopotamus, seem almost graceful on entry and exit. These cavities wander into the top of the door that are adorned with glass panels that bring in quite a bit of light inside. It is details like these that make the 720s so attractive and easy to fall in love with. Stunning from every angle Second, there is the performance, which is the Koh-i-noor diamond of the 720s crown. The 710 horsepower 4-litre V8 (midengine) moves this 1400 kilogram two-seater from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds, and to 200 km/h in just under 7 seconds, reaching the top speed of 341 km/h (which we achieved on the German highway) effortlessly. While in the top speed the sound the V8 engine transmits is like being inside the cathedral of Leon (in Spain) with a Formula 1 car from 2008 while AC/DC plays Thunderstruck...heavenly indeed. I’m not sure how it feels to drive a Formula 1 car in 2021, but I would imagine it feels a lot like driving the 720s. One of my favourite sounds in the world is hearing the downshifting of a V8 engine, and the 720s didn’t disappoint. The thunderclap sounds the 720s blasts from downshifting is quite thrilling and is now my ringtone.   There is plenty of power in the 720s, in fact, I don’t see a reason why you should need more than 710 hp, good example is if we compare the 720s to its bigger and more expensive brother the P1, which has only 17 horsepower on the 720s but costs about €1.2 million more. The third is the sublime handling, which is just astronomical and is boosted by an exceptional driving position. I need to highlight the grip again, as it is simply staggering, so much so that it feels more like a four-wheel drive. In fact I had a hard time believing it wasn’t a four-wheel drive. The 720s can be mellow also, well within reason, as in the comfort mode the 720s delivers a fairly comfortable urban driving experience taking into consideration that you are carrying a land fighter jet capable of producing more power than a coal power plant. In the sports mode, however, the 720s opens up the valves and creates more of the joyful sound we are used to hearing from a McLaren while stiffening the suspension and the steering wheel that delivers more precise driving and sportier connection to the road. And then there is the track mode, which realistically should be renamed “Loco mode”. “The Loco” mode starts the show with a little magic trick by revolving the instrument panel into a one-line display that shows only the speed and revolutions. And then you hit the accelerator which unleashes the beast and throws you into every final scene of Mission Impossible movies, you’re only missing Tom Cruise screaming for his dear life on the passenger seat.  The fire and fury that is released by the 710 horsepower engine will leave you for a brief moment breathless as your heart and rest of your organs have outside of the body experience, while the brain forces your face to smile in horror, pleasure and shock all at the same time. The feeling of driving the 720s in track mode is what life is all about, living life to the fullest. Menacing looks It’s not all roses though, the infotainment system is not as advanced or intuitive as a Ferrari or a Porsche, and seat comfort leaves more to be desired and the lack of android auto or apple play is annoying. However, these cons are minuscule compared to their pros. I believe supercars should be also super impressive and continue doing something extraordinary, which the 720s does with its revolving instrument display and those superb flying doors and the concert of the V8 engine. The infotainment system and the interior space (no glovebox..) are the very few areas where the 720s lags behind its competitors, but it does have a generous boot, or should we say fronk (front trunk) space, which took in medium-sized luggage in the front space to our surprise. 720s rear is as gorgeous as the front side The starting price for the 720s is around €260,000, however, our test car had over €100,000 worth of extras making the total price of the test unit a staggering €370,000 ($438,000)... The Porsche 911 Turbo S starting price is at €175,000 (640 hp), Ferrari F8 spider starts at €250,000 with 710 hp and the Lamborghini Huracan Evo starts at €170,000 with 610 hp and the Lamborghini Aventador starts from an eye-watering €350,000 with 729 hp (although that has a bigger 6.5-litre engine). The 720s power and pricing are on par with these breathtaking supercars, however, none of them have butterfly doors and that will forever be your best street credibility trick.  The verdict should not come as a surprise, the McLaren 720s is sensational from every point of view. The sound it emits is heavenly, the performance is absurd and the aesthetics are astounding. If you are considering buying a supercar that performs like a hypercar but won't cost you millions, then the 720s should be on top of your list.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kayvannikjou/2021/09/03/the-mclaren-720s-is-a-cathedral-of-performance-and-aesthetics/,The McLaren 720s Is A Cathedral Of Gorgeous Aesthetics And Mind-blowing Performance

"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.  The original Samsung Galaxy Fold was a bleeding-edge, futuristic product—a screen that folded in half—that was as much about flaunting never-before-seen technology as it is about practical usability. As impressive technically as it was, it was a bit rough around the edges, and I ultimately concluded that only diehard enthusiasts should pay the $2,000 for one.  A year later in 2020, the second-gen Fold 2 made so many major improvements—slimming bezels and making the hinge much sturdier—that I could finally recommend the Fold 2 to smartphone fans.  With this year’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 (the extra Z branding added last year), Samsung clearly aimed to make the foldable more mainstream and accessible, so instead of further chasing big changes, Samsung instead refined and added polish to the foldable.  The result is a phone that feels at first very similar to the Fold 2, but use it for a day or so, and it becomes apparent that the refinements and polish have significantly broadened the foldable phone’s appeal.  The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. The price is still a bit high to call the Fold 3 a mainstream device for the masses, but a lot of the reservations that interested buyers may have had with the last two Folds have been addressed this year.  Design and hardware The Galaxy Z Fold 3 looks and feels like the Galaxy Z Fold 2, so expect a 7.6-inch tablet that folds in the middle like a book to become a narrow, candy bar-shaped smartphone. The Fold 3’s brains got the usual annual processor upgrade to a Snapdragon 888, and the outside (non-folding) screen sees its refresh rate double to 120Hz from last year. The inside screen has a new film material that feels less plasticky than before and more like glass. That’s about it as far as noticeable, tangible differences. The camera system, type of memory used, screen resolution and dimensions remain unchanged from last year's Fold 2.  The Galaxy Z Fold 3 (left) and the Z Fold 2 (right).  The Fold 3 is a hair lighter, narrower and thinner, but it’s not really noticeable unless you grab one phone right after the other. If you’ve held a Fold 2, you already know how the Fold 3 feels in the hand. This is not a bad thing: I love the versatility of the Fold 3 (and Fold 2). When closed, it’s a small phone I can use with one hand easily. Unfolded, it’s a small tablet that shows more information than any smartphone.  The Galaxy Z Fold 3 when folded.  The Galaxy Z Fold 3 unfolded.  But as mentioned, Samsung did, in fact, bring practical refinements that don’t immediately show themselves. For example, the aluminum used to construct the hinge and frame of the phone is stronger, according to Samsung. That aforementioned new film material is also supposedly more durable and scratch resistance than last year's.  The Fold 3 also gains official water resistance and stylus support. The former is an IPX8 rating, meaning the phone can be submerged under water for up to 30 minutes without problems. Stylus support, meanwhile, only works on the inside folding screen, and requires a separate purchase of new styluses Samsung built exclusively for the Fold 3.  Both of these are feats of incredible hardware engineering previously thought impossible: a folding phone with moving parts and an open hinge that is water-proof? A soft, plastic folding screen that can survive being poked around by a stylus?  The Galaxy Z Fold 3 with S-Pen support. Samsung made one more practical improvement: it managed to lower the price of the Fold 3 to $1,800 in the U.S. and HK$14,598 in Hong Kong, this is roughly 10% cheaper than the previous two Folds at launch.  Officially Samsung says they managed to lower the price due to being more efficient at production and assembly, but realistically, I know it's also because the Fold 3 reused the exact same camera hardware from last year. This camera system—a triple 12-megapixel lens setup—is pretty good in a vacuum, but falls way short of the standards set by top slab phones like Samsung's own S21 Ultra or Xiaomi's Mi 11 Ultra. Even in the foldable space, the Fold 3's cameras fall behind the Huawei Mate X2.  But this is a smart move on Samsung's part because lowering the price of a foldable while making it more durable is going to increase mainstream appeal. To most people, the saving and added durability is more important than having a better zoom camera. Software One of my biggest gripes with Apple's stubborn iOS software is that it runs exactly the same across all of its iPhones big and small. This means if you upgrade from a 5.4-inch iPhone 12 Mini to a 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max, you're not actually seeing more content, just the same content in bigger size. Likewise, Apple made absolutely no adjustments in UX (user experience) for the larger Max screen. The same buttons that are placed in the upper left corners of a small iPhone is still in the upper left corner of a huge iPhone.  Samsung, thankfully, doesn't subscribe to Apple's peculiar draconian software quirks. Samsung made a myriad of changes to the Fold 3's user experience to accommodate the large and folding screen. For example, the Fold 3, like last year’s Fold 2, can fold halfway to become a laptop-shaped device. Samsung has designed many apps to take advantage of this unique form factor. For example, in the camera app, the viewfinder will move to the upper half of the screen, with the bottom half (the base) showing controls. In YouTube, the video will move to the upper half, leaving the bottom half free to show comments.  The Fold 3 can fold only halfway and sit open like a laptop.  This form is very useful, as the Fold 3 can essentially serve as its own tripod/stand, allowing hands-free selfies, video calls.  Elsewhere, most first party Samsung apps, as well as the user interface within the phone will adjust to the larger screen size, showing more multi-pane panels and information.  S-Pen support To use a stylus with the Fold 3, you will have to buy a new S-Pen (Samsung’s official name for its stylus) released just for the Fold 3. Due to the nature of the folding screen, Samsung had to use a different Wacom digitizer underneath the panel, so previous Samsung S-Pens will not work.  There are two models for the Fold 3, a $99 S-Pen Pro and a $49 S-Pen Fold Edition. The Fold Edition is more compact and only works for the Fold 3; the Pro is a longer model that works for the Fold 3 plus all existing Samsung products that support the stylus.  The S-Pen Pro attempting to draw over the crease in the Fold 3's folding display.  I only tested the Pro model, but the stylus experience is good but not without flaws that come naturally with a foldable display. Latency is low, pressure sensitivity is good, and the Pro has built-in Bluetooth so it can be used as a remote control for the phone. But the slight indentations in the crease can get in the way of pen strokes.  I can see the S-Pen experience enhancing the Fold 3 as a do-it-all productivity machine.  Under-screen camera There’s one headline grabbing part of the Fold 3 I haven’t mentioned until here: the Fold 3’s inner screen features an under-screen camera. I didn’t bother mentioning this until now because quite frankly, the camera isn’t very good. It’s a 4-megapixel sensor, so it’s not the sharpest photo, and Samsung’s implementation does not hide the camera nearly as well as Xiaomi. When the camera not in use, you can still see an outline of the camera flickering underneath the screen. The under-screen selfie camera. However, there is one big caveat: the Fold 3 has two selfie cameras. So even though the under-screen selfie camera is below par, there’s still the normal 10-megapixel selfie camera on the outside screen that does a good job. So this is a non-issue for me. Samsung found the right place to experiment new tech: a secondary backup selfie camera.  Overall performance With a Snapdragon 888 and 12GB of RAM, the Fold 3 performs like the premium flagship phone that it is. Both the smaller outside screen and the inside folding screen are sharp, vivid, and refreshes at 120Hz for buttery smooth animations.  The Fold 3's outside cover display.  The cameras are capable, but the zoom lens lag behind the Periscope zoom lenses seen in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra.  A sample image captured by the Fold 3. Another sample image captured by the Fold 3.  The Fold 3’s design also makes for a more fun shooting experience, such as the aforementioned ability of the phone to prop itself up for hands-free group photos. You can also use the main camera system to take selfies when it’s unfolded because there is a screen on both sides of the phone.  Conclusion: a refined foldable experience  Despite the fact that I am slightly disappointed by the Fold 3’s cameras, the phone is overall still the most polished and exciting smartphone release of the year so far, because the Fold 3 really changes the way most of us will use a phone.  The Fold 3's large 7.6-inch screen running three apps at once.  I am more productive when using the Fold 3 (and the Fold 2 before it) than when I’m on a normal slab phone. The larger screen lets me run two apps side-by-side, and editing documents on the go is less straining on the eyes.  A render of the Z Fold 3.  The biggest concerns foldable skeptics have had with foldables is that they’re more fragile and expensive than traditional phones. Samsung has addressed both of these concerns: the Fold 3 uses stronger materials all around, is water-proofed, and cheaper than before. This is almost unheard of in smartphones the past few years, as phones have only become more and more expensive. If you’ve been curious about foldable technology, this new generation of Samsung foldables may just be convincing enough. For me? I’ve been sold since day one.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2021/09/03/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-the-most-polished-well-rounded-foldable-yet/,"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 Review: The Most Polished, Well-Rounded Foldable Yet"
"New Zealand authorities on Friday said they shot and killed a knife-wielding attacker who stabbed six people in a supermarket in the city of Auckland, in what is being identified as the country’s first terrorist incident since the 2019 attack on a mosque in Christchurch by a far-right extremist.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the attacker was an “ISIS-inspired known threat” who was already under police surveillance. Police were following the man after he left home and walked into a supermarket on Friday, where he picked up a knife from a shelf and carried out the attack. New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the attacker was shot and killed by police within 60 seconds. Despite being known as a probable threat the attacker could not be kept in prison under New Zealand law, Ardern added. According to the New Zealand Herald, three of the six victims are in critical condition in the hospital. “It was hateful, it was wrong. It was carried out by an individual, not a faith. He alone carries the responsibility for these acts,” Ardern said in her briefing. The attack took place around 2:40 pm local time in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, which is currently under a strict lockdown as it battles a community outbreak of Covid-19. Under the lockdown rules, most businesses are shut but the “Countdown” supermarket where the attack took place remains open as people are allowed to step out to buy groceries and other essentials. While the name of the attacker has not been made public, he has been identified as a Sri Lankan national, who had been living in New Zealand for the past 10 years.

The decision will allow the LDP to elect a new leader ahead of November’s general elections. The winner of the intra-party election is expected to take over from Suga as the country’s new Prime Minister as the LDP holds a majority in the Japanese parliament. 29%. That’s the approval rating of Suga’s cabinet that was reported last month by national broadcaster NHK. Suga and his cabinet’s approval rating began to take a hit earlier this year as Covid cases rose across Japan and it slumped further following his government’s decision to allow the Tokyo Olympics to go ahead despite public health concerns. Suga took office in September last year after his predecessor Shinzo Abe resigned due to health concerns. Initially, Suga and his cabinet enjoyed approval ratings as high as 70%. Suga’s initial popularity was boosted by the fact that he was the son of a farmer from northern Japan and not a part of Japan’s political elite. But Suga’s ratings began to free fall earlier this year as Covid-19 cases began to rise across Japan. His government’s pandemic measures were seen as too slow and inadequate to prevent the surge in cases and support for him slid further when the government decided to allow the Tokyo Olympics to take place against the advice of public health officials.

"Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, reacts after hitting Tallon Griekspoor, of the Netherlands, with the ball ... [+] while returning a shot during the second round of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Two down, five to go for Novak Djokovic. The world No. 1 from Serbia advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open on Thursday night and now stands just five match-wins from joining an exclusive club of Grand Slam champions. Djokovic, 34, is seeking to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 and the sixth tennis player ever to capture all four major titles in the same calendar year. If he wins the title on Sept. 12, he would also surpass rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal with a men’s record 21st major title. After disposing of Dutch No. 1 Tallon Griekspoor, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Djokovic gave a wide-ranging, in-depth interview with ESPN’s Chris McKendry in which he touched on several subjects, including the “mental advantage” he feels he has over many opponents, the “excitement” and “pressure” he’s feeling in New York and how Federer and Nadal helped put him in this position. “Most of the opponents that you get to play if you’re at the top of the game, you know that already before coming into the match, you have a mental advantage,” Djokovic, winner of eight of the last 12 major titles, said after his 23rd straight Grand Slam victory of 2021.  “But at the same time, it can go [the] other way where they don’t have much to lose and you’re too stressing about expectations and stuff that are going around the court. Pressure, we all have it, but top guys, especially for me here with pressure on the line. Pressure is huge but at the same time I thrive on that. I like that because there’s a sign ‘Pressure is a privilege’ — a quote by Billie Jean [King] — and I truly believe and I live by that. So it’s an honor to be in this situation.” Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, serves to Tallon Griekspoor, of the Netherlands, during the second round ... [+] of the US Open tennis championships, Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Djokovic next faces Kei Nishikori of Japan, who took out American Mackie McDonald in five tough sets. Djokovic is 17-2 against Nishikori, although the Japanese star beat the Serb in the 2014 U.S. Open semifinals en route to the final. Djokovic beat Nishikori, 6-2, 6-0, in their last meeting in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo Olympics before Djokovic lost to Sascha Zverev in the semis. “We had some battles, particularly on the hardcourts,” Djokovic said.  Going forward, Djokovic could face No. 6 Matteo Berrettini, the Wimbledon runner-up, in the quarterfinals, Olympic gold medalist Zverev in the semis and potentially world No. 2 Daniil Medvedev in the final. Medvedev said his goal is to prevent Djokovic from winning the Grand Slam. “We’re here to not let him win the U.S. Open,” he said. Against Griekspoor, Djokovic was heckled by a few fans and seemed distracted at times. In his first-round match against 18-year-old qualifier Holger Rune, fans cheered “Rune” and against Djokovic. The Serb said it’s important to “stay in the zone” and to not to get distracted by anything — presumably including the fans — during his pursuit of history. “It’s important to bounce back very quickly, not to allow this distraction to last for a long time because tennis is a game of nuances,” he said. “Very few details and moments can decide a winner.” Still, Djokovic is focused on the task at hand and keen to make history. He said he recently went to Forest Hills, site of the old U.S. Open, and felt “really inspired.”  He knows that players like Martina Navratilova (1984) and Serena Williams (2015) won the first three legs of the Grand Slam, but failed to complete the mission. Navratilova actually won six straight majors — the last three of 1983 and the first three of ‘84. “It’s important to know the history as a tennis player because they’ve built the foundation that we are standing on today,” Djokovic said. “Being only in the conversation with Rod Laver, with Martina, with Serena, with Billie Jean, the all-time greats of our sports is really an honor for me. I try to draw strength and motivation from that... “Of course with history on the line, the excitement grows, the pressure grows, but experience and understanding of what I have ot do on a daily basis in order to reach the goal allows me to still be in the tournament.” Djokovic added that tennis is a “magnificent” sport and that “I think it’s the third most popular sport on the planet, over a billion people watch it, I’ve seen some stats. I guess they’re accurate, hopefully.” “It’s just amazing to be on a Grand Slam,” he added. “Grand Slams are historically the ones that have mattered the most for us so I’ve been really fortunate to play my best tennis in Grand Slams over the years.” Novak Djokovic, of Serbia, returns a shot to Tallon Griekspoor, of the Netherlands, during the ...

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Djokovic has previously won the “Nole Slam” in 2016 when he held all four majors at once after winning his first Grand Slam. “That’s where I first felt, OK this is reachable, it’s achievable. I can even do it in one year,” he said. “I always believed that I have a very good chance to win every Slam on every surface because I developed over the years my game to be really an all-around game that can adapt to any game or any conditions. “But in that moment, where I won French in 2016, it’s where I really started to really believe that it can become a reality one day that I can win it all in one year. And Roger and Rafa did not manage to do that, but they were very close. Roger played finals of French Open a couple years and he won all the other Slams. Rafa as well. These two guys and their dominance on the tour have made me the player I am today, without a doubt.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/09/02/novak-djokovic-says-he-has-a-mental-advantage-over-most-of-his-opponents-as-he-pursues-the-grand-slam/,Novak Djokovic Says He Has A ‘Mental Advantage’ Over Most Of His Opponents As He Pursues The Grand Slam
"JT Rooney Two months ago I interviewed J.T. Rooney of XR Studios.  I remember the date well because it was the day when California reopened fully, and all of us thought we were one step closer to putting the pandemic into the rear view mirror.  In life as in extended reality, things are not always what they appear to be.  Covid has once again turned for the worse, but technology continues its unabated march forward. J.T. comes from a background of live entertainment having worked with Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Katy Perry.  He has a calm and steady presence, critical when you’re working in the junction between live performance and merging of performance and technological enhancements. This story has taken me some time to digest because it is truly about the next evolution in performing arts: merging live performance with pre-produced imagery in real time.  The speed of computing power allows for the insertion of complex visuals and text while a live performance is taking place, at broadcast quality levels of integration.  There are so many features being enabled and stacked that I had a truly difficult time thinking through just what that meant technically. The work XR Studios is doing is the equivalent of living in a sci-fi movie.  J.T. and the team use LED screens to construct a shell, including a LED floor and augmented reality technology all tied to a camera with a fixed focal point on the live performer.  As the performer moves, the camera tracks the movement causing the technology to shifts the displays around always maintaining the illusion the performer is within the world which is represented on the screens.  This allows for endless variations of how to put a real person into an artificial universe.  And, once inside that universe, size and space become irrelevant.  You can be made as small as a pixel or as large as the solar system, and the graphics surrounding adjust seamlessly.   In addition, this technology can be used to enhance a live performance on stage, while delivering a different and more comprehensive streamed view of the event to those watching remotely on screens. The purpose of this tech to enhance storytelling and compel attention, as now almost any performance competes with social media, and the endless magnetic dopamine seeking behavior of almost anyone in possession of a smart phone. The same technology can be used to enhance speakers at a live conference, allowing a more integrated way to deliver data points visually while incorporating the speaker who is at the front of the room and relieving the audience from the tedium of power point slides.  It’s also capable of “transporting” people, by knitting together onto a single screen someone who is onsite with someone who is halfway across the globe, much like the satellite interviews now seen often on cable news.  However, with a little bit of preproduction planning, the final production which is seen will appear to be that of two or more people in the same space. XR worked on the Kid Cudi video produced by his team for Amazon Prime 
  
  AMZN 
  day, placing Kid Cudi into space in support of his song Man On the Moon. Because XR Studios is creatively agnostic, they implement the design which is brought to them by the production designers working for the artists who use XR’s facilities.  XR provides guidance and helps to technically execute the recording, which is how Kid Cudi would wind up on the moon during his portion of the Amazon Prime day event. As another example, XR worked on the Billie Eilish live stream which was fully integrated with their augmented reality.  After days of rehearsal, when the go live time arrived, Billie performed while the XR tech merged her image with that which was built for the event, in real time, and streamed around the world.  The beauty of extended reality is that once the preproduction work is done, the camera turns on and the finished product is filmed and streamed live.  Like all things tech, there is always a risk that something might go wrong, but after all, isn’t that the fun of live. It’s not perfectly predictable and that slight undercurrent of “this might go off the rails” adds a certain frission. My conversation with J.T. Rooney is here in both video and audio podcast format:   Every bit of this is fascinating.  Stay tuned.  I plan to get back to J.T. soon to find out just what else can be accomplished by adding massive computing power to a performer’s ability to compel attention from their audience.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericfuller/2021/09/02/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-extended-reality--xr-studios-is-where-live-performance-enters-the-metaverse/,Down The Rabbit Hole Of Extended Reality – XR Studios Is Where Live Performance Enters The Metaverse
"An American Airlines mechanic connects an aircraft to a power source. The International Association of Machinists and the Transport Workers Union have beaten back an outsider union’s attempt to raid American Airlines 
  
  AAL 
 ’ 14,402 mechanics. The failure of the attempted raid by Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, known as AMFA, was revealed Thursday in an 18-page ruling by the National Mediation Board, which considered 19 AMFA challenges regarding which workers should be included in the bargaining unit. Currently, American mechanics are represented by an association of the TWU and the IAM. Before a 2013 merger between American and US Airways, TWU represented American mechanics and IAM represented US Airways mechanics. AMFA, which began its raid in November 2019, represents only mechanics, while IAM and TWU represent not only mechanics but also fleet service workers, flight simulator engineers, cleaners and other groups. AMFA argued that limited representation is better for workers, while IAM and TWU said more workers provide unions with more power in negotiations. “If organized labor had a court of justice, bottom feeding-AMFA would be charged with high crimes and treason against workers,” TWU President John Samuelsen said late Thursday. “This is a victory for blue collar workers and also for the security of U.S. airline passengers, because if AMFA had succeeded, a lot of maintenance work would soon be done on foreign soil,” said Samuelsen, referring to an AMFA negotiating practice of trading off some union jurisdiction in return for higher wages. Sito Pantoja, IAM’s longtime transportation department leader president who now oversees an organizing initiative, said, “This is great for organized labor. The TWU and IAM showed AMFA the exit door at the NMB. “AMFA is full of rhetoric but offers nothing concrete,” Pantoja said. “We knew from the beginning they didn’t have enough support. They never had enough support on the US Airways and American (properties) and they never will.” Bret Oestreich, AMFA national director, did not immediately respond to a phone call or an email. In the ruling, NMB did not specify how many signatures AMFA obtained during its organizing drive. For NMB to conduct an election, AMFA would have needed to obtain signatures from 50% plus one member of the bargaining unit. Ken MacTiernan, an AMFA organizer, said he questions the NMB decision because AMFA filed 7,755 cards, more than enough to ensure an election. “They have not told us who was not eligible or what cards were removed or why they were removed,” he said.  MacTiernan, an American mechanic in San Diego, also challenged the use of the word “raid” to describe AMFA’s effort.  He said that the word “revolt” should be substituted, because AMFA supporters revolted against the association, an umbrella organization of the two elected unions, and then sought out AMFA as a representative. The effort came just months after the TWU/IAM association negotiated an industry leading $4.2 billion contract covering 31,000 American workers. AMFA began its raid in November 2019 and, because signatures are only valid for a year, faced the risk of losing some if it did not file by November 2020. In its conclusion, NMB wrote, “The investigation established that AMFA failed to support its application with the required number of authorization cards from the employees in the craft or class. Therefore, the board finds no basis upon which to proceed in this matter and the application is hereby dismissed.” Besides raising jurisdiction questions, AMFA also alleged that American Airlines interfered in its card collection effort. But the NMB said that “except in extraordinary circumstances, the NMB will only investigate allegations of election interference when filed by participants after the tally,” and that “No extraordinary circumstances are present in this case.” The NMB investigator found 14,403 potential eligible voters. Despite AMFA’s various objections, the investigator removed just one employee from the list that American submitted. Perusal of the NMB ruling makes clear some of the complex intricacies of labor law. On Dec. 4, 2020, American filed a list of 13,213 potential eligible voters, the ruling said. Two names were duplicative, so the number was reduced to 13,211. Then TWU/IAM challenged the list, saying it should include about 2,000 additional workers, including 656 fleet service employees who worked preponderantly in the mechanic craft; 496 furloughed employees; 397 employees who were on “pay continuation status” after selecting a future separation date; 158 employees on authorized leaves of absences; 135 flight simulator engineers and 28 terminated employees who still had pending grievances. Most of the investigator’s decisions went in favor of TWU/IAM. One of the jurisdictional disputes involved deceased workers. Of 13 workers alleged to be deceased, one died before the cut-off date, resulting in an uncounted vote, but eight died after the cut-off date, so they remained on the list. Others said that “the mechanics and related craft or class,” as defined by labor law, includes 250 “tow team” employee, engaged in aircraft movement; 177 fleet service workers engaged in deicing work, and 90 fleet service employees engaged in lavatory service. The NMB generally defined who is included in the mechanics and related employee class in a 1947 case involving National Airlines. In the past 74 years, little about the definitions has changed, the ruling noted.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2021/09/02/top-two-airline-unions-beat-back-raid-on-american-airlines-mechanics/,Top Two Airline Unions Beat Back Raid On American Airlines Mechanics
"ByteDance, TikTok’s China–based parent company, became the second social media giant to buy a VR company. Right after we published our round up last Friday, rumors started to swirl around ByteDance buying VR HMD maker Pico. On Monday it was confirmed. The social media giant dropped 5 billion Yuan (~$775 M USD) on Pico, which is the third largest of the four main VR HMD companies (the first two are Facebook and Sony, the fourth is HTC). Pico is the number one headset in China, with inroads in enterprise use in the west. Tik Tok is growing faster than Facebook at this point, having recently become the second mobile app with over three billion downloads. Pico had raised $62 million in venture funding, including a recent $37 million Series B in March. Clearly both ByteDance and Facebook think VR is the next social media platform. Will Pico and Oculus split the market by geography? Go head to head?

"The leaders of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies will pay around $7 billion in penalties and back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, a massive settlement following years of tax-related disputes. James Simons from Renaissance Technologies listens during a House Oversight and Government Reform ... [+] Committee hearing on November 13, 2008. Several current and former members of Renaissance’s board and investors in one of its funds will pay back taxes to the IRS, including founder Jim Simons — whose net worth Forbes estimates at $25.4 billion — and former co-CEO Robert Mercer, according to a letter to investors penned by the firm’s current CEO Peter Brown and obtained by Bloomberg and the Journal. The settlement could total $7 billion, the Journal, the New York Times and the Financial Times reported, and Brown’s letter said Simons agreed to pay the IRS an additional settlement of $670 million. The settlement focuses on the tax treatment of trades made by Renaissance’s Medallion fund, which is not open to outside investors. Brown told investors the firm engaged in the IRS’s appeals process for several years, but eventually decided a settlement would be less risky than entering into litigation with federal tax authorities. A Renaissance spokesperson did not respond to Forbes’ request for comment. Founded by Simons nearly 40 years ago, Renaissance is often regarded as one of the world’s most successful trading firms, achieving annualized returns of roughly 66% over the last three decades. In 2014, U.S. Senate investigators suggested Renaissance and other firms used financial instruments called “basket options” to turn short-term profits into long-term capital gains, for which the IRS charges a lower tax rate. A Senate report estimated Renaissance’s tax savings for this arrangement at $6.8 billion. Renaissance executives told the Senate in 2014 they believed their activities “were and are appropriate under current law.” Simons and Mercer are both politically active, but on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Simons has donated extensively to Democratic candidates and political action committees, and Mercer has donated to Republicans.

"Zendesk, the San Francisco-based customer support software company with Danish roots, has grown from offering a simple helpdesk tool to becoming a major force in the world of customer support software, exceeding $1 Billion in revenue in 2020. [For my Forbes stories on Zendesk stablemates in the lively SaaS customer support software space, here I cover Dixa, another Danish company—must be something about that Danish Hygge; Nextiva and its new NextOS; Gladly, also based in San Francisco and owned in part by JetBlue, and Freshworks, a California company with Indian roots that just filed for its own IPO.] Earlier this year, Jeff Titterton, a veteran of startups as well as graphics leader Adobe, was named chief operating officer, a position he rose to after four years with the company.  [Author's disclosure: some years ago, I served as the keynote speaker for the multi-city Zendesk Customer Service Hero Tour.] I spoke with Titterton about his own journey as well as Zendesk's. Micah Solomon, Forbes senior contributor and customer experience consultant: Was there something in your background that led you to decide to join Zendesk?  Jeff Titterton, Chief Operating Officer, Zendesk: I spent the first half of my career in tech startups. It was there that I observed the Zendesk launch and watched as the companies I worked for came to adopt Zendesk as their central command zone for  Jeff Titterton, Chief Operating Officer, Zendesk communicating with customers. After leaving the startup world, I moved to Adobe, where I led engagement marketing for its Creative Cloud offering as the company transitioned to a SaaS model. Talk about a big challenge; to create a clean and customer-friendly experience with a disparate team. Adobe was able to navigate through this successfully over time. However, it was more challenging than we anticipated due to the complexities that many enterprise companies often face, such as multiple customer communication systems, different and competing data sources, etc. What appealed to me most about Zendesk was that it had begun bringing simplicity and ease of use beloved by smaller companies to the larger and more complex problems of mid and large-sized companies. Without the right technology, a company can't recognize, much less empathize with, their customers or possibly hope to identify problems with their customer experience. Zendesk was helping companies solve these big problems through a lens of customer-centricity that appealed to me. After experiencing first-hand the kinds of tough problems that Zendesk's solutions could solve, the decision to join the company was easy. Solomon: Now that you're at Zendesk, do you find you're bringing a particular perspective to the mix? Titterton: My focus has been on building engaging relationships with our customers and making sure my team's decisions are made with customers always at the center.  With my recent move to Chief Operating Officer, I am keeping the same customer-first lens as we bring our product, customer advocacy, startups, SMB, and business analytics and operations teams closer together. My team's mission is two-fold: to continue to drive growth and to eliminate friction in the way we do business, whether it's for a small startup buying a few licenses or a global enterprise of tens of thousands of people.  Solomon: Zendesk has reinvented itself several times since you used it as a customer. Can you talk about some of those changes?  Titterton: Zendesk has evolved significantly since I first used it as a simple help desk tool over a decade ago. Customers today have much more power, more information and more options than ever. Over the past few years, we've launched multiple new solutions, including Zendesk Sunshine, our CRM platform to connect all customer data. We've also branched out of our customer service roots and launched Zendesk Sell, our sales tool with a simple design made to reduce friction for salespeople.  But where we've doubled down recently is with our new integrated messaging solutions. Messaging channels, including both social messaging and native messaging, are the fastest-growing channels for customer service; they are exploding in usage as consumers increasingly use messaging as their go-to form of communication with friends, family, and businesses. We believe messaging is the new frontier of customer service, and our messaging tools are designed to enable businesses to provide connected conversational experiences across web, mobile, and social channels.  Solomon: Along those lines, what's coming up next for Zendesk? Titterton: At the end of 2020, we crossed the $1 billion revenue target, something that only a handful of other SaaS companies have achieved. Crossing that threshold was a big moment of celebration for us. We've now set our sights on becoming a multi-billion-dollar company by building and evolving our products for our customers to help them grow their business and better serve their customers. We will continue to lean more into messaging as a service, and we are also focusing on expanding and enhancing our product offering to meet the complex needs of enterprises. Our largest enterprise customers are our fastest-growing segment, and their complicated workflows and requirements require us to offer better integrations, better extensibility, and more flexibility. We're focused on building what they need, in a very Zendesk way.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2021/09/02/beyond-billion-dollar-customer-service-zendesks-new-coo-shares-his-vision/,Beyond Billion-Dollar Customer Service: Zendesk’s New COO Shares His Vision
" Two of the most popular dating apps in the U.S., Match and Bumble, are kick-starting funds to help Texans access abortion services in the wake of a controversial new anti-abortion law that effectively bans the procedure after six weeks, before many have even realized they’re pregnant. Bumber founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd attends a company event in 2018. CEO Shar Dubey, whose Match Group Inc. operates Match.com, the largest dating site in the country, told employees Thursday in an internal memo that she has set up a fund for workers affected by the new legislation. The Dallas-based company’s fund will help cover costs for workers and their dependents who need to travel out-of-state in order to have an abortion, Dubey said in the memo first reported by Bloomberg. Austin-based Bumble, the second-most-downloaded dating app in the U.S., announced Wednesday it would launch a fund to support people trying to access abortion services in Texas. Bumble said that the company will lend its support in fighting Texas’ new abortion legislation, which it called “regressive” in a statement. With its low taxes and affordability, Texas bills itself as a business-friendly state and has attracted companies like Tesla, Apple, Oracle and Hewlett Packard to either open offices in or relocate to the state. A recent poll indicates Texas may lose out on skilled workers over the state’s new restrictive abortion policy. According to a PerryUndem poll released this week, two thirds of workers with college educations said they would not take a job in a state that bars abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, like Texas’ new law effectively does.  “I immigrated to America from India over 25 years ago . . . I am shocked that I now live in a state where women’s reproductive laws are more regressive than most of the world, including India,” Dubey said in the memo Thursday. “Surely everyone should see the danger of this highly punitive and unfair law . . . I would hate for our state to take this big step back in women’s rights.” Texas’ new abortion legislation was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott in May, but did not take effect until Wednesday. The law bans abortion after what the bill interprets as signs of a fetal heartbeat are detected, which can be picked up at about six weeks using a vaginal ulstrasound. However, medical experts dispute that what ultrasounds pick up that early into a pregnancy is actually a heartbeat, saying it’s more likely the twitching of tissue that will later develop into a heart as it’s “electronically induced” by the ultrasound machine. Banning abortion after six weeks, before many people realize they’re pregnant, will make about 85% of abortions ineligible under the new Texas law, experts say. The legislation allows private citizens to enforce the law by suing anyone involved in helping procure an abortion in civil court for up to $10,000. Abortion is a safe and common medical procedure that nearly one in four women will undergo before turning 45, according to a 2017 study from the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice think tank.  Texas Now Has The Most Restrictive Abortion Law In The U.S.—Here’s What Could Happen Next (Forbes) Biden Vows Action Against Texas Abortion Ban With ‘Whole-Of-Government Effort’ (Forbes) Florida Lawmakers Suggest They’ll Copy Texas’ Abortion Ban—And Other GOP States Will Likely Follow (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/09/02/bumble-match-launch-funds-to-cover-abortion-costs-in-texas/,"Bumble, Match Launch Funds To Cover Abortion Costs In Texas"
"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Thursday she opposes the Supreme Court’s decision to leave in place a Texas law banning nearly all abortions, as critics pointed to her support for Justice Brett Kavanaugh as pivotal for the decision.

(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Collins said in a statement to Forbes the Texas law, which bans abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, before most women realize they are pregnant, is “extreme and harmful,” adding she opposes the Supreme Court’s decision. Collins noted the majority opinion by the Court’s five most conservative justices does not address the law’s constitutionality – rather, it said it was too soon to tell if the state “can or will seek to enforce the Texas law… in a manner that might permit our intervention.” Collins nonetheless said the Court should block the law from taking effect “while these underlying constitutional and procedural questions are litigated” by lower courts. In the wake of the decision, critics highlighted Collins’ 2018 vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who voted with the majority on Wednesday, and her stated confidence that his confirmation wouldn’t lead to the Court overturning abortion rights. Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) were also the lone GOP votes last year against confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was also in the majority, though she grounded her opposition in the timing of the vote rather than Barrett’s views. Collins was one of the deciding votes on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, along with Murkowski Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). In a nearly hour-long speech she expressed confidence Kavanaugh would not vote to overturn landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, arguing he believes justices are “constitutionally dictated to pay attention” to precedent. ""I think that a lot of people on the left and pundits have been wrong about how the court has respected precedent. We’ll have to see… I think they would look at precedent,” Collins said in a CNN interview last month when asked about the possibility of the court overturning Roe. 7. That’s the number of Supreme Court justices serving on the bench that Collins has voted on since entering the Senate.

"Transgender people are twice as likely to die as cisgender people, according to a long running study published in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology on Thursday, a difference researchers said underscores the need for improving social acceptance and medical care for trans people.   Trans people are twice as likely to die than cisgender people, according to a Dutch study.  The increased risk did not fall over the almost five decades studied between 1972 and 2018, according to an analysis of medical records from nearly 3,000 trans women and more than 1,600 trans men treated at the Amsterdam University Medical Center, which treats around 90% of trans people in the country.  Trans women had particularly elevated risks of death—notably from heart disease, lung cancer, HIV-related illness and suicide—the researchers noted, and were almost twice as likely to die than cis men and nearly three times as likely to die than cis women.  There were no differences in the risks of death between trans and cisgender men, the study found, though the group was almost twice as likely to die than cis women, especially from non-natural causes like suicide.  The researchers said the findings add weight to the idea that the health disparities observed in transgender people are not primarily driven by gender-affirming hormone treatment—which can potentially increase the likelihood of some conditions—as most causes of increased death identified have no indication of being a consequence of this.  Lead author Martin den Heijer said bolstering social acceptance and improving healthcare for trans people, particularly for heart disease, tobacco use, and HIV, will be important for decreasing the risk of death, adding that further research will be needed to “fully establish” any long-term risk to hormone treatment. It is well documented that transgender  and gender non-conforming people, particularly trans women, have much higher risks of death and illness than the general population. Hormone therapy has been identified as a possible, though not definite, contributor towards this. Trans adults are at a much greater risk of dealing with suicidal thoughts and attempting suicide than cisgender adults, as well as more likely to experience homelessness, violence and discrimination.   As the study is observational and based on medical records, it is possible other factors not recorded could have contributed towards the higher death rates in transgender people. The authors stress caution when applying its findings to other regions, which may use different kinds of gender-affirming hormone treatment and the 90% white study group. In a linked comment, Emory University’s Dr. Vin Tangpricha, who was not involved in the study, said gender-affirming hormone treatment for trans women in the U.S. and U.K. typically differs and could raise different safety concerns.     First author Christel de Blok said most suicides and deaths related to HIV in the study occurred in the first decades studied, “suggesting that greater social acceptance and access to support, and improved treatments for HIV, may have played an important role in reducing deaths related to these causes among transgender people in recent years.” Mortality trends over five decades in adult transgender people receiving hormone treatment: a report from the Amsterdam cohort of gender dysphoria  (The Lancet)  Coronavirus Economy Especially Harsh for Transgender People (NYT) 2021 on pace to be deadliest yet for trans and gender non-conforming Americans (Guardian) A Beginner's Guide to Hormone Replacement Therapy (Vice) If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/09/02/transgender-people-twice-as-likely-to-die-as-cisgender-people-study-finds/,"Transgender People Twice As Likely To Die As Cisgender People, Study Finds"
"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - AUGUST 27: Stray Kids attends 2019 Soribada Best K-Music Awards at Olympic Park ... [+] KSPO DOME in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images) South Korean all-male vocal band Stray Kids aren’t just back with new music, they’re enjoying perhaps their biggest and best week ever on the Billboard charts. The group’s sophomore full-length Noeasy launches at No. 5 on the World Albums ranking, bringing the act back to the top 10 for the milestone tenth time. While that’s a big win for them, it’s over on the World Digital Song Sales chart where they really succeed and demonstrate their power.  This week, Stray Kids fill seven spots on the World Digital Song Sales chart, which only features 25 rungs. That means that the eight-member group claims more than a quarter of all available real estate on the competitive ranking. They aren’t the first to manage this showing, but it does highlight that they are among the biggest and most successful names in the K-pop industry reaching a large audience in the U.S. Just one of Stray Kids’ seven current charting hits finds its way inside the top 10, as new single “Thunderous” starts at No. 3. The tune earns the loftiest debut of the week, coming in behind only Wizkid, Tems and Justin Bieber’s “Essence” (No. 1) and BTS’s resurging “2! 3!” (No. 2). The band has now reached the highest tier on the tally with at least 14 songs, and they are sure to add to that sum when they have more music to share. New cut “Domino” narrowly misses out on becoming another top 10 for Stray Kids, as it launches at No. 11. Also present inside the top 20 this time around are fellow new cuts “Cheese” (No. 14) and “The View” (No. 18). Six of the Stray Kids tracks present on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart are new, while one former smash returns. “Wolfgang,” which re-enters the tally at No. 23, previously topped out at No. 4, and it has now spent just two frames on the list. Stray Kids are the most successful act on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart, at least when looking at the number of spaces they fill. They have enjoyed massive frames before, where they’ve filled more than a few spots, and this may become a commonplace sight for them, as their American fans clearly have no issue opening their wallets to support the band. Here is where all of Stray Kids’ tracks rank on this week’s World Digital Song Sales chart. No. 3 - “Thunderous” No. 11 - “Domino” No. 14 - “Cheese” No. 18 - “The View” No. 22 - “Ssick” No. 23 - “Wolfgang” No. 24 - “Sorry, I Love You”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/02/stray-kids-dominate-one-quarter-of-billboards-world-songs-chart-with-a-wave-of-new-hits/,Stray Kids Dominate One-Quarter Of Billboard’s World Songs Chart With A Wave Of New Hits
"After spending his entire 20-year career with the Yankees, Derek Jeter was an overwhelming choice ... [+] for the Baseball Hall of Fame. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) Derek Jeter’s Hall of Fame speech is missing in action.  “They told me I had to get it in a month before (induction),” he said during a Zoom media conference Thursday, six days before his scheduled Cooperstown induction.  “I didn’t want anyone to see it before I delivered it. And I haven’t finished it yet.  “I’ve addressed crowds before – especially when we closed the old Yankee Stadium.But this speech will be different.”  Jeter, who came to Cooperstown in 2019 for the induction of long-time Yankees teammate Mariano Rivera, admitted that he has tried not to think about his own.  “I don’t want to jinx things,” said Jeter, who fell one vote shy of duplicating Rivera’s unprecedented unanimous vote. There are too many things happening in the world.  “I’m trying not to think about [my induction]. I look forward to getting there, seeing the museum, and spending time with the Hall of Famers. I don’t want to go in with any pre-conceived notions.”  Jeter, now the CEO of the Miami Marlins, played a record 20 years for the Yankees, his only major-league team, and earned five World Series rings.  “You’re judged by winning,” he said, “especially in New York. That’s what makes Old Timers Day so important. Yogi Berra used to come into the locker room and remind me how many rings he had (10).  “I like to compete. I became vocal about it the last 10 years or so of my career. That’s why I wanted to become part of an ownership group.”  Derek Jeter, now CEO of the Miami Marlins, won't reveal his Hall of Fame speech in advance. (Photo ... [+] by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) Jeter said he is trying to instill the winning tradition he experienced in New York with his young Marlins team.  “What people need to understand is the most important thing is to win,” he said. “Winning is something you have to learn to do. Our ultimate goal is to win and we try to teach everyone here to win.”  There won’t be any question about the logo that appears on Jeter’s bronze Hall of Fame plaque.  “I want to be remembered as a Yankee,” he said in response to a question about his legacy. “When you’re playing, it’s much more than what you do on the field that counts.”  His Derek Jeter Foundation has given back to the local communities in Michigan, where Jeter spent his youth, as well as New York and Miami. The upcoming Yankees-Mets game on September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, has also caught his attention.  “Sports has a great way of bringing communities together,” he said. “When we first got back to playing after 9/11, we were thinking ‘Does this really matter?’  “We felt we were playing for all of New York. Before the first game of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, that was the loudest pre-game roar I ever heard in New York. We didn’t win but we gave New Yorkers something to cheer for.”  Jeter gave them plenty. Handed the title of captain by then-manager Joe Torre, he ran with it.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) “It’s a title not thrown around too lightly in that organization,” said Jeter. “Joe said he didn’t want me to change anything – just to be myself.”  Aware that the Yankees are a global brand, Jeter has visited Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Panama, and other places in Latin America.  “There’s a big Yankee following in all those countries,” he said. Many of those fans have fond memories of Jeter.  “I tried to play the game right and played the game hard,” he said. Doing that makes you feel good.”  Later in his career, as age and injuries took their toll, whispers started about Jeter’s declining defense.  “You slow down at the end of your career, but when a play needed to be made, I felt I was going to make it,” said the long-time shortstop, who never played any other position. “And my teammates had confidence in me too.”  Jeter broke in at age 20 and retired at age 40. But he still thinks young.  “There needs to be more action in the game,” he told the Zoom audience. “Fans want to see things happen. I like the automatic runner on second base in extra innings, for example. Every sport has to change and evolve over time.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2021/09/02/thoughtful-derek-jeter-takes-his-time-preparing-hall-of-fame-speech/,Thoughtful Derek Jeter Takes His Time Preparing Hall Of Fame Speech
"Texas’ near-total abortion ban is likely to start a national trend after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law, as Florida state lawmakers became the first in an expected string of Republican state legislators Thursday to signal they intend to pass their own anti-abortion legislation that copies Texas and lets private citizens, rather than the government, enforce the law. Anti- and pro-abortion rights activists demonstrate in front of the the U.S. Supreme Court on ... [+] January 24, 2020 in Washington, DC. Florida State Senate President Wilton Simpson, a Republican, said in a statement Thursday it would be “worthwhile to take a look at the Texas law and see if there is more we can do here in Florida.” Simpson told local outlet WFLA the legislature was “already working on” legislation that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as Texas’ does, and when asked by the Tampa Bay Times about his “legislative intentions” in light of the Texas law responded only with a smiling sunglesses emoji. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he “welcome[s] pro-life legislation” and described the Texas law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), as “interesting,” noting he planned to “look more significantly” at the law. While most abortion bans have been struck down in court, SB 8 was crafted to withstand legal scrutiny by stipulating only private citizens can enforce the abortion ban through private lawsuits against anyone that “aids and abets” an abortion—and receive at least $10,000 in damages if they’re successful. John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, the anti-abortion group that helped draft the Texas law, told Forbes he is already working with three other states to draft legislation modeled after SB 8—but did not specify which, since their efforts are not yet public—and said he expects “in the next few weeks you’ll see a lot of these [bills] filing.” Seago suggested lawmakers in South Carolina are also moving forward with similar legislation, though so far none have appeared to comment on it publicly, but his group is not directly involved with South Carolina or Florida’s legislation. Despite being narrow and based more on procedural issues than the actual law itself, the Supreme Court’s ruling that upheld SB 8 “seem[s] to indicate that this is a good strategy,” Seago told Forbes about the Texas law’s stipulation that private citizens enforce the ban instead of the government. Seago noted that the law’s “specific enforcement mechanism” putting the onus on private citizens is what appeared to prompt the Supreme Court to give the bill the “green light.” “This is not a ‘What happens in Texas stays in Texas’ situation,” Kristin Ford, NARAL Pro-Choice America’s acting vice president of communications and research, told HuffPost before the Supreme Court’s ruling came out. “There’s also the very real threat that this has a domino effect in other states that are hellbent on ending legal abortion.” In addition to South Carolina, the next states to move forward with Texas-style abortion legislation could be Arizona and Ohio, abortion rights groups that track state policy predicted to Politico, along with other states that have previously passed fetal heartbeat bills like Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and North Dakota. Democratic leaders in the federal government have vowed to fight against state actions to restrict abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement the chamber will take up the Women’s Health Protection Act when it returns from its August recess, which would enshrine the right to an abortion into federal law. President Joe Biden also directed his administration Thursday to undertake a “whole-of-government effort” to combat the Texas law. While it’s not yet clear what specific steps could be taken, the president asked his Gender Policy Council and Office of White House Counsel to develop strategies specifically involving the Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services, and said he’s interested in what “legal tools” can be used against SB 8. Texas’ law comes as GOP state lawmakers have consistently passed legislation aimed at banning abortion in recent years, with the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute reports 90 abortion restrictions had already been enacted nationwide in 2021 alone as of July 1. Similar abortion bans have always been struck down in court under the Supreme Court’s precedent in Roe v. Wade holding abortion is legal, making Texas’ law the most extreme restrictions on abortion in the U.S. to actually go into effect since the 1973 Roe decision. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Wednesday against striking down SB 8 because they believed it was too soon to bring a legal challenge against the defendants that were named in the case, among other procedural issues, rather than issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the law itself. The justices said future legal challenges can still be brought against the Texas law, and Seago told Forbes he predicts the issue of whether the abortion ban is constitutional will play out in court when private citizens bring litigation to enforce the law. Whether Texas’ novel approach to getting around the courts with its abortion ban will even be necessary soon. The Supreme Court will take up a challenge against Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban next term and consider whether abortions can be restricted even before the fetus is viable. That could result in the conservative-leaning court significantly weakening Roe v. Wade or overturning it entirely, potentially paving the way for states to impose abortion bans without more roundabout enforcement mechanisms like in SB 8.

"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo while it continues to investigate why the spacecraft flew off course during its high profile July 11 test flight carrying founder Richard Branson into space, even as the company announces another space mission set for the end of the month. TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, NM - JULY 11: Virgin Galactic's VMS Eve carries the VSS Unity on takeoff from ... [+] Spaceport America, July 11, 2021 in Truth Or Consequences, New Mexico. Aboard VSS unity are pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, and mission specialists Sirisha Bandla, British billionaire and founder of Virgin Galactic Sir Richard Branson, Colin Bennett, and Beth Moses. The VSS Unity is scheduled to travel to an altitude of over 50 miles above the Earth. (Photo by David Lienemann/Getty Images) The FAA told Forbes  flights on Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo will be suspended until the agency approves its final mishap investigation report or determines that the issues related to the incident don’t affect public safety.  The agency said SpaceShipTwo “deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance”—in other words, flew off a carefully prescribed, FAA-approved path— upon returning to Spaceport America during its flight, which is given to ensure that the spacecraft doesn’t collide with any commercial flights. The FAA’s investigation was prompted by a New Yorker article, which uncovered that the flight went off-course during its descent, triggering a red light warning that the spacecraft wasn’t flying as steeply as it was supposed to be, and that the pilot chose to correct the ship rather than abort its descent, which experts told the New Yorker would have been the safest way to respond. In response to the FAA’s investigation, Virgin Galactic acknowledged the flight’s trajectory “deviated” from its initial plan for a short distance and time (1 minute and 41 seconds) due to high altitude winds, but argued that pilots monitored the trajectory to make sure the spacecraft was within “mission parameters.”  The company also said even though the flight shifted from the original plan, it was a “controlled and intentional flight path” that allowed the spacecraft to land safely, and the change in trajectory did not put the crew in danger.  Virgin Galactic announced another SpaceShipTwo Unity test flight mission Thursday carrying crew members from the Italian Air Force and National Research Council, aiming to launch at the end of September or early October. Virgin Galactic did not comment on if the second test flight mission may be affected by the FAA’s decision to bar SpaceShipTwo from operating. “We have been working closely with the FAA to support a thorough review and timely resolution of this issue,” a Virgin Galactic spokesperson told Forbes. “We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions.” Branson made headlines when he made his first trip to space, launching from Spaceport America’s base in New Mexico, along with five other Virgin Galactic employees on July 11. He beat out Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose space company Blue Origin launched its own inaugural space flight just nine days later on July 20. Branson had been working to create technology to launch into space for about 17 years, creating his first spacecraft VSS Enterprise in 2014, which was destroyed during a test flight. The crash ended up killing one pilot and left a second pilot hospitalized. Virgin Galactic’s second spacecraft, which is the one Branson used to get to space in July was created in 2016 and made its first trip to space in 2018 after multiple testing. The July launch was the company’s second test of the spacecraft. If the FAA’s investigation will affect sales for Virgin Galactic’s commercial space flights which are set to launch in 2022. In August, the company said that it would start selling tickets for $450,000 next year, with multi-seat packages and full-plane reservations available.  Richard Branson’s 17-Year Journey Into Space: How The Virgin Founder Became First Billionaire To Fly Own Rocket (Forbes) Virgin Galactic Restarts Spaceflight Ticket Sales For A Stratospheric $450,000 A Pop (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-spacecraft-following-branson-flight-mishap/,FAA Grounds Virgin Galactic Spacecraft Following Branson Flight Mishap
"Florida’s ban on school districts imposing mask mandates is now no longer legally enforceable as a ruling striking down the state policy took effect Thursday—but the Florida Department of Education still intends to move forward with its plans to withhold funding from schools that have mask mandates by immediately appealing the ruling. Students wearing face masks at Baldwin Park Elementary School on August 10 in Orlando, Florida.  Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper ruled Friday the state’s policy restricting school mask mandates was unlawful, and issued a permanent injunction blocking the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) from enforcing the policy—but the ruling only took effect Thursday when Cooper signed his written order. Florida prohibited school districts from imposing mask mandates unless parents could opt their children out of it, which Cooper ruled the state did not have the authority to do and was not in line with Florida's “Parents’ Bill of Rights” law that state officials used as a justification for the policy.  FDOE had moved forward with enforcing the policy even after Cooper’s ruling, as Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced Monday the state had withheld funding from Alachua and Broward counties, the first two school districts that imposed strict mask mandates without a parental opt-out.  The state said it will withhold an amount equivalent to the school board members’ salaries, and will continue withholding the funds each month until the districts’ mask policies are changed. FDOE communications director Jared Ochs told Forbes in an interview Tuesday the department will “keep [withholding funds] until a court tells us we cannot,” as it intends to immediately appeal Cooper’s ruling, which Ochs said will trigger a stay that blocks the ruling while the litigation continues to play out. FDOE also intends to continue moving forward with punishments against school districts that followed Alachua and Broward by imposing their own mask mandates, Ochs said, and the department sent letters warning of impending consequences to at least eight school districts on Friday—though the school districts have so far kept their mask mandates in effect despite the consequences. “A governor’s executive order and an agency’s actions must be based on authority granted to them by the Constitution or the Legislature,” Cooper wrote in his ruling striking down the mask mandate ban. “Executive power exercised without authority is illegal, null and void, and unenforceable.” At least 13. That’s how many Florida school districts have now imposed mask mandates that the state believes violate its policy, including those covering Florida’s largest cities like Miami, Orlando, Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Tampa, Tallahassee and Sarasota. Brevard, Lee and Volusia counties became the latest districts to vote in favor of mask mandates this week in light of Cooper’s ruling, with Lee County also becoming the third Republican-leaning district to issue a strict mandate after Sarasota and Indian River counties. Once the state appeals Cooper’s ruling and an automatic stay is issued, Ochs said, the case will go back to the district court, where Cooper will once again rule on the case on appeal. If Cooper rules against the state again, the department of education then intends to go to the appeals court and ask for another stay from that court in order to keep the mask mandate ban in effect. As this litigation is playing out, the state could also potentially face new legal challenges from the districts that are facing funding cuts over their mask orders, on top of the multiple parent-led lawsuits that have already been filed. Carlee Simon, superintendent of Alachua County Public Schools, told NBC News the district has already started the process to take legal action to “ensure that Florida's districts have the right to act in the best interests of those they serve.” Florida is one of 10 states that have enacted policies that ban or severely restrict school mask mandates—not all of which are in effect—though the state’s policy has proved particularly contentious as Florida faces a massive Covid-19 surge. The state’s Covid outbreak has already affected thousands of students and shut down some schools entirely, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has stood by the state’s mask mandate ban despite the controversy and downplayed the impact of the pandemic in schools. “I think at the end of the day, we’re just trying to stand with the parents,” DeSantis said at a press conference Monday about the mask mandate ban, predicting the state was “going to have really good grounds to appeal” Cooper’s ruling.

"A former Minnesota police officer will face a first-degree manslaughter charge for fatally shooting Daunte Wright in April, state Attorney General Keith Ellison said Thursday, another charge for an officer accused of mistakenly using her gun instead of a Taser during a traffic stop. Demonstrators raise their mobile phones during a protest outside a police station on April 16, 2021 ... [+] in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. Ellison’s office filed an amended complaint Thursday against former police officer Kimberly Potter, adding first-degree manslaughter to the second-degree manslaughter charge initially brought by a local prosecutor in April. First-degree manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and $30,000 in fines, compared to 10 years and $20,000 for second-degree manslaughter. The complaint accused Potter of recklessly handling a firearm so death or bodily harm was “reasonably foreseeable,” part of the standard for first-degree manslaughter, and the second-degree charge alleges Potter acted with “culpable negligence.” In a statement, Ellison’s office said it chose to add first-degree manslaughter following a review of the evidence launched after he took over the case from a local prosecutor. Potter’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “After conducting that review — which included consulting with an expert in police use of force — Attorney General Ellison confirmed that the original second-degree manslaughter charge is appropriate, but also concluded that an upgraded charge of first-degree manslaughter is warranted,” Ellison’s office said. Potter shot Wright — a 20-year-old unarmed Black man — after police pulled him over in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center for driving with an expired registration and tried to take him into custody for an outstanding arrest warrant, according to the complaint. In police body camera footage, Potter is seen yelling “taser, taser, taser” at Wright and then shooting him with a handgun. Wright later died of a gunshot wound. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon later described the incident as an accidental discharge. The shooting occurred while a trial against Derek Chauvin — a Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd — took place just miles away, reigniting outrage about police misconduct. Potter’s trial is scheduled to start in late November.

"MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JULY 20: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Vilde Boe Risa of Manchester United poses after ... [+] signing for the club at Carrington Training Ground on July 20, 2021 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Manchester United/Manchester United) Manchester United may have pulled off the biggest transfer coup of the summer bringing Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club but their women's team believe their acquisition of Norwegian play-maker Vilde Bøe Risa will prove just as decisive when the Barclays FA Women's Super League kicks-off tomorrow. Last summer, Manchester United were the talk of the women's game after signing two of the United States' World Cup winning squad, Christen Press and Tobin Heath on one-year contracts, and after leading the Women's Super League at the end of the first half of the season, supporters were hopeful that more big-name transfers would follow with the team qualifying for this season's UEFA Women's Champions League. However, the team's fortunes tailed off as the season climaxed with the team dropping out of the top three European qualifying positions, Press and Heath returning back home to play their soccer in the United States and manager Casey Stoney also decamping after resigning to take up a coaching position with San Diego in the National Women's Soccer League. With eight players departing, supporters have been disappointed that more signings have not been made with head coach Marc Skinner revealing the club would not be active on ""deadline day"" as the women's transfer window came to a close this afternoon. However, it is the signing made nine days before his appointment which fans are hoping will help them compensate for the loss of five attacking players over the summer.  After scoring against her new club's city rivals, Manchester City, in her final match for Swedish side Kopparbergs/Göteborg FC last December, Bøe Risa made the decision not to re-sign for the club in order to pursue a career abroad. Stymied by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Bøe Risa was forced to train with, and eventually sign for, local side Sandviken in order to maintain her fitness. However when Manchester United came calling, Bøe Risa persuaded Sandviken to terminate her one-year contract in June having only played three games for the club.  Pivotal in the move, was the opportunity to join her Norwegian team-mate, Maria Thorisdottir who signed for Manchester United in January. Bøe Risa said, ""I talked to her a lot, how it is here, how she has settled in. She said a lot of good things. It was a tough half-year for her, coming in the middle of the season. She had a tough time but she still said some good things about the club"".  NICE, FRANCE - JUNE 22: Vilde Boe Risa and Maria Thorisdottir of Norway celebrate after their team ...

(Photo by Hannah Peters - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images) The 26-year-old Bøe Risa eventually signed a two-year contract with Manchester United on July 20 claiming she was ""happy to be here at such a big club that I have grown up supporting. Manchester United is huge in Norway so to be able to come here and play for the team is a dream come true"". Speaking to the media last week, she revealed it was not watching the famous Norwegian internationals who played for the club, like current men's manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who persuaded her to follow the team, but someone much closer to home. ""My brother forced me to cheer for Manchester United"", she admitted. ""That's the main reason. My mum and my boyfriend is cheering for Liverpool and my dad cheered for Chelsea so I just had to cheer for Manchester United so my brother could be one-up"". Despite the popularity of Manchester United in Norway, the young Bøe Risa was not one to follow soccer on television or idolize any of the players. ""I didn't watch much as a little girl. I was mostly playing outside myself. I knew about (Cristiano) Ronaldo and all the big players, Rooney of course, but I don't have one specific person"". As a teenager she split her time between playing soccer and handball, and could have pursued a career in either but eventually made the decision to follow in the footsteps of her late father Terje, who played 96 times for Norwegian side SK Brann before serving on the club's board of directors. ""I had to take the decision when I started at college. I could choose either handball or football. The reason why I chose football was because I could have a better future in it. I had the same coach at my club as in school. I had a lot of friends that I could play with. It just felt right for me to do because of the circumstances around football. When I watch handball now, I miss it, but I know I made the right decision to play football"". After sustaining an anterior cruciate injury in February 2017 which put her out of the game for twelve months and forced her to miss that year's European Championship finals, Bøe Risa recovered to start all five of Norway's matches at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. She describes herself as someone who likes to create from midfield. ""I'm a person that likes to have the ball, a typical play-maker. I'm a bit higher up the pitch so someone who can take a shot, score a goal and hopefully deliver good passes and assists."" TOPSHOT - Norway's midfielder Vilde Boe Risa celebrates her team's first goal during the 2019 ...

(Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo credit should read LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) The skill to find space in small areas developed by playing handball is perhaps what gives Bøe Risa the ability to pick out the passes which have caught the eye of her new coach Skinner. He told me, ""I've seen her pass some balls which I can't even see in training, and I try and pride myself on trying to see every opportunity, as much as I can, to exploit the opponent. ""V"" has almost this ""third eye"" where she can see things potentially others can't."" Having started all four pre-season games alongside her in midfield, club captain Katie Zelem has also been impressed. ""I've really enjoyed playing with Vilde, as do the other midfielders if you were to ask them. She's technically very good on the ball and she understands the game. That's the sort of player anyone would want to play with. It's been great bringing her in. It just gives us a few more more options really, especially with Jackie (Groenen) and (Ella) Toone who were obviously away at the Olympics for a long time. It allows Marc to have a bit more flexibility in rotating players and being able to use the size of our squad"".  Skinner believes Bøe Risa has been quick to adapt to the English style of play and what he wants from her, with and without the ball. ""We'll continue to get ""V"" up to the speed of play, in terms of mentally off-the-ball as well. She, for sure, has so much quality in finding the killer passes but also being simplistic in the build-up, making and selecting the right things to do. She's a very, very talented player, but what I've been most impressed with is her attitude to accepting a different kind of variation of play."" The most high-profile of five summer signings, much will be expected of Bøe Risa starting on Friday when Manchester United play Reading in the opening match of the season, and the first to be broadcast as part of a new lucrative television deal with Sky Sports. Her ambition is clear. ""Of course I want to win titles and I want to help the team. Mainly my focus is to qualify for the Champions League because that's the biggest tournament you can play in"". Skinner expects the Norwegian could be one of the stars of the new season. ""She has the skill-sets that can unlock any defense in this league and hopefully we get to see that throughout this season and we're talking maybe a little bit more towards Christmas about the things that she's done rather than what we think she can do"".",https://www.forbes.com/sites/asifburhan/2021/09/02/vilde-be-risa-hoping-to-propel-manchester-united-women-into-champions-league/,Vilde Bøe Risa Hoping To Propel Manchester United Women Into Champions League
"Milwaukee catcher Ted Simmons awaits a throw as St. Louis runner Ozzie Smith races home during the ... [+] 1982 World Series. (Photo by Focus On Sport/Getty Images) For more than three decades, Ted Simmons was The Man Time Forgot.  A switch-hitting catcher who provided power plus leadership for three different clubs, it took him 31 years to go from an after-thought on the writers’ ballot to a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.  He’ll be inducted Sept. 8 at the Clark Sports Center in Cooperstown, along with Derek Jeter, Larry Walker, and the late union chief Marvin Miller.  Despite a stellar career that included postseason appearances with the St. Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers, Simmons couldn’t muster the 5 per cent required to stay on the ballot, losing his spot after his first year of eligibility in 1994. He had already been retired as a player for five years – and then had to wait 26 more before a veterans committee gave him the minimum 75 per cent of the vote.  Speaking of Miller, also selected by a veterans committee, Simmons said, “It took forever for each of us to get in. He was the real deal.  “During my career, Marvin was the Players Association. He was an incredible man who was very special to me specifically. It’s an honor to be inducted with him.  “It’s bittersweet for his family but I’m lucky I can arrive in the flesh.”  Rejected seven times in previous attempts, Miller will be inducted posthumously. Both Simmons and Miller were members of the Hall of Fame Class of 2020 who had to wait an extra year for their enshrinement because of the pandemic.  “The wait has been good and bad,” Simmons told writers in a pre-induction Zoom call Thursday. “It’s bad that I had to wait for it to come to but good that it was extended a year. It allowed me to stay twice as long in the room.”  The former St. Louis slugger said the advent of analytics helped his Cooperstown candidacy.  Newly-minted Hall of Famer Ted Williams was a switch-hitting slugger for the Brewers, Braves, and ... [+] Cardinals. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)  “Guys on the cusp have always said the Hall of Fame is difficult to get into and it should be,” he said. “What they did (with the veterans committees) was expand the process, broaden the process, and enable people who fell through the cracks like myself. Lucky for me, they changed things.”  He said he received a warm welcome from incumbent members of the Hall of Fame, which now has 333 members.  “The Hall of Fame membership has been really special, pulling for me,” said Simmons, who singled out former Cardinals Ozzie Smith and Lee Smith as among the first to congratulate him.  “I know so many of them. It’s like a fraternity, with people reaching out and extending hands of welcome.”  Writing and delivering his induction speech would be easier than batting in a packed ballpark, he hinted.  “I got right after it,” he revealed. “In a short period of time, I was confident I would get to say what I wanted to say. They told me I had 8-10 minutes so I cut it down to fit that format.  “I didn’t think it was difficult at all – but I’m glad I’m reading it rather than remembering it, especially at my age (73). I don’t want people staring back at me with giant yawns.”  As a young man, Simmons said, he wanted to go to college, satisfy his military commitment, and play baseball. By the time he turned 27, he had done all three – though he finished the last two years of college after retiring as a player.  “I had to juggle three balls in the air,” he laughed. It might have been easier for him to catch Hall of Fame pitchers Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton in St. Louis, Don Sutton in Milwaukee, and Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz in Atlanta.  “They stand out so dramatically,” said Simmons, who had a reputation for durability. “People have no idea how special those guys were. Carlton had a great career but was just a fastball/curveball pitcher in St. Louis. When he went to Philadelphia, he developed a slider that was like an atomic bomb going off.”  Simmons will join Gary Carter, Pudge Rodriguez, and Mike Piazza as recent receivers who have reached the Hall but suggests Yadier Molina and Buster Posey are strong candidates to join them.  Current Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina could follow Ted Simmons to Cooperstown, says the Hall's new ... [+] inductee. (Photo by Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images) “They could be the next catchers to get in,” he said during the 30-minute Zoom call.  He also said he has no hard feelings toward Whitey Herzog, who traded him from St. Louis to Milwaukee. “I respect him and he respects me,” Simmons said. “Whitey is welcome at my house any time he wants to come over.”  Herzog, a Hall of Famer himself, happened to be on the veterans committee that elected Simmons in December 2019. “I don’t know if that helped or not,” he said.  The coronavirus pandemic cancelled the 2020 inductions as well as the vote of the veterans committee scheduled for the baseball winter meetings, which were also wiped out.  “It was such a difficult thing trying to work through,” Simmons said. “It was a difficult time in society in general over the last two years. The fact that [the induction] is now going to happen brings us close to normalcy.  “What all of us want is to see some normal operation of our lives. It’s a stride in the right direction and I’m all for that.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2021/09/02/once-ignored-ted-simmons-finally-finds-his-way-to-cooperstown/,Once-Ignored Ted Simmons Finally Finds His Way To Cooperstown
"Carson Wentz, the Indianapolis Colts starting quarterback and their highest-paid player, addressed his vaccination status for the first time Thursday, confirming he has not received the jab, and the team's top linebacker, Darius Leonard, revealed he is unvaccinated as well. ""It's a process. I'm weighing every pro and con out there,"" Wentz said Thursday. ""It keeps me up at ... [+] night, and a lot of things go on inside my head, but it's where we're at right now."" Wentz told reporters his choice not to get vaccinated was a ""personal decision"" and would not ""go in depth on why"" he made it.  When asked if he considered the risks of not getting the shot, Wentz replied, ""I've weighed a lot of things, I've factored in everything, and I know what's at stake."" Wentz, who signed a four-year, $128 million contract in 2019, stated his evaluation of the vaccination is an ""ongoing process,"" and ""things could change in the next coming weeks.""  Leonard, an All-Pro linebacker whom the Colts inked to a record-setting five-year, $98.5 million contract extension last month, explained that he had yet to receive his shot because he was concerned about potential ""the long-term effects and stuff like that."" Speaking with the media after practice, Leonard said he wants ""to get more educated about"" the vaccine and doesn't ""want to rush into it."" ""It's a process. I'm weighing every pro and con out there,"" Wentz said Thursday. ""It keeps me up at night, and a lot of things go on inside my head, but it's where we're at right now."" Wentz was activated off the Covid-19 reserve list on Thursday after spending five days in quarantine after reportedly coming in close contact with a Colts staff member who tested positive. This is notable because, under the protocols developed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, only unvaccinated players are subject to be quarantined due to contact tracing. Vaccinated players only need to quarantine if they personally test positive. Two other important team members, center Ryan Kelly and wide receiver Zach Pascal, were also forced to quarantine this week, reportedly for the same reason. Guard Quenton Nelson, the team's best offensive lineman, was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list last week due to close contact with someone who tested positive. According to ESPN, the Colts have one of the lowest percentages of vaccinated players in the league. The team's head coach, Frank Reich, and defensive coordinator, Matt Eberflus, tested positive for Covid-19 during training camp. On Wednesday, Colts general manager Chris Ballard stated there are ""consequences"" to not being vaccinated. Ballard explained that he ""absolutely"" believes everybody on the team should get their shot, and the organization has attempted to educate players on the scientifically proven benefits of the vaccine, but added, ""for the guys who have chosen to not get vaccinated, they still understand they're still part of this team."" Under the NFL's new protocols, teams that experience a Covid-19 outbreak among unvaccinated players will be forced to forfeit any game that can't be rescheduled. The ""burden of the cancellation or delay will fall on the club experiencing the Covid infection,"" commissioner Roger Goodell declared in a memo to the league's 32 clubs. Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians announced Thursday each member of the Buccaneers franchise has been vaccinated against Covid-19. ""We're 100% vaccinated — our entire organization — all the players, all the coaches, everybody,"" Arians said. The Bucs are the second NFL team to reach the 100% threshold, joining the Atlanta Falcons. 93%. That's the percentage of NFL players that have been vaccinated as of last Friday, according to NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills.

Cawthorn’s characterization of the riot as largely peaceful is in line with comments from Republicans like Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) who have routinely downplayed the attack, but at odds with videos and testimony revealing a large-scale assault on police by a massive mob in order to breach the building. Cawthorn also declined to respond to a question about Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed as she attempted to breach the House chamber in an incident caught on video, telling the outlet, “I don't actually know much of what happened in that instance.” 1,000. That’s how many assaults were committed by Capitol rioters on federal officers, prosecutors wrote in a court filing on Wednesday. More than 100 of the 631 Capitol riot defendants have been charged with assaulting or impeding officers. “We have no plans, and no one is trying to start any form of a protest or anything in Washington. When I said I was actively working on it, I meant I was actually working on getting answers about the political prisoners following Jan. 6,” Cawthorn said of telling a man who asked when Cawthorn is “calling us back up to Washington” that he is “actively working on that one.” Cawthorn’s comments were roundly criticized by his Democratic colleagues, as well as two anti-Trump Republicans serving on a committee likely targeting Cawthorn for his efforts to overturn the election. “This is insane,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said, with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) calling for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to condemn the remarks.

"President Biden wants the U.S. economy to make a big bet on solar energy, and Congress appears poised to help him deliver on that desire: The Senate-passed infrastructure bill contains $73 billion of new subsidies for renewable energy and the budget reconciliation bill contains a provision that would increase and extend the solar investment tax credit for homeowners and businesses to purchase solar panels. However, Biden’s trade policy may complicate his government’s attempt to increase production of renewable energy in the United States.  The conflict lies in Biden’s choice to continue President Trump’s more confrontational approach towards China, especially when it comes to the treatment of the Uighur minorities, who are being heavily persecuted across the country.  Most solar panels installed in the United States are made in Southeast Asia, although some domestic assembly of solar panels does occur domestically. However, nearly all solar wafers come from China. If the Biden administration wants their green energy goals met, they must be prepared to work with China until we can bolster the upstream supply chain outside of China.  A few months ago, an unpublished study was leaked to the media alleging that nearly all of the solar materials coming into the United States are linked to suppliers operating in Xinjiang Province, where there are Uighur detention camps, and that they used forced labor.  U.S. law rightly prohibits the importation of goods produced by forced labor. On June 24, 2021, U.S. Border and Customs Patrol (CBP) issued a Withhold Release Order (WRO) against silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry (Hoshine) because it had been alleged that they used forced labor at their factories in Xinjiang.  This is problematic for two reasons; first, the evidence that connects slave labor to the production of polysilicon products is less than concrete and is based on a leaked, yet-to-be-published report put out by a firm that has connections to an entity that stands to benefit from a reduction in imports of solar panels. And because of the nature of how CBP operates, the burden of proof is on the accused to prove their innocence. Second, due to China’s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, documenting and tracing the U.S. solar supply chain is nearly impossible, especially with a raw material that is buried so deep within the chain. Due to the guilty until proven innocent nature of CPB’s directive, there is no telling when these holdings and detainments will cease because of the difficulties in establishing that  solar modules coming into the U.S. don’t contain any of the forbidden Hoshine material.  If this effort gets taken to its logical conclusion, then most solar panels produced anywhere in Asia will be refused entry into the United States, which would  leave our country without access to a reliable supply of solar panels for the immediate future.  Few would dispute the need to confront China on its perfidious treatment of its Uighur minority, not to mention various other human rights abuses in the country. But our government cannot simultaneously take steps to dramatically increase the demand for solar panels while also dramatically limiting supply, and the fact that it’s doing so based on nonpublic data provided by an entity with skin in the game is highly problematic. It ensures riches for those solar panel producers that escape the maws of the export ban but for everyone else—solar panel installers, utilities, and people trying to reduce their energy consumption and help reduce carbon emissions—it represents an unmitigated disaster, and unless it’s resolved it may render any energy plan coming from this Administration effectively moot.  A better response would be for the government to recognize the problem, conduct its own research, and if its own findings establish a link, it should provide the companies that import solar panels a modicum of time to cease their relationship with any entity using Uighur unpaid labor or take steps to relocate their production outside of China altogether.  Several solar companies with productions formerly in China have done just that, and others appear ready to follow. However, both of these take some time to do. Giving these companies that time to do one or the other would allow the U.S. to still put pressure on the Chinese to end its heinous treatment of the Uighurs while also avoiding a sharp disruption to efforts to increase solar energy in the U.S.  President Biden is correct in choosing to confront China on its human rights abuses, and trade policy is about the most effective lever we have with which to do so. However, it needs to be done judiciously so that we avoid unduly harming U.S. businesses as well, not to mention efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.   It is neither possible nor desirable to completely end our economic dealings with China, but we can engage with its businesses and still maintain our country’s integrity. We need to take time to balance these with regard to our importation of solar panels.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ikebrannon/2021/09/02/confronting-chinese-human-rights-issues-complicates-the-biden-administrations-green-agenda/,Confronting Chinese Human Rights Issues Complicates The Biden Administration’s Green Agenda
"Novak Djokovic has signed an extension to remain with Lacoste until 2025. (Photo by Sarah ...

He just signed an extension to remain with the brand for on-court apparel sponsorship until 2025, keeping Djokovic the face of the crocodile in the sport that gave the brand its start in 1933. As part of the extension, Lacoste plans to include annual Lacoste x Novak Djokovic collections, each developed around the style and performance needs of the Serbian star for on the court and off, around the Grand Slam tournaments every year.  ""Novak is not only an exceptional athlete, but also one of those great champions who have a wonderful spirit both on and off the court,"" says Thierry Guibert, Lacoste CEO. ""Our meeting in 2017 was a real coup de Coeur. His audacity, tenacity and kindness impressed me, and I am proud that we can continue or common adventure together and accompany him in his new challenges.""  Lacoste plans to continue special apparel collections Novak Djokovic will feature in Grand Slam ... [+] tournaments. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) The plan for the continued collection drops spans on-court performance pieces and off-court fashion-focused designs. ""I have a real connection with Thierry Guibert,"" Djokovic says. ""We talk regularly, and I've felt his support at each key moment of my career. He even connects with my fan club on social media. It's quite incredible to see all these different people around the world get together to give me their support.""  Djokovic, currently playing in the U.S. Open and in search of the calendar year Grand Slam and what would be a record-breaking 21 individual Grand Slam titles in men's tennis with a victory, is playing in the Lacoste x Novak Djokovic Tournament Collection. The technical product has put a focus on ultra-dry, breathable stretch, Lacoste says, meant to enhance movement. The limited collection includes a stretch regular fit polo, a Crocodile T-shirt and a lightweight zip jacket as the signature elements.  While not the only tennis player on the roster for a brand that was started by tennis legend Rene Lacoste, Djokovic certainly serves as the brand's most recognizable personality. The 34-year-old is one of the world's top-50 highest-earning athletes, according to Forbes, and his prize money winnings from tennis mark the most ever for a player in the sport. Djokovic is also a co-founder of the Professional Tennis Players Association, a group looking to fight for player rights in both men's and women's professional tennis.  The collaboration between Lacoste and Djokovic will continue to expand beyond apparel. In 2020, Lacoste opened the Etendart tennis court in Clichy, France, a court fashioned with geometric designs and with an image of Djokovic. Regularly welcoming school groups and youth associations, the success of the project in France has led Lacoste to plan an extension of the initiative, hoping to encourage diversity of tennis via additional international locations in the coming months.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2021/09/02/lacoste-partnership-with-novak-djokovic-extends-to-2025-includes-annual-us-open-collection/,"Lacoste Partnership With Novak Djokovic Extends To 2025, Includes Annual U.S. Open Collection"
"Online forums peddling ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment have been overwhelmed by memes, explicit content and posts supporting trans rights, effectively grinding some communities to a standstill as increasing numbers of users turn vigilante to rein in rampant coronavirus misinformation online.  Cartoons of horses have been used heavily on some Reddit forums.  r/ivermectin, a Reddit community dedicated to the antiparasitic’s unproven and likely bogus promise as a treatment and preventative for Covid-19, has been overrun with memes, posts supporting trans rights and, with high frequency, explicit cartoons and stories of humans and livestock, typically horses.  The high number of posts and comments on the subreddit— which skyrocketed from around 40 posts and 300 comments a day to around 1,000 and 10,000 respectively during the last week of August—effectively paralyzed the group and the horse problem became so bad the entire group was reclassified by Reddit as NSFW (not safe for work).  New groups set up to discuss the antiparasitic away from the memes and horses have been swiftly flagged in the original group, though appear to have much tighter restrictions on who may post or comment.  The situation on Reddit is extreme but signals an increasing number of users taking steps to tackle misinformation on platforms like TikTok, Twitter and Facebook. Advocates or users of the drug are often targeted with memes on Twitter, for example, including podcast host Joe Rogan, who said he was using ivermectin to treat his Covid-19 infection Wednesday, and Dr. Pierre Kory, one of the drug’s most prominent supporters.      Facebook groups that are open to the public can also be inundated with jokes and memes, typically of a fecal nature after viral reports of people soiling themselves in public after taking ivermectin.    Ivermectin has been used to treat parasitic infections in people and livestock for decades. It’s an important, lifesaving medicine—it earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize—that’s safe when used appropriately. Early studies suggested it could be a promising treatment for Covid-19 but these have not borne out. Multiple, rigorous studies undertaken since have repeatedly found the drug to be of no benefit in treating people with Covid-19 and one of the most promising papers supporting the drug’s use was withdrawn over concerns of data manipulation. Neither its manufacturer nor leading medicines regulators endorse its use for Covid-19. Still, ivermectin has quickly acquired a reputation as a “miracle cure.” It has been embraced around the world throughout the pandemic, particularly in Latin America, South Africa, the Philippines and India and by many, typically vaccine-resistant, groups in the U.S. Ivermectin is most commonly used in the U.S. by veterinarians, and growing numbers of people are reportedly turning to more readily available medicine intended for livestock in a bid to get the drug without a prescription. Prescriptions for the drug are also soaring. An edible paste version of the drug meant for deworming horses, often apple flavored, has proven particularly popular and is the source for many of the horse-related memes. Even if they contain the same active ingredient, there are risks to taking medicines not designed for human use: medications intended for animals are not subject to the same safety standards (such as purity) as those intended for humans, are of different, often more potent, doses and can contain additives that are harmful. Calls to poison control from people taking ivermectin meant for livestock have spiked in recent weeks.  Following a spate of reports of people being hospitalized after taking ivermectin meant for horses, the Food and Drug Administration issued an unusual statement to remind members of the public that “you are not a horse. You are not a cow,” urging them to stop self-medicating with a product meant for livestock.   Tech platforms have had major problems with medical misinformation throughout the pandemic. Amazon autocomplete responses, which are driven by user behavior, reportedly highlighted ivermectin in its suggested results after the first two letters were typed in the search bar, something the company told The Verge it would block. Amazon has also added a warning label to relevant searches linking to the FDA’s ivermectin warning. Facebook’s coronavirus policies have reportedly not stopped groups or even ads pushing false cures from thriving on the site. Facebook told Motherboard it removes “content that attempts to buy, sell, donate or ask for ivermectin,” does not “allow ads promoting ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19” and takes action against any group violating its Covid-19 or vaccine policies, which prohibit making false claims about how to cure or prevent the disease. After its lax policies prompted large-scale revolt among users, Reddit banned r/NoNewNormal Wednesday, an anti-mask and anti-vaccine community on the platform.

"For the first time in four years, the Energy Department has authorized the release of some of its strategic oil supply, after President Joe Biden said Thursday the federal government will use all the tools it has available to combat a significant fuel shortage in Louisiana following Hurricane Ida. President Joe Biden speaks about the response to Hurricane Ida during an event in the South Court ... [+] Auditorium on the White House campus on Thursday in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The Energy Department said it is releasing 1.5 million barrels of crude oil to ExxonMobil Baton Rouge as part of an exchange, meaning the company will be responsible for replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Many oil refineries in Louisiana have had to shut down production due to power outages and damage from Hurricane Ida, and the few that are online are dealing with a significantly lower than usual supply of oil from the Gulf of Mexico. According to the Energy Department, 80% of oil production in the Gulf has come to a halt, along with 83% of natural gas production. The lack of refineries being online along with widespread residential power outages has led to a critical shortage of gasoline in Louisiana, which many people are relying on to power generators. More than 65% of gas stations in both New Orleans and Baton Rouge were out of fuel on Thursday, according to GasBuddy. The Energy Department said tapping into the Reserve is meant ""to alleviate any logistical issues of moving crude oil within areas affected by Hurricane Ida to ensure the region has access to fuel as quickly as possible as they continue their recovery."" The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the largest emergency supply of oil in the world, with 621.3 million barrels of oil as of August 20, which is stored in two Texas facilities and two Louisiana facilities, all of which are underground. The Reserve was created in response to the 1973 OPEC oil embargo against nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War, leading to a shortage in the U.S. that caused the price of oil to skyrocket. The primary purpose of the Reserve is to sell oil onto the market during times of economic hardship, but oil sales have only been authorized three times—in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina and in 2011 due to disruptions in production caused by civil war in Libya. Thursday's agreement—essentially a loan to a private company—is much more common, but usually reserved for major natural disasters. This is the ninth exchange authorized since 2002, and the seventh involving a hurricane. The last exchange was in response to Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The fuel shortage appears mostly localized, with no major impacts on the oil supply to the U.S. as a whole. It's a much different story than what happened after Hurricane Katrina, when gas prices spiked by 45 cents a gallon. More than 900,000. That's how many customers remain without power in Louisiana, according to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, including over 87% of the city of New Orleans.

"Vaccination significantly decreases the risk a child will be hospitalized with Covid-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director (CDC) Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned Thursday following a record-breaking month for kid hospitalizations.

The CDC director also said research shows that the rate of hospitalization was nearly four times higher in the states with the lowest vaccination rates compared to those with the highest vaccine coverage during the month of August.  This highlights the importance of getting vaccines to children over 12 years old who are eligible and encouraging mask usage for those who aren’t, she explained. Walensky, speaking at  at a White House Covid-19 briefing, said there are two full studies breaking down these trends that are set to be released Friday morning. “What is clear from these data is that community-level vaccination coverage protects our children,” Walensky said. “As the number of Covid-19 cases increase in the community, the number of children getting sick, presenting to the emergency room and being admitted to the hospital will also increase.”  The data presented by Walensky follows a record-breaking month for coronavirus-linked child hospitalizations in the U.S. The average number of children admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19 was 330 between August 20 and August 26, a new record, according to the CDC. This follows multiple other records set during the month. The surge is being driven by an exponential increase in the number of cases reported among children, Walensky said Thursday, emphasizing that research so far shows “there is not increased disease severity in children” associated with the hyper infectious delta variant.

"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Thursday drew a clear line in the sand in opposition to Democrats’ proposed $3.5 trillion spending package, setting up a showdown with progressives who have vowed to torpedo a bipartisan infrastructure bill unless it’s paired with “robust” social spending. UNITED STATES - AUGUST 04: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., arrives for the Senate Appropriations ... [+] Committee markup of the FY 22 Energy and Water, Agriculture, and MilCon VA Appropriations Bills, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, August 04, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Manchin, a moderate who tends to be a deciding vote in the 50-50 Senate, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed “if I can’t explain it, I can’t vote for it,” adding that he “can’t explain” why Senate Democrats are “rushing to spend $3.5 trillion.” Manchin accused his fellow Democrats of “reverse-engineering” the package to include long-time liberal policy priorities like Medicare expansion and universal pre-K, arguing such maneuvering “isn’t how you make good policy.” Manchin isn’t alone in balking at the proposed price tag: a spokesperson for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), another moderate, told Politico late last month she “will not support” $3.5 trillion in spending. Both senators’ votes will be needed for Democrats to pass the package, which can circumvent the 60 vote threshold to break a filibuster but still requires support from every Democrat in the chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives in the House, meanwhile, are threatening to vote against a bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill focused on “core” elements like roads and bridges, strongly supported by Manchin and Sinema, if it’s not paired with a “robust” social spending bill. Manchin and Sinema were both members of a bipartisan group of senators that spent months negotiating with the White House to craft the infrastructure bill– talks that came about after discussions between the White House and the Senate GOP collapsed. At the same time, Democrats have pledged to pursue a “two-track” approach wherein the infrastructure bill and the budget bill are paired together, with President Joe Biden pledging not to sign one without the other. “I, for one, won’t support a $3.5 trillion bill, or anywhere near that level of additional spending, without greater clarity about why Congress chooses to ignore the serious effects inflation and debt have on existing government programs,” Manchin wrote, arguing the record levels economic growth touted by the administration means Democrats’ desire to spend trillions more on social programs “ignores present economic reality.” 96. That’s how many House members are in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which said last month an internal survey found at least half its members are willing to hold the infrastructure bill hostage. Still, the bill got support from 19 Republicans in the Senate, meaning it will likely get at least some support from House Republicans as well. “I believe there would have to be dozens and dozens and dozens of Republicans to vote for this. And, I mean, Republicans… can’t even get a critical mass of people to say the election was legitimate,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told Forbes last month when asked if GOP support could offset lost progressive votes to pass the infrastructure bill, adding, “We’ll see.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi struck a deal with a group of moderates last month to hold a vote on the infrastructure bill no later than September 27.

"Jacob Chansley — the horned helmet-wearing “QAnon Shaman” who stood out during the U.S. Capitol riot in January — has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors, his lawyer said Thursday, one of the best-known Capitol breach defendants to strike a deal. Jacob Chansley speaks to passersby during a rally on January 6 in Washington, DC. Chansley will appear in federal court Friday morning for a plea agreement hearing, months after federal authorities arrested Chansley and charged him with violent entry and disorderly conduct, civil disorder and several other offenses. Chansley’s attorney Albert Watkins confirmed to Forbes he’s reached a deal with prosecutors, but he did not offer any details on the arrangement. Watkins told Reuters in July he was attempting to negotiate a plea deal, citing a non-public psychological evaluation that found Chansley is grappling with transient schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Forbes has reached out to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. for comment. Donning a helmet and face paint, Chansley paced around the Capitol building shirtless on Jan. 6 alongside hundreds of Trump supporters, an event that sent lawmakers into hiding and delayed the certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral win. Chansley has drawn frequent attention since his early January arrest in Arizona: He refused to eat for more than a week because a D.C.-area jail didn’t offer organic food, which he said was mandated by his shamanistic religious beliefs, prompting a judge to transfer him to a new jail in February. A judge also ordered a psychological evaluation for Chansley in May, shortly after Watkins told Talking Points Memo many of the Jan. 6 defendants have “brain damage,” are “on the goddamn spectrum” and were brainwashed by pro-Trump propaganda. Chansley expressed regret for entering the Capitol building in a March interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, and Watkins — who says Chansley has “repudiated” the QAnon Shaman nickname — argues his client is nonviolent and thought he was obeying former President Donald Trump’s wishes when he entered the Capitol. “The road leading up to the events of January 6 traversed years,” Watkins said in a statement Thursday. “The path charted by Mr. Chansley since January 6 has been a process, one which has involved pain, depression, solitary confinement, introspection, recognition of mental health vulnerabilities, and a coming to grips with the need for more self-work.” More plea deals. Federal prosecutors have charged nearly 600 people in connection with the Capitol riots, and 50 defendants have pleaded guilty, CNN reported Wednesday.

"How might a carbon tax affect the consumer? Has the ESG finance industry overestimated its influence on oil and gas firms? Will renewables become cheap enough? and can we find better policy alternatives? TOPSHOT - Electric energy generating wind turbines are seen on a wind farm in the San Gorgonio Pass ... [+] area on Earth Day, April 22, 2016, near Palm Springs, California. - San Gorgonio Pass is one of the largest wind farm areas in the United States. (Photo by David McNew / AFP) (Photo credit should read DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images) Earlier in August, my co-conspirator, Bob Eccles, and I posted a “what-if” analysis on Forbes related to what would happen to Exxon’s financials if the U.S. government were to impose a $100 per ton tax on its carbon emissions. We received great feedback on questions that might inform tax and policy debates and investor discussions on energy transition. Part 1 of the feedback series covered the following six questions: (1) Can and (2) will Exxon transform itself? (3) who owns Exxon’s emissions from state owned oil fields? (4) is a carbon tax politically feasible? (5) how should a carbon tax be optimally designed? (6) geopolitical implications of a carbon tax on the oil market.  Part 2, now, covers the following four remaining topics: (7) how might a carbon tax affect the consumer; (8) has the ESG finance industry overestimated its influence on oil and gas firms? (9) will renewables become cheap enough? and (10) can we find better policy alternatives? We will undertake detailed analyses of many of these questions in the months to come.   Feedback, as always, on this story is welcome.   7.0 Impact on the consumer 7.1 Carbon taxes are inflationary “If global oil & gas prices increase materially, that could help support Exxon’s financial strength in the short term but may eventually lead to a global economic slowdown or downturn, which would ultimately hurt everyone.” “I think that sustainability efforts are inflationary, whether it’s carbon taxes, higher wages/living wage, or more sustainable sourcing. Low-income consumers are disproportionately affected by inflation, which means that government needs to subsidize some of this increase to protect purchasing power of lower-income consumers. Presumably, it could come from higher taxation, personal or corporate, and CO2 tax revenues. However, I find it difficult to believe that governments will not expect high emitters to pitch in, in some way/shape/form. Therefore, I think it’s reasonable to expect less than 100% pass-through, net of that contribution.”    7.2 Don’t tax scope 3 emissions. Fix the consumer’s addiction to oil instead  “Oil & gas producers aren’t peddling tobacco or drugs – they exist because the fossil fuels they produce are in demand worldwide. It is somewhat unfair to tax the producers for the Scope 3 emissions generated by their customers when the producers are selling what remains an essential resource worldwide. Not only an essential energy resource, but also a key resource for numerous other products like detergents, asphalt, polyester clothing, rubber tires etc.” 7.3 Do the less well-off need to be subsidized? “I am not a political analyst – but I did notice how the French establishment got a serious jolt from the Gilet Jaune protests when that put extra tax on gas. Much of the outcry seemed to come from the less-well-off in the towns and provinces.” “The European solution has been to use financial stability considerations to drive finance away from these risky industries. I suspect that less visible carbon taxes might also work, e.g. taxing the carbon on imported toys from China. And higher utility bills seem to be acceptable for the build out of green power infrastructure…But the authorities here will probably wait a while prior to taxing gas at the pump…   “The more general point, that the less well-off may suffer the most, will probably need to be addressed via some sort of more progressive approach – maybe involving redistributions, subsidies or maybe something broader a la ‘New Deal’ “  “I think complete outright bans would be something of a last resort – but on the other hand, since the 1950s you can’t burn coal or wood in London and this has eliminated the traditional, unhealthy, London fog (it was a smog really) and, of course, there are congestion charges for entering London which are much lower for electric cars … Finally, the UK Govt has decided that new diesel and petrol cars can’t be sold in the UK after 2030.”  7.4 Can the Government afford loss of revenue and such subsidies? “Except in Europe the consumer of petrol diesel is already through sales taxes and duty paying equivalent to 250-350 dollars a tonne. And in the U.K. alone the government annual tax receipts are ~£35 billion. Can governments afford this loss of revenue and the double whammy of needed subsidies? It will be interesting to see how that is handled .. either way the consumer will pay for the loss of tax revenues and the increase in subsidy.” 7.5 Of course, these taxes will be passed on to the customer! “Here is a paper studying pass-through of EU ETS relatively modest carbon taxes imposed six years ago. The goal of the study was to inform regulators which sectors struggle with pass-through and should, therefore, receive free allowance to avoid carbon leakage (moving of production to less restrictive jurisdictions). The paper discusses factors that determine pass-through ability, including utilization rates, market power, and ability to substitute domestic production with trade. The pass-through rates suggested by the paper are pretty high”  “But just to put it in context fuel duties and vat on petrol and diesel sales in Europe/UK are equivalent to 250-350 dollars per ton already. However you look at carbon tax the consumers pay ..time for politicians and those proposing carbon taxes to be honest ..only through political honesty will changes happen.” “In California, we watched regulators in action. The middle-class customers subsidized the elite purchases of solar panels and Tesla’s!!” 7.6 Consumers will demand cleaner power “People demand this. Even if costs were passed on to consumers more and more will reject these practices and exercise their purchasing power in choosing clean products, including renewable energy generated cheaper than subsidized fossil fuels especially co-located solar and wind.” 7.7 Higher prices will lead to conservation and innovation “The scope 3 tax will indeed be passed on to consumers: this rise in prices will hurt the working poor in the US in the short term if it wasn’t phased in, however, a consistent path to higher consumer prices has always encouraged conservation in the past. Remember the 1970’s - I was a mere boy but I remember going to the gas station with my dad once a week to get our ration. Even adding $1.20/gal to gas prices is probably still below the inflation adjusted cost per fill per car back then given that mileage was closer to 8miles/gal then instead of about 22miles/gal on average now.” “the oil refineries already pass along almost all of the cost of renewable fuel credits to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard today. Officially they claim they absorb it, but that is because the higher the credit goes, the less competitive their petroleum product becomes, and the higher the ratio of biofuels like ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel in the product sold to consumers. Hence, they would rather try to eliminate this program first, but increasingly they realize they are stalling for time and steadily and surely they are building their own biofuels production plants.” 8.0 Has ESG finance over-estimated its influence on oil and gas firms? “The financial sector is over inflating its ability to lead climate action, largely for self-serving claims to sell products; some of the new climate ETFs (exchange traded funds) are complete shams with a fig leaf of engagement to give them credibility. What is really needed is for governments to put policies that have real incentives and disincentives to go with their unaccountable rhetoric about 2050. That is the only thing that will shift behaviour.” 9.0 Will renewables ever become cheap enough? 9.1 No, they won’t “Renewable energy sources will never supply all demand for at least the next 50 years. At some point the costs of solar and wind and other technologies will be so prohibitive to maintain that people will be complaining for cheaper energy. This is because too many want their cake and eat it, too. All you have to look at for an example is the utility crisis in Texas earlier this year. People want everything now and they want it cheap. They run into a problem and the system blows up in their faces and all of a sudden people are screaming bloody murder.” 9.2 Others are more optimistic “With electricity at 2 cents per kw and a $40-$60 per ton carbon tax without exemptions it is cost effective to produce #GreenAmmonia with zero carbon emitted, same thing with hydrocarbon based zero carbon ammonia that otherwise emits 2 tons of CO2 for every ton of NH3 costing $8 per ton in 2021 under Justin Trudeau 90% Industry exemption plan” 10. Quest for better policy alternatives 10.1 Does Canada provide a way forward? “The Canada plan can serve as a possible roadmap for the USA. Canada is asking for 51 pct reduction in emissions from buildings, 58 pct reduction in oil and gas, 55 pct for electricity and 60 pct for heavy industry. 52 pct for waste and other whereas both transport and agriculture get a free ride with only 7 pct and 2.6 pct reduction. It is the consumer driving these changes by selecting products which achieve the goal. I think time frame is ambitious but goals are consistently with Paris accord.” “Direct taxation of scope 1-2 to tackle the company's carbon intensity, and some sort of sliding-scale scope 3 taxation that discourages both the supply and the demand of highly carbon intense products, both domestically produced and imported, and incentivizes change on that front.” 10.2 U.S. government needs to invest in infrastructure “A key difference in 2021 is that there is a growing substitute fuels market which are either low carbon (like renewable gasoline and renewable diesel made from biomass and CNG made from biogas) but also BEV (battery electric vehicle) and FCEV’s (fuel cell electric vehicle) - hydrogen production costs are already coming close to competing with Diesel in California with only LCFS (California’s low carbon fuel standards) credits as support (currently renewable wind, hydro and solar power and hydrogen made from it are not part of the US Renewable Fuel Standard that only applies to Biofuels). More infrastructure in fueling sites is needed across the country but it the lack of federal support that slows this down.”  Last word? “If the intention is to bankrupt large oil companies, the path is clear: tax the evil-doers to extinction. If the intention is to reduce CO2 emissions then demand has to be cut, and that means consumers must bear the costs of taxation. One way or another, greening the energy system will cost consumers or taxpayers which means all of us.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2021/09/02/the-road-to-energy-transition-is-paved-with-good-intentionspart-2/,The Road To Energy Transition Is Paved With Good Intentions—Part 2
"Elon Musk at a SpaceX event in Boca Chica, Texas Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk “likes the social policies” in the state amid a furor over its adoption of a strict new abortion law, following its tighter laws on voting and a loosening of gun rules. The state, which in recent years has convinced companies such as Toyota to move U.S. operations from suburban Los Angeles and lured Apple to invest in a massive new campus in Austin, won’t see a decline in businesses moving to Texas, Abbott told CNBC today. He predicted the state’s policies on social issues, rather than scaring away companies, will become a draw, pointing to Musk, who moved to Austin in 2020. Currently, Tesla is building a new plant near Austin and SpaceX is expanding launch and production operations at its “Starbase” in Boca Chica, in south Texas.  “Elon had to get out of California because in part of the social policies in California,” Abbott said in the interview, noting that he speaks with Musk frequently. “Elon consistently tells me that he liked the social policies in the state of Texas.”  Musk, without directly commenting on Abbott’s remarks, said on Twitter that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”  Texas has been a powerful draw for corporations seeking lower taxes and lighter regulation, particularly relative to states such as California for many years. It remains to be seen whether controversial policies Abbott and Texas legislators have promoted dim the state’s appeal for companies. The state’s ability to attract some skilled workers may be a bit diminished owing to its abortion rule, however. A poll by PerryUndem found that 66% of college-educated workers surveyed said they would not take a job in a state with the restrictions imposed by Texas. Along with restricting abortion, voter access and allowing anyone 21 or older to carry a handgun without training or a license, Abbott has also worked to block public schools from requiring masks to stem the spread of Covid-19 and supported limits on what public school teachers can discuss with regard to current events and systemic racism.  Though Musk has moved from Los Angeles, Tesla’s biggest auto plant is in Fremont, California, and SpaceX headquarters, for now at least, remain in Hawthorne, California.  During the early days of the pandemic last year, Musk grew infuriated when local health officials set restrictions on operations at the Fremont plant, leading him to rant in an earnings call about local stay-at-home efforts that he called “fascist.” Tesla later filed a suit against Alameda County over the restrictions in early May 2020, but soon dropped it.  Though says he prefers to stay out of politics, that’s not always the case. Notably, he joined a business council created by Donald Trump in the early days of his presidency in 2017 (he quit the group in June 2017 after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord). More recently, he was joined at a tour of Tesla’s Giga Berlin plant in August by Armin Laschet, the leading conservative candidate seeking to succeed Angela Merkel as Germany’s next chancellor. Construction of the Tesla plant there appears to be complete, yet the start of production of electric vehicles there remains unclear owing to delays in securing regulatory approvals to do so. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/09/02/elon-musk-likes-the-social-policies-in-texas-according-to-governor-amid-abortion-furor/,"Elon Musk ‘Likes The Social Policies’ In Texas, According To Governor, Amid Abortion Furor"
"More than a dozen of the House’s most right-wing members on Thursday signed onto a letter pushing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for a vote to oust Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) from the House Republican conference over their membership on a committee probing the Capitol riot with a wide investigatory net likely to ensnare some of them.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) (R) listen during a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol July 29, 2021 in Washington, DC. The Republican legislators discussed their visit to a DC correction facility where January 6th Capitol riot suspects are being held. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Among the 16 new signers, all members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, are Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). At least three of the members spoke at D.C. rallies preceding the attack, and others collaborated on efforts to overturn former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, which puts them in the crosshairs of the Jan. 6 panel’s sweeping records requests. The letter, from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), argues Cheney and Kinzinger would act as “spies for the Democrats” in conference meetings where Republicans discuss strategies to counter the panel, pressing McCarthy to allow a conference vote. That only 16 members of the more than 40-strong caucus signed the letter suggests there is division even among the House’s rightmost members about taking such a radical step. The members are proposing a change to conference rules that would expel any member who takes a committee assignment without the blessing of GOP leadership. McCarthy has not ruled out punishing the two lawmakers but said the decision is ultimately up to the conference – though he tabled Biggs’ proposed measure when it was first raised in July, according to ABC News. Cheney and Kinzinger have shown no sign of backing down. Cheney accepted an appointment as vice chair of the committee on Thursday and said she the panel will not be “deterred by threats or attempted obstruction.” Kinzinger spokesperson Maura Gillespie told Forbes repeated calls by some members to oust the two lawmakers “calls into question their true motives.” Cheney and Kinzger, both vocal opponents of their party’s pro-Trump elements, are the only two Republican members of the committee, both appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. McCarthy withdrew his five picks for the panel in July after Pelosi refused to seat two: Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). “The Biden regime’s strategy of arming and equipping those who seek to do us harm is pathetic, and the GOP conference should not fallow [sic] suit. Kinzinger and Cheney should be removed from our conference immediately,” Boebert said in a statement.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-want-cheney-and-kinzinger-booted-from-house-gop/,"Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz Want Cheney And Kinzinger Booted From House GOP"

 , he notes “There was hope that August could become an inflection point – however, we continued to see further plant shutdowns due to a lack of silicon, and now the prospects for new sales for the rest of the year continue to dim with the reality that tight inventory will last well into 2022.”  Research by Cox Automotive painted a similar picture concluding “At this point, indications are new-vehicle inventory issues will continue to stress dealers and consumers through the remainder of the year. The global auto supply chain has always been a fragile operation, and this year has demonstrated just how fragile indeed.” Whatever vehicles are available are going fast. According to CarGurus research, last month on average, vehicles were sold after just over 60 days on the lot, that's down from just under 100 days during August, 2020.  Low supply means higher prices and CarGurus reports the average new car price last month was listed as $44,288, up 2.5% from July. Shoppers can't look for solace at used vehicle lots. As new car sales stall, so do trade-ins, putting pressure on inventories and raising prices. According to CarGurus the average used car in August was listed at $29,129, up 1% from July.  “As we start September, the outlook for the rest of 2021 has chilled slightly,” wrote Roberts. “The potential for a historic sales volume year built on strong consumer demand will not materialize due to inventory, yet it will still be a profitable year for OEMs and dealers as rising prices have offset lost sales.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/09/02/chip-shortage-closes-gm-plants-adds-to-tight-inventories/,"Chip Shortage Closes GM Plants, Adds To Tight Inventories"
" Drastically reducing the number of people incarcerated during the coronavirus pandemic by as much as 80% could have prevented millions of infections and shaved off tens of thousands of virus-linked deaths—a measure nearly as effective in reducing the spread of Covid-19 as mask mandates—according to a study published Thursday in the American Medical Association’s JAMA Network journal.  Inmates sew protective masks at Las Colinas Women's Detention Facility in Santee, California, on ... [+] April 22, 2020. - Inmates and Sheriff's deputies at the prison are practicing COVID-19 measures including wearing masks, staying keeping a safe distance and doing more frequent cleaning at the facility. (Photo by Sandy Huffaker / AFP) (Photo by SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP via Getty Images) The study by researchers at Northwestern University and the World Bank found that the U.S.’s extremely high rates of incarceration fueled constant “risk of outbreaks” due to the “overcrowded” condition of jails and the cycle of inmates and guards moving between facilities and their home communities.  Researchers analyzed data from 1,605 counties (representing 72% of the U.S. population) and through comparing their coronavirus outcomes to their reductions of jail populations estimated an 80% reduction in incarceration nationwide could have yielded a 2% drop in the growth rate of daily Covid-19 cases.  The 2% reduction, which researchers described as a conservative estimate, may seem small, but when compounded daily “would translate to the prevention of millions of cases” and tens of thousands of deaths, Dr. Eric Reinhart, one of the study’s researchers from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told NPR. Such a drop in the national incarceration rate could be reached by finding “alternatives to incarceration” for nonviolent offenses, the study’s authors said, as data compiled by the Prison Policy Initiative shows most held in local jails and federal facilities are nonviolent offenders, versus around 45% in state prisons.  The impact of reducing incarceration would have the greatest impact on communities of color, as Reinhart said the spread of Covid-19 from jails “likely accounts for a substantial proportion of the racial disparities that have emerged” during the pandemic. 220,000. That’s how many full-time jail staff commute between their communities and work each day, according to the study, highlighting that around 200,000 detainees also cycle through U.S. jail facilities every week.  The researchers also looked at how reducing incarceration compared to other anti-contagion policies in terms of reducing the daily growth rate of Covid-19 cases in these counties. It found the biggest reductions were driven by nursing home visitation bans (7.3%), school closures (4.3%) and mask mandates (2.5%). This makes wearing masks in public places only about 0.5% more effective as a coronavirus mitigation measure than slashing prison populations, according to this analysis.  “The results of this study suggest that jail decarceration and several anticontagion policies—nursing home and prison visitation prohibitions, school closures, and mask mandates—were associated with the prevention of a large number of COVID-19 cases. These policies may have been even more successful if implemented more widely,” the researchers wrote.  In the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, both prisons and jails saw significant decreases in the number of people held as many places moved to release non-violent offenders. A June report by the Vera Institute of Justice found that by the middle of last year, the number of people incarcerated in jails was the lowest it had been in more than two decades: 185,000 compared to 758,000 before the pandemic. However, the decrease did not last long and jail populations have been creeping toward pre-pandemic levels even as the delta variant continues to drive major Covid-19 surges, analysis by The Marshall Project shows. Prisons and jails have continued to be hotspots for the virus, with more than one in five prisoners in the U.S. having been infected by this point. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/02/drastically-reducing-jail-population-could-curb-covid-nearly-as-much-as-mask-mandates-study-says/,"Drastically Reducing Jail Population Could Curb Covid Nearly As Much As Mask Mandates, Study Says"
"RED NOTICE - (L-R) RYAN REYNOLDS, GAL GADOT and DWAYNE ‘THE ROCK’ JOHNSON STAR IN NETFLIX’S RED NOTICE RELEASING NOVEMBER 12, 2021. WRITTEN & DIRECTED BY RAWSON MARSHALL THURBER. Cr: Frank Masi/NETFLIX © 2021 When you’re Netflix and spending around $200 million on a new action/heist caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, you don’t take the opportunity to let these big-deal movie stars color outside the lines. At least that’s the impression offered up by the first trailer for Rawson Marshall Thurber’s Red Notice. At least as much as any early STX movie, the flick (originally intended as a theatrical Universal offering before they got jitters and Netflix grabbed the whole package) is selling big movie stars in exactly the kind of roles which made them stars in the first place. The old-school biggie offers up Dwayne Johnson as the ripped and determined FBI agent who won’t let a little carnal interest get in the way of his collar. You’ve got Gal Gadot as the slippery jewel thief who may be a femme fatale or may be a more powerful crime boss. Ryan Reynolds is an unwilling participant, holding his own as an action sidekick and sarcastically pointing out the absurdities. That two of these folks are playing loose variations on their Fast & Furious characters while Reynolds goes “Van Wilder as international art thief highlights the “comfort watch” nature of this project. Whether Universal ducked out because the movie was getting too expensive for a project that looks more like The Thomas Crown Affair than Hobbs & Shaw or whether they just didn’t like the script as much as the pitch, the film does look explicitly like a throwback to a generation or two ago when big movie stars in big-budget action/adventure comedies with a decent high concept was enough to get butts into theater seats. While the movie doesn’t seem all that spectacular, I liked Thurber’s Central Intelligence quite a bit and, because it’s a Netflix original, everyone is going to sample it anyway. Red Notice debuts on the streaming giant on November 12, which now has zero major theatrical releases thanks to Ghostbusters: Afterlife moving to November 19 after Top Gun: Maverick fled to May 27, 2022. I was surprised last week that Netflix didn’t opt to give this one a brief theatrical window, but a week before November 12 would have been concurrent with the November 5 debut of Eternals. Still, even as a marketing gimmick, it wouldn’t be the worst idea for Netflix to fill what could be a big vacuum with a concurrent theatrical/streaming debut for this “like Hollywood used to make” would-be streaming tentpole.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/02/netflix-red-notice-trailer-gal-gadot-dwayne-johnson-ryan-reynolds-sex-violence-comedy/,"‘Red Notice’ Trailer: Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson And Ryan Reynolds Provide Sex, Violence And Comedy"
"A Republican-led effort to oust Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom from office is very likely to fail, according to a poll released Thursday, which found more than half of Californians still approve of his job performance despite criticism of some of his decisions during the Covid pandemic. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) speaks during a news conference at the California State Capitol on ... [+] March 13, 2019, in Sacramento, California.  The poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found only 39% of Californians plan to vote in favor of recalling Newsom, while 58% plan to vote against. There is a massive split along partisan lines when it comes to the recall—90% of Democrats said they're against the recall, more than enough to overshadow the 82% of Republicans living in the solidly blue state who are in favor of removal. Independents are right in the middle, with 49% saying they don't plan on voting in favor of a recall. Overall, Newsom has a 53% approval rating, according to the poll. The poll surveyed 1,706 California adults between August 20 to August 29. Californians are voting on two items on their recall ballots. First, whether the governor should be recalled at all, and secondly, who should replace him if more than 50% vote for a recall. Since the first vote is unlikely to reach a majority, voting on a replacement will likely be a moot point. Still, polling found conservative radio personality Larry Elder the most likely candidate to replace Newsom in the unlikely event of a recall, gathering 26% support in the poll. The highly publicized campaign of Olympic gold medalist turned reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner isn't making much of an impact, though. Jenner gathered just 1% of support. Newsom faced sharp GOP criticism for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, with Republicans saying the state’s restrictions—which were among the strictest in the country—harmed businesses, though it’s unclear how much impact the lockdowns themselves had on the California economy. But one event in particular seemed to propel calls for Newsom's removal—a large party Newsom attended at the posh restaurant The French Laundry during November in Napa Valley. Photos showed a large, maskless indoor gathering at the restaurant, which was in violation of the state’s Covid guidelines at the time. Republicans, upset with the perceived hypocrisy, would go on to successfully gather enough signatures for a recall election, with the election date set for September 14. The state’s tax rates and problems with homelessness were also cited as reasons for the recall petition, which started being circulated in February 2020, just before pandemic-related shutdowns impacted the state. 4.7 million. That's around how many mail-in ballots have already been cast in the recall election. Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one in the process so far, with registered Democrats returning 2.5 million of the ballots so far, compared to only 1.1 million from Republicans. This is only the second gubernatorial recall election to take place in California history. The first, in 2003, was successful, with Democrat Gray Davis removed from office and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger chosen to replace him.

"Kova founder Rachel Benyola with her foldable helmet. Two years ago, when Forbes held its Under 30 Summit in Detroit, Rachel Benyola, founder of Kova by AnneeLondon, demoed her bike helmet, which folded like origami. She bounded onto the stage wearing it, and took it off to demonstrate how the design—still being tested—worked. She was a surprise hit of the Manufacturing stage. “I remember everyone clapping for me when I said I was going to build it in the United States,” she recalls. But entrepreneurship isn’t easy, and Benyola, now 33, shuttered her company last year, selling off the parts she could, after struggling to raise funds and keep it going during the pandemic. The decision, she says now, was painful, but crucial for her own mental health. She decided to share her own story because she believes it could help other founders facing similar struggles. “I was not taking time off, and I was not taking care of myself, and it hit me a little too late where I was struggling with chronic migraines and not getting out of bed,” she says. “The company was running on empty because I was running on empty.” “There is a toxic positivity of startup culture. People say, ‘Don’t give up, keep it going.’ It became kind of dangerous.”  Back in 2016, Benyola, who has a bachelor’s degree from Rutgers, was motivated to start the Philadelphia-based company by seeing friends who refused to wear helmets due to their bulk and inconvenience. Benyola, an avid biker herself, had been in accidents. One friend was blinded in an eye. The design for the helmet, which she called Kova, was packable and convenient. It contoured to the head with hinges, and folded down, origami-style. Benyola filed a patent for it, and raised roughly $500,000 in seed funding from investors. The design was beautiful, and she garnered attention, landing on our radar in 2017 for the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list. But making a new bike helmet is hard. It needs to be certified to be safe in all weather conditions, and then produced at scale. She put everything she had into the company, loading up her credit cards with debt and even selling off personal items to raise cash. By the time she made the cut for the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Manufacturing, she was seriously struggling. “The day I got a letter that I got on the Forbes Under 30 list was the same day I was approved for food stamps,” she recalls. “I was really excited about both.” In winter 2019, she started pitching investors in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland. She says a few (whom she declines to name) were interested, but they got cold feet when the pandemic hit in the spring. “In two weeks, I got phone calls or emails from these investment funds saying, ‘It’s nothing personal, but we’re going to hold off investing in anything new for the foreseeable future,’” she says. “I was super discouraged, but was like, ‘Let’s figure out what we can do.’” Then in late March, she started to feel sick. Soon, she and her boyfriend (now husband) were diagnosed with Covid-19. “During those months I was at home, I had to face the thing I didn’t want to face: Is this something I want to keep doing, this uphill battle of bringing this product to market? It was such a hard decision and choice to come to terms with,” she says.  Months passed as she recovered from illness and came to terms with her decision. She gardened to stay calm, but the stress of not having funds or health insurance weighed heavily. “Stressful doesn’t describe it adequately. I was going to startup events, and one guy told me he was living in his car and another guy said he was living in the utility closet of his friend’s office.” she says. “Everyone is in debt, but publicly we are expected to be so charismatic, super-positive, portraying success. There is a toxic positivity of startup culture. People say, ‘Don’t give up, keep it going.’ It became kind of dangerous.” The design of the Kova helmet countered to the head—and folded up for easy carrying. By summer she was done, and spoke with her investors about the decision. She says she cried when they told her they’d invest with her again. She dissolved the corporate entity, and sold off the assets she could to different manufacturing partners. The cash helped cover some of the debts, and pay some expenses. But she also learned that her patent had gone into an abandoned state because of not keeping current on filings due to lack of cash. In an email to supporters this spring, she told them there’d be no refunds for pre-orders. “The payment has gone towards the extensive research and development of the helmet,” she wrote. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support.” What’s next? Benyola, who has a master’s degree in clinical psychology from Chestnut Hill College, is now doing executive coaching, working with individuals and startups, and helping them learn from her experience. “I do enjoy working with different startups, and I’ve been talking with some venture funds and incubators about how we can build in these wellness audits,” she says. “I’m starting to come out of my shell.”     ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/09/02/how-an-under-30-alum-decided-to-shutter-her-bike-helmet-startup-to-focus-on-her-own-mental-health/,How An Under 30 Alum Decided To Shutter Her Bike Helmet Startup To Focus On Her Own Mental Health
"President Joe Biden’s approval rating slipped six points from August to 43%, according to a new Marist National Poll with NPR and PBS Newshour, marking the lowest rating for Biden since he took office and highlighting the public’s dissatisfaction with the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 02: President Joe Biden delivers remarks on his administrations response ... [+] to Hurricane Ida at the South Court Auditorium on the White House Complex on Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) The poll of 1,200 people between August 26-31, with a margin of error of 3.8%, found only 43% said they approve of the job Biden is doing, with 51% disapproving, and 7% unsure. Biden’s approval rating in Marist National Polls had hovered between 49% and 54% since he became president, with 43% the lowest mark so far. Biden’s approval rating saw the biggest dip among independent voters, with just 36% saying they approve of the job he’s doing, down from 46% a month ago, and among Democrats, his approval rating slipped five percentage points. A majority of adults polled (61%) disapproved how Biden handled the withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many Republicans (94%) and Independents (71%) and a quarter of Democrats (25%) saying they disapproved. About 71% of Americans thought the U.S.’s role in Afghanistan was a failure, something a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents agree on. The Marist National Poll is the latest in a series of recent polling released over the past few weeks showing a downturn of approval toward Biden, mostly spurred by his recent  handling of the U.S.’s evacuation from Afghanistan following the Taliban’s quick take over of the country. An Associated Press-NORC poll two weeks ago also showed a dip in Biden’s approval rating by nine percentage points, from 63% to 54%. Growing coronavirus cases in the nation due to the highly transmissible delta variant could also play a role in Biden’s approval rating. A Gallup Poll taken in early August released last week showed that just 23% of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going in the U.S., with many saying coronavirus was the most pressing concern. The poll also found that Americans are split about how  Biden should have handled Afghanistan, with 38% believing the U.S. should have withdrawn but left some troops, 37% believing the U.S. should have withdrawn completely and 10% saying U.S. troops should have stayed in Afghanistan. A majority of Americans (69%) also believe Afghanistan should stand on its own without U.S. involvement, while 29% say the U.S. should continue its involvement with the nation. Almost three-quarters of Americans (73%) also say they support Afghan refugees to come into the country.  Biden’s Approval Rating Dips To Lowest Level Of Presidency In AP-NORC Poll (Forbes) U.S. Satisfaction Hits Record Low In Biden Presidency Amid Delta Surge, Poll Finds—But Republicans Still Don’t View Covid As Major Threat (Forbes)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/09/02/biden-approval-rating-drops-to-lowest-following-afghanistan-withdrawal-poll-finds/,"Biden Approval Rating Drops To Lowest Following Afghanistan Withdrawal, Poll Finds"
"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Marvel Studios' SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. Photo by Jasin ... [+] Boland. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved. By this time tomorrow, we’ll be dissecting the Thursday preview numbers for Disney and Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (review). Fingers are crossed that Destin Daniel Cretton’s MCU action fantasy can notch something approximating a solid opening weekend (over/under $100 million worldwide would be nice) as it launches over the Fri-Mon Labor Day frame. With solid reviews, strong buzz, presumably decent word-of-mouth (I can’t imagine general audiences not somewhat enjoying it) and a month before No Time to Die on October 8, the film has some room to breathe even if it doesn’t set the box office on fire this weekend.  And yet, even noting the obvious Covid curve (and climate change-related variables) at play, this “only in theaters” release has a skewed shot at setting two contradictory box office records. It could score both the biggest Labor Day weekend launch of all time while also nabbing the lowest opening ever for an MCU movie. If it opens above $31 million over the Fri-Sun frame, it’ll set a new Labor Day weekend milestone. If it opens below $55 million over the Fri-Sun portion of its Fri-Mon debut, it’ll nab the lowest MCU opening weekend yet recorded. All parties would rather achieve “option A” while avoiding “Option B.”  Labor Day is easily the slowest holiday weekend of the year. In normal circumstances. Labor Day usually marks the end of the summer movie season, with a B-movie opener (or a star-driven thriller aimed at adults) doing its thing alongside the last biggies of the summer. Just seven movies have opened above even $15 million on this “end of summer/start of school” weekend, namely Jeepers Creepers, The American, Jeepers Creepers 2, One Direction: This is Us, Transporter 2, The Possession and Halloween. Rob Zombie’s Halloween set the Labor Day record in 2007 with a $26.5 million Fri-Sun/$30.5 million Fri-Mon opening weekend. The critically-panned horror movie remake (which still had plenty of interest and a killer teaser trailer) earned $57 million domestic, a Labor Day release benchmark that was barely passed last year by Tenet. Chris Nolan’s would be multiplex-revival flick (think jumping a car battery) that wasn’t opened with just $20.2 million over an 11-day Labor Day week debut (including $9.4 million over the Fri-Sun frame). It only topped Halloween’s $57.25 million cume after finally opening in Los Angeles on its 30th weekend in late March 2021.  When factoring inflation, the top Labor Day weekend domestic releases are Fast Times at Ridgemont High ($27 million in 1982 and $83 million adjusted for inflation), Dead Again ($38 million in 1991/$82 million adjusted), Halloween ($57 million in 2007/$73 million adjusted) and Tenet ($58 million in 2020). I’m guessing Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which is aiming for a Fri-Mon debut on par with Ant-Man’s $58 million Fri-Sun debut (and could nab a four-day debut closer to Black Widow’s $80 million launch), will easily pass all of these benchmarks to become the undisputed (by default) Labor Day weekend champ.  Meanwhile, the lowest Fri-Sun opening weekends (sans inflation) for any Marvel Cinematic Universe film remain the $55 million Fri-Sun launch of The Incredible Hulk in June of 2008 ($72 million adjusted for inflation) and the $58 million Fri-Sun debut of Ant-Man in July of 2015 ($64 million adjusted). The Incredible Hulk earned just $132 million domestic and $267 million on a $155 million budget, remaining Marvel’s only unmitigated flop. Ant-Man earned 3.15x its opening weekend. The $130 million Paul Rudd flick would notch $180 million domestic and $520 million worldwide. Both MCU “low marks” provide context for the Simu Lui/Awkwafina/Tony Leung fantasy epic.  The failure of The Incredible Hulk (a “general audiences” revamp after Ang Lee’s arty Hulk which then earned near-identical grosses) was barely a bump on the road to The Avengers. The Universal flick opened a month after Iron Man, which was itself such a success ($318 million domestic/$585 million on a $140 million budget) that nobody cared about Hulk 2.0. Thor still earned $449 million worldwide in summer 2011 (a then-record for a non-Iron Man/Batman/Wolverine/Spider-Man comic book superhero movie) and The Avengers (with Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner) still earned a game-changing $623 million domestic/$1.5 billion worldwide in summer 2012.  Even if Shang-Chi outright tanks this weekend and doesn’t leg out, the enterprise is not without value. Ant-Man earned “just” $519 million in 2015, but Paul Rudd’s winning Scott Lang earned cheers when he showed up in Captain America: Civil War and when he starred in Avengers: Endgame. Ditto Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange, which “just” $677 million worldwide. The Sorcerer Supreme had a very funny Thor: Ragnarok cameo and starred alongside Robert Downey Jr. in Avengers: Infinity War. Simu Liu and Awkwafina’s cheerful protagonists are engrossing enough to win over fans who will be more than happy to see them in either Shang-Chi 2 or somebody else’s MCU movie.  Shang-Chi absolutely would have been a solid commercial hit had it opened sans Covid. And it’s good enough and crowdpleasing enough to further the “Marvel is still doing okay after Endgame” narrative. It is possible that the Simu Liu actioner will open just high enough to avoid situational infamy. Like Tenet, Wonder Woman 1984 and In the Heights, a demographically-specific event film (starring a “not a white guy” protagonist”) has been shouldered with the burden of essentially saving theatrical movies, or at least the current slate of late-2021 releases. That is both bitterly ironic and entirely unfair, but it is true nonetheless.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/02/shang-chi-labor-day-box-office-records-marvel-disney-tenet-halloween/,‘Shang-Chi’ Could Break Two New Contradictory Box Office Records
"Goldfish's partnership with JNCO features embroidery and oversize pockets for bags of the product. These aren’t your mother’s Goldfish crackers.  The ubiquitous snack that smiles back was introduced in 1958 by Oscar J. Kambly, who invented it for his wife. The brand is now celebrating the Nineties with a limited-time taste makeover bowing on September 1.  “Nineties nostalgia is incredibly popular right now,” Janda Lukin, chief marketing officer of Campbell’s Snacks told me. “Our food trends research revealed that hot and spicy is the most requested flavor for Goldfish, particularly among young adults. Digging deeper, we discovered that the spicy, cheesy jalapeño popper was trademarked in 1992.” “When deciding on our next flavor, we immediately thought of our favorite snack from the era, jalapeño poppers,” added Danielle Brown, vice president of marketing for Campbell Snacks. “In bringing this iconic flavor to life, nothing put a smile on our faces like creating the ultimate Nineties combo of a pair of jeans with a bag of Jalapeño Popper Goldfish peeking out of each pocket.” The new flavor offers “a bold, cheesy taste with a slight kick of heat, and combines the premium quality crackers fans know and love with the nostalgic snack from the Nineties,” Campbell’s said. Consumers can get the immersive Nineties Goldfish experience and wear their passion for the snack on their pants with a pair of JNCO jeans. Goldfish partnered with the jean company, which had its heyday in the Nineties. JNCO designed what the brand is calling the ultimate snacking accessory – limited-edition Goldfish Jalapeño Poppers JNCO Snack Pants.  The wide-leg style jean features oversize pockets that will fit a bag of Jalapeño Poppers Goldfish, and each pair conveniently comes with its own 6.6-ounce bag. Food and fashion have a long history of collaboration. Most consumers are too young to remember Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí’s sartorial contribution, an A-line gown designed in 1937 by Elsa Schiaparelli with a lobster in the middle of the skirt. More recently, Anti Social Social Club slapped its designs on T-shirts and hoodies for Panda Express, highlighting the mall-based purveyor of Chinese fast food’s popular orange chicken dish. Iconic soft drink giant Coco-Cola in 2017 partnered with streetwear’s A Bathing Ape, infusing the latter’s cameo pattern with Coke’s trademark shade of red on limited edition Tees, button-down shirts, polo shirts and caps, as well as a G-Sock watchband. Why all the fashion forays into tasty territory? For one thing, food and fashion fusions bring attention to both parties and can energize sleepy brands. They can also reel in new customers and supply additional revenue streams, albeit for the short term. “This is our first fashion collaboration,” Lukin said. “We’ve had other collaborations in the past with Frank’s Red Hot sauce and Disney. There’s a natural connection between snacking and fashion. Both celebrate having fun and creating and enjoying new experiences.” The collaboration features designs for men and women. JNCO was a phenomenon in the Nineties when the brand hit the fashion scene hard. “JNCO wide leg jeans captured the imagination of a whole generation,” the brand says on its web site. “With a brilliant team of designers, illustrators, graffiti artists, and cartoonists, we were able to present extraordinary jeans with each pair expressing an individual identity through name, styling flasher, embroidery and graphics.  “The best proof of this legacy is our loyal followers, who through the years collected and traded these amazing jeans,” said JNCO cofounder Milo Revah. “My brother Jacques and I, and now with my daughter Camilla, are very proud and grateful for the longstanding appreciation and support. We’re now on the second leg of this incredible journey.” In a new commercial for the snack, a teen is leaning against a playground fence when a couple approaches. “Jalapeno Poppers, those were huge in the Nineties,” says the woman excitedly. “As huge as Nineties pants,” says the man, noticing the boy’s jeans. “Oh, these pants? These aren’t Nineties pants, they’re Jalapeño Popper Goldfish pants. They’re nothing like Nineties pants.”  “So those big Nineties pockets?” the man in the commercial says. ‘’I'm pretty sure they’re Nineties pants.’’ “They’re Jalapeño Pocket Goldfish pants,” says the teen again. “Handful?” “Don’t mind if I do,” says the man, as he reaches his hand into a bag in the young man’s back pocket. “Go for a handful of the Nineties,” is the tag line. Print ads feature copy such as, “Huge Nineties pockets finally explained.”  The limited-edition flavor will be available at major retailers where Goldfish is sold, for a suggested retail price of $2.69 per 6.6-ounce bag. The limited-edition Goldfish Jalapeño Popper JNCO jeans can be purchased from JNCO’s web site. Asked what flavor and era Goldfish might tap next, Lukins said, “The verdict is still out, but we’re always looking for ways to surprise and delight our fans. As we develop flavors, we continue to be inspired by consumer feedback and trends.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/09/02/goldfish-snack-crackers-takes-a-stylish-90s-trip-down-memory-lane/,Goldfish Snack Crackers Takes A Stylish 90’s Trip Down Memory Lane

In contrast, Hochul said she’d do her work away from the cameras and without PowerPoint presentations. “To the people that live on streets like these throughout the City of New York, I want them to know, a new administration, my administration, we don’t govern by press conference.” “I served as a council member for 14 years,” Hochul said. “I know what it takes to get the job done. You don’t just show up one day, you show up until the job is done.” There was another noteworthy moment during the news conference—when a New York City councilman’s phone rang audibly as he stood at the lectern. “I bet you this is my mother. Every time you get to a mic,” he said, handing the phone to the governor, who answered it. “Mom, your son’s doing okay, he’s doing a press conference,” Hochul said. “We’ve got your little boy in good hands.” ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2021/09/02/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-hits-cuomo-we-dont-govern-by-press-conference/,New York Governor Kathy Hochul Hits Cuomo: ‘We Don’t Govern By Press Conference’
"The House Armed Services Committee on Thursday voted to advance a provision giving the mayor of Washington, D.C. the power to call up the district’s National Guard troops, a significant security reform in response to the deadly Capitol riot in January, which comes as law enforcement in the district are raising alarm bells about future unrest. Members of the DC National Guard are deployed outside of the US Capitol in Washington DC on January ... [+] 6, 2021. - Trump supporters remain outside, defying a 6.00 pm (2300 GMT) curfew imposed across the city by Mayor Muriel Bowser. Donald Trump's supporters stormed a session of Congress held today, January 6, to certify Joe Biden's election win, triggering unprecedented chaos and violence at the heart of American democracy and accusations the president was attempting a coup. (Photo by Andrew CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) The measure, introduced by Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), would hand control of the D.C. National Guard from the president and secretary of the army to the mayor, the same power enjoyed by state and territorial governors. Norton said in a statement the mayor has the “best knowledge and most reliable expertise” on when to deploy the guard, arguing that, had Mayor Muriel Bowser been able to call them up on January 6, the Capitol riot would have ended “hours earlier.” The provision is part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a “must-pass” annual defense spending bill that was advanced by a panel vote of 57-2 early Thursday morning and sent to the full House, where it is expected to pass easily. Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.) introduced an amendment to the NDAA to kill the provision, suggesting it would overcomplicate the chain of command and potentially slow response time, but Democrats voted it down along party lines. The measure is a victory for D.C. in its long push-and-pull with Congress over home rule and devolved powers, but it’s also a direct response to the security failings that facilitated the Capitol riot. Bowser had already requested several hundred troops to support D.C. police a week before January 6, but a complex and “opaque” approval process in which the Department of Defense must be petitioned for National Guard assistance to D.C. contributed to a hours-long delay in mobilizing additional troops after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, according to a Senate report released in June.  12. That’s the number of times Capitol Police, D.C. police and local officials requested National Guard support on January 6, according to documents released by the House Oversight Committee in June, which found the first request, from Bowser, was at 1:34 p.m. but that it wasn’t approved until 4:32 p.m. and troops didn’t arrive until 5:20 p.m. “Every city with a population of around a million does not need to have a national guard at their disposal. If we do then Memphis gets one, Los Angeles gets a national guard that is answerable to their mayor. There is a difference between a mayor and a governor,” Kelly said in opposition to the measure.  The Armed Services Committee also approved an amendment from Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) to prohibit governors from sending their National Guard troops to other states and territories without the consent of those jurisdictions. The move comes after the Trump administration took the unprecedented and widely-criticized step of deploying guardsmen from 11 states to D.C. to respond to protests against police violence last summer. Law enforcement is sounding alarm bells that January 6 may not be the last time Trump-inspired unrest grips the district. Capitol Police chief Tom Manger told Forbes in a statement his department is “closely monitoring” a demonstration planned for September 18 to protest the imprisonment of Capitol riot defendants.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/09/02/house-panel-approves-giving-dc-mayor-control-of-national-guard-in-major-post-jan-6-reform/,House Panel Approves Giving D.C.

" After days of rapid growth, the Caldor wildfire finally slowed down overnight on Wednesday, giving firefighters a chance to make progress in containing the blaze as officials project weather conditions for the rest of the week look promising to put out the fire. A snow machine blows water on a structure at Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort as the Caldor fire moved ... [+] through the area Monday. California fire officials said Thursday morning that thanks to increased humidity and slowing winds overnight, the wildfire did not spread as much Wednesday evening into Thursday morning as it did in previous days. The fire had reached 210,250 acres on Thursday and had been 25% contained, a five-point jump from the previous day despite the fire’s growth, marking notable progress by firefighters overnight. Weather forecasts indicate conditions could remain more humid and less windy for the rest of the week, officials said, which would bode well for response teams trying to contain the wildfires after days of dry conditions and gusty winds accelerated the fire’s spread. While five people have been injured in the fire, no additional injuries have been reported since Monday and officials have reported no deaths. The Caldor fire has been burning for nearly three weeks since it first started east of Sacramento. Since then, it has been pushed east, triggering evacuation warnings and orders in both northern California and along the border of Nevada. For now, the fire has largely avoided the most populated areas around Lake Tahoe, which would typically be filled with tourists but was evacuated starting last week. More than 40,000 residents and visitors have fled.

"McCree is getting a name change. One option seems at least sort of likely. One of the original Overwatch characters, Jesse McCree, is getting a name change. That’s because he was named after the real life Jesse McCree, an ex-Blizzard employee who left the company as part of the ongoing cleansing that’s occurred since the state of California filed its discrimination lawsuit. McCree was one of the men shown in the “Cosby suite” pictures, a hotel room at BlizzCon used as a party room with dubious implications. So the name change makes sense and maybe ought to also serve as a cautionary tale against naming video game characters after real people in the future. What that name will be remains an open question, but one theory I’ve seen floating around is that Jesse McCree will be named Joel McCloud. This was actually the character’s original name back when he was just a concept, before Overwatch launched. Concept art for Overwatch As you can see, many of Overwatch’s OG characters used to be named something else (image via). Some remained the same—Symmetra and Mercy, though Mercy looks nothing like her final character. Others we’ve never seen, like the spiky-headed, Kratos-clone Luc. We never got Firestarter, either, which is too bad. And Ironclad became the much harder to spell, but also much cooler, Torbjörn. Meanwhile, McCloud was a Scottish highlander who, quite frankly, I would really like to see as an Overwatch character. Sadly, there’s not much likelihood that the pistol-wielding cowboy will become a claymore-wielding highlander, but it does seem at least possible that McCree will become McCloud. It’s a similar enough name, after all, and it pays homage to the original concept. It’s also the name of another famous video game character: Fox McCloud of Star Fox fame. So that’s fun. In any case, we’ll find out the actual name change later this year. Activision-Blizzard remain under intense scrutiny as the California lawsuit continues to shine a light on sexual harassment and inequality in the video game industry.

"South Dakota is experiencing a jump in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations after this year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally many times greater than seen at the same point after last year’s superspreader event, an analysis of state data shows.  STURGIS, SOUTH DAKOTA - AUGUST 08: Motorcycle enthusiasts pose for a group photo during the 81st ... [+] annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on August 8, 2021 in Sturgis, South Dakota. The rally is expect to draw more than 500,00 people during its 10-day run. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) South Dakota’s daily coronavirus cases have increased 685% from an average of 54 when the rally began on August 6 to 424 as of September 1, according to a tracker run by The New York Times.  New infections had only jumped by about 260% by this point after last year’s rally, which yielded a fraction of the estimated 700,000-person turnout of last month’s event due to pandemic restrictions, increasing from an average of 87 new daily cases the day the rally began to 313 at the start of September.  Hospitalizations are also outpacing the increase seen after last year’s rally, topping 200 with at least 40 on ventilators as of August 31, the largest number since mid-January.  Meanwhile, some 85 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across South Dakota as of August 31, 2020, The New York Times data shows.  New daily deaths are almost the same as they were at this point last year (an average of 1.4 per day compared to 0.9 in 2020), though this metric is known to lag and can take weeks to catch up to upticks in cases and hospitalizations.  Though cases were ticking upwards before the start of the rally, it was nowhere near the rate that they have been increasing in the weeks since. Cases and hospitalizations have both jumped by more than 100% each state-wide over the past two weeks, data compiled by The New York Times shows.  The coronavirus surge has impacted counties that were previously reporting very few cases, a recent analysis by the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Argus Leader found. Pennington County, which neighbors Meade County, where the city of Sturgis is located, has seen Covid-19 cases increase from three per day at the start of July to almost 160. Meanwhile, the surrounding Black Hills region, which had very few active cases in early July, now houses more than half of the state’s intensive care patients with Covid-19, according to the Argus Leader. Many of these counties have vaccination rates below the state’s average of 49%. For example, inoculation rates range from 26% to 39% across the Black Hills region. South Dakota Department of Health spokesperson Daniel Bucheli highlighted last week that 97% of all new South Dakota Covid-19 cases, 93% of hospitalizations and 95% of deaths are among unvaccinated people.  Bucheli suggested to NBC News that the virus spikes are “following a national trend being experienced in every state” as opposed to being. aconsequence of the rally, which ended August 15.  South Dakota saw a big uptick in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations after last year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which reportedly attracted more than 365,000 people for the 10-day event. The state did not (and still does not have) any coronavirus restrictions in place, such as mask or vaccination mandates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ultimately linked 649 Covid-19 cases to last year’s event, though one study released weeks after the event suggested it may have caused more than 250,000.  South Dakota Gov.

"President Joe Biden directed his administration Thursday to take steps to combat Texas’ law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected—the most extreme abortion restrictions imposed in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade—after the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court let the law stand late Wednesday night in a 5-4 ruling. U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the White House on August 31. Biden slammed the Supreme Court’s ruling as an “unprecedented assault on a woman’s constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade,” the landmark 1973 ruling that enshrined the right to an abortion, and said in a statement the decision “unleashes unconstitutional chaos.” The president called for an “immediate response” to the law and directed his administration’s Gender Policy Council and the Office of the White House Counsel to “launch a whole-of-government effort” to take action to counteract the Texas law. The effort will specifically look at what steps the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can take to provide abortion access to Texans and what “legal tools” can be used to fight against the law. The Supreme Court declining to strike down the law “without a hearing, without the benefit of an opinion from a court below, and without due consideration of the issues, insults the rule of law and the rights of all Americans to seek redress from our courts,” Biden said. “Rather than use its supreme authority to ensure justice could be fairly sought, the highest Court of our land will allow millions of women in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities.” Texas’ abortion law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), prohibits all abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected—typically around six weeks into a pregnancy—except in cases of medical emergencies. Unlike other states’ abortion bans that have been struck down by the courts, SB 8 attempts to avoid legal scrutiny by putting the onus on private citizens to enforce the law rather than government officials. The law stipulates citizens can bring lawsuits against anyone that “aids and abets” an abortion and recover at least $10,000 in damages if they’re successful. After abortion advocacy groups asked the Supreme Court to strike down the law while litigation against it played out, the court ruled it was too soon to do so, but did not rule on the actual constitutionality of the law itself and said legal challenges against the law can still be brought in the future. In a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the justices in the majority had “opted to bury their heads in the sand” by upholding the “flagrantly unconstitutional law.” 85%. That’s the percentage of abortions in Texas that are expected to now be banned under SB 8, the abortion advocacy groups said in their petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. Abortion providers in Texas told reporters Wednesday they are remaining open for abortions before a fetal heartbeat is detected that comply with the law, but there are concerns the law could put a severe strain on them or force some to close due to the expected flood of costly litigation from private citizens. The law is also expected to severely restrict abortion access for Texans, with the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute finding Texans seeking abortions will now have to travel approximately 20 times as far to obtain one as they did before SB 8 took effect, with an average distance of 248 miles one way. In addition to the White House, Congress has also vowed to take steps to combat Texas’ abortion ban. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement the chamber would take up the Women’s Health Protection Act when it returns from its August recess, which would enshrine the right to an abortion into federal law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said before the Supreme Court’s ruling Democrats would “fight against SB 8 and for Roe v. Wade,” but has not promised any specific actions yet.

DeSantis still has strong support among the GOP base, with more than four in five Florida Republicans saying they still approve of the governor, although that number dipped slightly since the beginning of July, from 87% to 83%. Among all voters, DeSantis’ net approval rating has plunged 14 percentage points over the past two months. In Texas, 48% of independent voters said they disapproved of Abbot in early July, but that number has now risen to 54%. Abbot’s net approval rating has decreased by 7% overall, but his approval rate among Republicans dropped just one percentage point.  By the last week in August, more than 23,000 new cases of Covid-19 were being reported in Florida daily, which was roughly 30% higher than the state’s previous peak in January. Hospitalizations and Covid-related deaths also hit all-time highs as the delta variant wreaked havoc in the Sunshine State. Texas was also dealing with a dangerous spike in late August, averaging in excess of 17,000 daily infections for the first time since early February. These summer surges, and the governors’ responses to Covid-19 crises, may have impacted voter’s views toward DeSantis and Abbott. Although DeSantis was an early advocate of vaccines, he has adamantly opposed mask mandates, including in schools. “We can either have a free society, or we can have a biomedical security state,” DeSantis proclaimed. “And I can tell you: Florida, we’re a free state. People are going to be free to choose to make their own decisions.” However, last week, a Florida court ruled the state’s school districts may impose strict mask mandates on students to limit the spread of the virus. In July, Abbott issued an executive order banning mask mandates and other operating mandates in Texas. Both Florida and Texas have efforts to prohibit institutions from requiring vaccinations. In early August, President Joe Biden criticized DeSantis and Abbott for failing to adequately protect the public from the virus. “I say to these governors: Please help, but if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way,” Biden said. “The people are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.” DeSantis will be up for reelection next November. He is also expected to announce a run for the presidency at some point in the future. A nationwide poll of Republican voters taken in July found he would be considered the front-runner if Donald Trump does not run again. “The delta variant is exceptional at finding vulnerable populations,” said Jason L. Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida. 44,571. That’s the number of people that have been killed by Covid-19 in Florida over the past 18 months.

" Starting today, anyone with an internet connection and a console or PC will be able to play Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War for free.  Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War was released in 2020 and since then I’ve put in countless hours playing multiplayer with my friends. While I was skeptical about the game at first, it’s become my favorite Call Of Duty in years, perhaps of all time. Treyarch has done such a great job supporting the game (other than its lousy split-screen) that I expect to be playing it well into the future. Now you can try it out for yourself, for free, over the next six days. Here’s everything you need to know about the free weekend and what to expect. Free Access for Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War kicks off on September 2nd at 10 am PT and runs until Tuesday September 7th at 10 am. That translates to:   The game is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5 and PC via Battle.net. Black Ops This is a Season 5 focused event, so expect a focus on Season 5 content. That includes the new Double Agent mode—basically Among Us in Call of Duty—plus 25 multiplayer maps, 9 different modes and Zombies Outbreak co-op mode. PlayStation gamers will also be able to play Onlsaught Zombies mode, a console exclusive. According to Treyarch, we can also expect: • Multiplayer & Zombies Free Access (Sept. 2-7) • Season Five Moshpit (Echelon, Slums, and Drive-In maps) • New Gunfight Tournament • New Throwback Moshpit (Remastered classic Black Ops maps) • Stryker Operator Bundle ($$$) • Extended 2XP Weekend (Sept. 3-7)  + more The extended 2XP is especially exciting since players will be able to earn double XP toward leveling their weapons, Battle Pass and Prestige level for five days straight.  The return of Gunfight Tournament is also exciting since Gunfight is one of the best new Call of Duty modes (and one of my favorite multiplayer modes in any game) and being able to compete tournament style with special rewards for victory is a lot of fun. For Warzone players, all progress made during the free weekend will carry over to that game which is a nice perk. Treyarch is offering a special: “Free Access players who upgrade to the full version of Black Ops Cold War during the trial will automatically receive the Season Five Battle Pass + Free Tier Skips as a thank-you for joining the fight.

"There are now multiple options to detect and differentiate between Covid-19 and the flu. Dr. Matt Binnicker, an expert in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, explains why testing for both Covid-19 and influenza will be important as we head into the winter months. During the fall and winter months of 2020, something remarkable happened. Although cases of Covid-19 were surging nationwide, there was a near absence of the flu. At Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, almost 20,000 tests for influenza were performed between December 2020 and February 2021 – and not a single test was positive. Nationwide, just over 2,000 flu cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Compare that to nearly 38 million cases of influenza reported during the 2019-2020 season.  This dichotomy highlights the extraordinary impact of human behavior on the spread of infectious diseases. However, the precise explanation for the relative disappearance of influenza in 2020 is likely multifactorial. It’s almost certain that Covid-19 mitigation measures, such as masking and physical distancing, played a key role in disrupting transmission of influenza. But other factors, including the availability of flu vaccines, stay-at-home orders, virtual work and school, and a significant reduction in domestic and international air travel also contributed to historically low flu numbers. As schools and businesses reopen and air travel returns to pre-pandemic volumes, health experts are asking, “Will influenza make a comeback?” Influenza is Still Out There Through August of 2021, the incidence of influenza worldwide continues to be significantly lower compared to historical standards. In the southern hemisphere, Australia experienced a second consecutive year of extremely low influenza rates, with only 462 cases being reported to the Australian Department of Health. Unfortunately, influenza hasn’t disappeared and been replaced by Covid-19 – the flu is still out there, just waiting for us to lower our guard. Medical centers around the United States have observed sporadic cases of influenza during the summer months of 2021. However, there is a high level of uncertainty as to what is in store for the United States in the coming months. Given the relaxed Covid-19 mitigation measures in parts of the country, a resumption in air travel, and the return of many students to in-person learning, it’s likely the U.S. will experience a more significant influenza season compared to 2020. So, what does that mean for testing in the context of an ongoing Covid-19 pandemic?   You’ll Likely be Tested for Covid-19 and Influenza During the first week after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus, the symptoms that may develop are often indistinguishable. Patients may experience body aches, a fever, chills, cough, and fatigue. Despite the similarities in the common symptoms of Covid-19 and the flu, the way that doctors may treat a patient with these infections can vary significantly – and that’s why it’s important to make a diagnosis. Fortunately, there are now multiple options to detect and differentiate between Covid-19 and the flu, sometimes all-in-one test. These tests often use PCR or a similar molecular technology, which looks for the viral RNA genome in an individual’s sample. Because these tests are designed to ‘seek out’ unique parts of the viral genetic code, a patient with Covid-19 won’t test positive for influenza, and vice versa. Testing for both viruses at the same time will allow doctors to optimize a patient’s treatment strategy. For example, if you have the flu, you might be prescribed an antiviral medication like Tamiflu, or Xofluza. In contrast, certain patients who test positive for Covid-19 may receive monoclonal antibody therapy, and if hospitalized, be treated with an antiviral drug (i.e., remdesivir) or corticosteroids. The Outcome of the Upcoming Flu Season is Largely Up to Us The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the impact we have on the spread of infectious diseases. Although many parts of the globe experienced significant reductions in cases of viral diarrhea/vomiting (i.e., the stomach flu) and common colds in 2020, these viruses are storming back. In addition, clinical labs across the U.S. have observed a significant rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this summer, with test positivity rates reaching 20-30% at some centers. RSV usually peaks during the winter months, most often causing a respiratory illness in young children that may require hospitalization. However, reduced adherence to masking and physical distancing, as well as decreased compliance to routine hand-hygiene has opened the door, allowing for viruses, like RSV, to spread.  So how will the upcoming influenza season play out? The answer largely depends on us. If we return to normal and forget the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic, we’ll likely experience increasing flu counts, which will further tax an already weary healthcare system. But if we take a common-sense approach – i.e., staying at home when sick, wearing a mask when in public indoor spaces (including during air travel), and getting vaccinated against Covid-19 and influenza – then we have the opportunity to turn the page on the Covid-19 pandemic and author a healthier future for everyone.

"Memphis guard Jayden Hardaway (1) is one of the first current student athletes to sign with VN ... [+] Sports (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins) Viral Nation, an experienced influencer marketing and talent agency, is launching a new division today focused on cultivating athlete-influencers on the high school and collegiate levels. The new division, VN Sports, is launching with five current and previous college student athletes and three fresh brand deals. Notable athlete influencers that have signed with VN Sports include the sons of two well-known former NBA players: Jayden Hardaway, son of former NBA player and current Memphis basketball head coach Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway, who currently plays for his father’s team and KJ Smith, a former UNC basketball player and son of NBA champion Kenny “The Jet” Smith. Other signings include Belmont soccer player Keely Amelia Cartrett, Clemson football player Braden Galloway, Chicago State basketball player Anthony Hamilton Jr. and UNLV basketball player Jordan McCabe. In all, there are approximately 10 student athletes currently signed but more than 60 contracts out for signature. VN Sports has been working behind the scenes not only to secure exclusive representation of these athlete-influencers but also to land a few deals to include as part of the launch. McCabe and Galloway each have deals with nutrition company Soylent, and Cartrett has inked a deal with Christian singles app Upward. Viral Nation executive vice president Jonathan Chanti says it’s not just about the size of the following these student athletes have on social media but also the quality of their followers that is attracting brands. “What’s special about Jordan McCabe, for example, is actually who is also following him. It’s a lot of celebrities and professional athletes.” That’s not to say, however, that VN Sports is only going to focus on star student athletes that are household names. “Some of the most socially-followed student athletes aren’t the stars of the team,” said Joe Gagliese, CEO and co-founder of Viral Nation. “They’re not the guys who people are wearing their jerseys. Sometimes they’re just the creators, or have really cool video content or some innate ability. So, once they’re school is over they come under the Viral Nation umbrella and we can help them monetize their future and grow outside of a sports perspective.” Gagliese says Viral Nation started building the foundation for VN Sports last year after being approached by the father of a student athlete who was a lawyer and wanted to figure out how to get ahead of NIL. “That’s when we really started to dive into this space. At first, honestly, we were worried schools wouldn’t be able to let go of that monetization. I thought it would be coming off of money that they would no longer be generating, so I was a little worried about how it would turn out if we invested in it. Then in January or February was when we built out the budget and said, ‘Let’s go to town. Let’s go hard, and let’s go wide and big.’” Asked why other established influencer marketing agencies haven’t all jumped into NIL, Chanti said cost is a big deterrent for many. “It’s not cheap. You have to have the right resources. You need legal counsel and platform technology. It does take a substantial amount of strategic investment and resources and know-how.” Gagliese says he sees a future where partnering with student athletes will be the only effective way for advertisers to reach college students.  “I wouldn't’ be surprised if two or three years from now if those student athletes, plus some digital paid media, is the only way to reach those kids inside of that school. The ad block across the United States is insane. They’re doing nothing but streaming platforms and they’re on social. So unless we can infiltrate that world of collegiate marketing, and marketing to young people who are becoming more and more powerful in terms of buying power, this is going to be one of the only ways they can do it.” VN Sports has tapped Mike Lecce as vice president, who has a decade of experience in commercial management and representation of professional athletes, including David' Big Papi' Ortiz, Alex Bregman and Jose Bautista. Lecce will lead recruiting and brand partnerships for the division. The company also pulled in Alonzo ""Roxx"" Thornhill, a marketing expert with a focus in sports medicine and wellness who has worked with professional athletes and celebrities including Drake, Steph Curry and Odell Beckham Jr. Thornhill will assist with brand partnerships as the vice president of talent relations. “He’s friends with all these big athletes, so there’s a trust factor there but also relatability,” Gagliese said of Thornhill.  To scale recruiting, VN Sports will partner with A2A Sports Marketing, LLC, founded by Michigan students Seth Sugar, Jordan Morant and Madeleine Calcagno, who will support engaging and qualifying talent to join Viral Nation's talent roster.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristidosh/2021/09/02/viral-nation-enters-nil-market-with-key-student-athlete-and-alumni-signings/,Viral Nation Enters NIL Market With Key Student Athlete And Alumni Signings
"A single principle threads its way through many signs of positive change that promise to transform the forces of production and consumption as we emerge from crisis: Sustainability. Environmental technology concept. Sustainable development goals. SDGs. Environmental and social priorities are re-configuring supply chains everywhere to move production to the point of demand as companies embrace the new realities of the post-pandemic market. And the shifting dynamics of consumer loyalty induced by a revolution in expectations and rapidly changing preferences among customers demand a radical rethink of order fulfillment. Accenture has identified these phenomena in our inaugural Business Futures report among the Signals necessary for leaders and businesses to understand as they reinvent themselves for a new competitive era, and their implications are dramatic.  While the footprint of production and fulfillment was once measured in energy, resources and mileage, new technologies and business models are introducing sweeping efficiencies and minimizing the impact of distance on operations.  By breaking the physical limits of supply chains, companies can do more with less and focus on meeting customers’ growing expectations for fulfillment that is cost-efficient – and sustainable.  Yet despite these positive signs, evidence suggests many businesses still struggle to match their sustainable rhetoric with results, resulting in an “intention-delivery” gap. Supply unbounded The pandemic has both highlighted our impact on the planet and exacerbated longstanding inequities between individuals, industries and countries.  Companies are responding to a sea change in demand for a shift to more sustainable forms of production that exploit the opportunities of new technology – from data analytics and AI to digital twins and quantum logistics. They have learned critically important lessons from the pandemic, which required them to take drastic steps to keep goods moving and ensure customer orders are fulfilled. As a result, businesses are intervening at every stage of the supply chain, moving from centralized, linear models of supply to decentralized networks using on-demand production – a new face of supply chains Accenture calls “Supply Unbounded”. Route-optimization algorithms are cutting mileage and speeding up delivery rates, while cloud-based, quantum computing can calculate optimal routes from millions of real-time data points about traffic congestion.  By “atomizing” supply chains into micro-fulfillment centers, businesses can deliver more orders and serve more customers – without expanding their footprint.  And they can eliminate excess inventory, and hence slash waste, by shipping and producing what they know customers want and reusing what they do not. Essentially decoupling fulfillment from distance and fulfilling more orders with a smaller footprint and less waste.  A few key steps are needed to break the physical limits of supply chains. Businesses need to redefine the purpose of their physical infrastructure and manage inventory more effectively through solutions such as pooling it in port warehouses and pushing out on demand, for example, and using local couriers and on-demand delivery firms. But breaking the limits of supply also requires organizations to look differently at their products, redesigning them to take advantage of circular business models with reuse and re-manufacturing in mind at the outset. Great expectations The pandemic has changed consumer expectations radically, buoying awareness of our impact on the planet and empowering stakeholder demands for companies to be in the vanguard of action.  Restructuring supply chains is one way to meet those expectations and deliver on sustainable commitments – but businesses can also transform their relationship with customers by responding to other key Signals of change. They can change the way they make decisions, for example, by pushing authority to their “edges” where they are best positioned to meet shifting customer loyalties and preferences.  “Edge organizations” have been empowered by the pandemic, which triggered the biggest ever experiment in remote working at scale and greater connectivity. Teams connected by networks are able to decide how to organize, work, meet corporate goals and deliver on the mission while optimizing for local performance, thereby freeing up headquarters to focus on key strategic decisions. As virtual environments enhance our physical worlds and redefine our understanding of place, markets are also creating new ways to consume. The most innovative companies are blending virtual and physical worlds in what Accenture calls “Real Virtualities” which offer opportunities to create new forms of value for customers and improve their interactions with their people. Real Virtualities offer huge potential advances in sustainability. Remote experiences mean less travel, less congestion and lower carbon emissions, and realistic 3D images of virtual prototypes enshrined in “digital twins” can eliminate vast amounts of manufacturing waste. Forward-looking capabilities driven by data, analytics and artificial intelligence create opportunities for organizations to stay ahead of rivals by foreseeing sustainable opportunities and preparing for unexpected risks.  Additionally, the accelerating pace of innovation reflects a new, more profound application of scientific methods to tackle our most fundamental challenges, and the pandemic has placed scientific innovation firmly back at the top of the agenda.  Scientific disruption will enable the creation of better, cheaper, but above all more sustainable, products and services. Start and end with purpose While the Signals of business change that are reshaping organizations globally are diverse, they all have the potential to serve a common objective across industry: a new sense of purpose built upon infusing sustainability throughout their reinvention journeys. Purpose is a new gold standard with which companies and their leaders are being judged by their own workers, stakeholders and consumers – who will pledge loyalty to businesses with values that align with their social concerns. But embedding purpose into the core of a company is also the key to delivery, giving companies a means to assess performance in order to close the “intention-delivery” gap. The challenge they face is to go beyond merely drafting a target-driven purpose statement to embedding it into the core of their operations, so first and foremost it is essential for a business to find its purpose, then commit to it.  While stakeholders have diverse expectations, sustainability offers a way to manage conflicts because it is one commitment they are all likely to share.  But sustainable purpose also makes business sense. In the innovative post-pandemic era embracing sustainability will be the realistic pathway to growth, from circular business models to virtual environments and innovation in the natural sciences.  The financial rewards of seeing sustainability as the common denominator for multiple forms of business change will be significant: Companies that consider the impact of their actions beyond the balance sheet achieve stronger financial performance according our analysis. However, corporate purpose founded on environmental and social priorities goes far beyond shareholder return – it redefines the meaning of value itself. It responds to a growing consensus that the interests of both society and investors are best served by companies that focus on multi-dimensional value creation to benefit all stakeholders. By aligning their purpose with social goals, companies become a vanguard for change.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2021/09/02/multiple-signals-of-change-with-one-sustainable-thread/,Multiple Signals Of Change With One Sustainable Thread
"Leandro Lopes High fashion was an industry that for many decades was difficult to break into for small businesses. Every now and again a new brand would enter the industry but the majority of sales would come from large fashion conglomerates or very famous designers. Over the last ten years, due to the evolution of things such as direct-to-consumer e-commerce and social media we have seen smaller brands gain prominence and go from generating 6-figure revenue to being in major high street retailers. One fashion entrepreneur who is on his way to achieving exactly that is Leandro Lopes, founder of handmade footwear brand Leandro Lopes. Early Beginnings Leandro was born in Portugal to a family that has a long heritage in the footwear industry. Over 50 years ago his grandfather founded a factory for high-quality shoes and classic leather goods working with brands such as Louis Vuitton and Valentino. However, a family tragedy happened when his grandfather unexpectedly passed away which meant they had to close down the factory. Seeking economic refuge his family moved to Germany when he was very young and set up a new life there. Over time some of his family members in Portugal managed to re-open the factory and started manufacturing shoes again and Leandro would spend many of his holidays working in the factory learning about the industry. This exposure to designing and manufacturing high-quality handmade shoes sparked an interest in fashion for Leandro and a desire to one day start his own shoe brand.  Launching Leandro Lopes At 26, after gaining further experience in the industry Leandro decided it was time to pursue his dream and launch his own brand with €10k of startup capital he had saved up. The plan was to create high-quality shoes with the same ethos and care his grandfather used to use but modernize the designs based on his tastes. The logic behind taking this approach rather than manufacturing for other companies or copying other designs was a “desire to create our own direction so we could build long-lasting unique designs where customers could tell the shoes are our brand before they’ve even seen the logo”.  Award winning singer Jason Derulo in Leandro Lopes  After designing their first set of trainers the ‘Vico - Low Top’ Leandro set about marketing and given the limited budget decided to focus on social media. His business partner Mohamad Sharif was fortunate enough to have a few contacts who were close to famous German rappers. These rappers included the brand name in their songs which led to the brand going viral and selling out in a matter of hours. The team re-invested the profits into new designs and over time many other celebrities from athletes such as Floyd Mayweather to musicians such as Jason Derulo have endorsed the brand posting pictures of their trainers citing the quality and design as the type of unique look they go for. This strategy turned the €10k Leandro invested to launch the business into €600k in the space of 6 months and much more since then. The Future Of Leandro Lopes As the company has built up significant credibility as an up-and-coming footwear brand the team has expanded into physical retail, listing their products in over 60 stores. This is a strategy they look to expand both in their core European market but also internationally. Today the team has 40 members of staff creating handcrafted premium trainers as well as select fashion items. A combination of passion, resourceful marketing strategies, and quality product design which Leandro learned from his grandfather has ensured despite a tough upbringing he has been able to carry out the family legacy and with significant plans for future growth in the coming years.

"Days after Hurricane Ida devastated coastal Louisiana and knocked out power to practically the entire southeastern portion of the state, a significant fuel shortage has quickly become one of the most pressing issues, since gasoline-powered generators are now one of the few reliable power sources in the area. Motorists wait in line for gas after Hurricane Ida on Sept. 1, 2021 in Hammond, Louisiana. (Photo by ... [+] Sean Rayford/Getty Images) The few gas stations with fuel in southeast Louisiana in some cases have lines stretching for miles, with the hours-long waits reportedly causing high tensions and fistfights over line-cutting. According to GasBuddy, more than 65% of gas stations in both Louisiana and Baton Rouge were without fuel as of 8 a.m. Central time Thursday, and more than 35% of stations were empty across the state of Louisiana. The lengthy outage after Hurricane Ida swept through the area on Sunday is causing many personal generators to run short on fuel. Power remains out for more than 900,000 customers in Louisiana, according to PowerOutage.US, including nearly 88% of the city of New Orleans. U.S. Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) sent a letter to the heads of the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, saying ""I strongly urge you"" to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide relief for the region. The reserve, created after the oil crisis in the 1970s, is administered by the Energy Department and is the largest emergency petroleum supply in the world. 80%. That's how much of the Gulf of Mexico's oil production remains offline, the Energy Department said in an update on Thursday. Natural gas production has been even more affected, with 83% offline. “We need fuel to be brought in before the refineries come back up on their own because right now we don’t know when that’s going to be,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said on Wednesday. The governor also said he's asking President Joe Biden to take action to relieve the fuel shortage. Biden is set to visit Louisiana on Friday. Louisiana's coastal communities were largely destroyed after Hurricane Ida made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph on Sunday, tying it with two other storms as the most powerful to ever hit Louisiana. An eastward jog by the hurricane after it made landfall also brought some of the worst impacts to New Orleans and its inner suburbs, with the high winds managing to cut off the city from all eight of its outside power sources, including a 400-foot tall transmission tower that crumpled just to the west of New Orleans.

"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 24: U.S. President Joe Biden holds a semiconductor during his remarks ... [+] before signing an Executive Order on the economy in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 24, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images) There has been much commentary about global supply chains not being resilient enough. All the disruptions caused by the pandemic, of course, has contributed to this. One culprit, it is argued, is global supply chains being too lean. Does this mean, companies should abandon lean practices?  No. It is possible to be lean, where it makes sense, and resilient. The operational excellence methodology known as “lean” is centered on preserving value with less work by avoiding waste. Lean speaks of the seven wastes: overproduction, unnecessary transportation, inventory, motion, defects, over processing, and waiting.  Lean practitioners believe that when manufacturers stockpile large quantities of raw materials, load up the shop floor with work-in-process, and pack warehouses with finished goods, that the results are more product defects, long and unpredictable lead times, higher costs, and too much cash tide up as working capital. Lean initially became a popular continuous improvement methodology because of Toyota's emergence as a leader in the automotive industry. Toyota’s success was attributed in large part to their use of lean. The principles of lean were introduced in the book The Machine That Changed the World. The book was published in 1991. Since then, manufacturers around the world have embraced lean. In the automotive industry, Kanban warehouses are common. These warehouses are located in close proximity to an OEM's plant. Tier 1 suppliers are engaged in a collaborative forecasting process with the OEM. They supply inventory to support the next week or two of a plant's production schedule. Inventory is shuttled from the warehouse to the plant on a just-in-time, just-in-sequence basis. This allows the plant to operate in a very lean manner. This practice, known as vendor managed inventory, is an excellent example of lean.  If disruptions to a global supply chain occur, this can result in a company being unable to meet demand. The global semiconductor shortage, that began in the first quarter of this year, has led major carmakers to announce significant rollbacks in their production. It has forced some to tell Wall Street to expect lower revenues. If automakers had foreseen this shortage and stockpiled semiconductor chips, they would be in far better shape. Does this make the vendor managed inventory process obsolete? It does not. It does mean that manufacturers need to understand where inventory needs to be buffered (“fat”) and where it can remain lean. This in turn means that manufacturers need to understand where they are single sourced on key components. In terms of single sourcing, a useful metric is called “revenue at risk.” This metric has a manufacturer do an analysis of how much revenue they would lose if a key component became unavailable for some defined period (a week, a month, or even longer).  When it comes to material availability, companies need to look deeply into their supply base. They can’t just have good knowledge of their Tier 1 suppliers and trust them to manage Tier 2. A single sourced component might become unavailable not because of something that the Tier 1 supplier does, but because they are facing shortages from one of their suppliers. These lessons are being learned. Coupa, a solution provider with a global spend management platform and supply chain design solutions, leverages the data from their platform to publish a quarterly Business Spend Index. In the most recent Index, they report that “on average, companies doubled the number of suppliers they are using in 2021, as compared to pre-pandemic levels. This likely comes as companies make strategic shifts in how they operate to ensure long-term resilience.” But the semiconductor shortage impacting the auto industry shows that achieving resilience is more complex than having multiple suppliers. According to Bindiya Vikal, CEO of Resilinc, the semiconductor shortage was a long time in the making. Two big Japanese semiconductors had fires last year, a labor strike affected facilities in Europe, and container shortages and groundings of 747s made it difficult to move chips to auto plants. Resilinc is one provider of risk monitoring solutions that maps a company’s end-to-end supply chain. This risk solution understands which plants are supplying a manufacturer, how goods flow to a manufacturer’s plant, and whether there are choke points – like a port – that a high proportion of raw materials flow through. The Resilinc solution is one type of supply chain collaboration network (SCCN) solution. Recently published market research shows that this market has been growing rapidly. In part, this is because some SCCN solutions can provide the kind of robust upstream visibility manufacturers need. When the type of analysis provided by SCCN risk solutions is combined with supply chain design tools, like the solution offered by Coupa, companies can understand where inventory buffers need to be located and how much inventory it makes sense to hold at these buffer sites.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2021/09/02/can-manufacturers-be-both-lean-and-resilient/,Can Manufacturers Be Both Lean And Resilient?
"Vella Bioscience Vella women's pleasure serum  After years of scientific research, Vella Bioscience has introduced a revolutionary pleasure serum that promises to increase the frequency, intensity and satisfaction of a woman’s orgasm.  Developed by a medical team, including Dr. Harin Padma-Nathan, the lead principal investigator for Viagra and Cialis, Vella works locally to relax the smooth muscle tissue and increase blood flow to enhance sexual arousal and orgasm in cis women.  Dr. Padma-Nathan is quick to say Vella is not Viagra for women, but from a layman’s – or more accurately, a laywoman’s – perspective, it sounds a lot like it.  “Viagra for men is very different. Viagra is a prescription medication that works systemically to treat erectile dysfunction,” he explains. “Vella is applied locally and doesn’t treat sexual dysfunction. Rather it works to enhance sexual pleasure from the potential that is already there.” Unlike menthol-based drugstore topicals, which can irritate, or lubricants that only lubricate, Vella delivers a carefully-regulated dose of cannabidiol (CBD) through a nano-encapsulated serum that penetrates the delicate tissue in a way the topical application of oil can’t. “Ours is a simple serum that’s applied 20 minutes or so ahead, though in some cases it works as quickly as five minutes,” Dr. Padma-Nathan explains. “There’s no systemic or total body exposure, which may have undesirable side-effects. You use it when you want to and then it goes away in a couple of hours.” Rather than taking a pharmaceutical approach, as a comparable Viagra for women would, Vella aims at the rapidly growing sexual wellness market.  “We wanted to give half the world’s population – women – equity in sexual fulfillment in a manner that is safe and effective,” Dr. Padma-Nathan continues. “We are focused on augmenting a woman’s normal function or recuperating a lot of that function if lost, as in post-menopausal women. And in our studies we found two out of three women overall will respond.” A second women’s sexual revolution is happening now, the first being the introduction of birth control pills in the 1960s. Many women would say it’s about time.  “Biologically, women were never required to feel pleasure to procreate, unlike men who have to climax to make a baby,” shares Bulbul Hooda, chief marketing officer at Vella Bioscience. “Then there is the complexity of female anatomy and the hormonal spectrum a woman goes through as she ages, monthly at one end and perimenopause and menopause at the other. As a result, women were underserved and never a top-of-mind priority. But it’s finally arrived in 2021. If not now, when?” Arrived it has, as the the sexual wellness market catches fire. “The sexual wellness boom started even before the pandemic, but we saw it gain momentum with it,” she says. “Traditionally, women’s sexual wellness products were hidden in the nightstand like a dirty secret. We want to normalize female pleasure as self-affirming and remove the stigma around sex so a woman can celebrate sexual positivity.” While the estimates of the size of the sexual wellness market vary widely, it is gaining a lot of investor interest, most notably the $1.2 billion merger of Lovehoney with WOW Tech Group. Specializing in sex toys, the new company, called The Lovehoney Group, expects to generate more than $400 million this year to become the world’s largest sexual wellness company by revenue.  And because many sexual wellness companies are at the early stage of growth, there has been over 100 U.S. deals this year in “femtech” totaling some $812 million in value, Glossy reports.  With women now demanding equal time in the pleasure department, established retailers are scrambling to find ways to serve her. Bloomingdale’s, for example, has opened a “Sexual Wellness” shop online, offering “body-positive, female-led” brands as the “ultimate in self-love essentials,” with an emphasis sex toys.  Vella Bioscience is taking a different route, positioning its pleasure serum with prestige beauty brands, rather than in the small appliance department. “Sexual wellness is the next frontier of beauty,” Hooda says. “In beauty we say we sell hope in a jar, but more than hope, Vella actually makes a difference in your physical health, emotional health and your mental wellbeing.” Having worked 15 years in the beauty industry, for such brands as Shiseido, Unilever and L’Oreal, Hooda has applied her prestige beauty experience into launching the product into the category.  Vella’s packaging is designed to look like prestige beauty and sit alongside a woman’s beauty products and on a retailer’s beauty counter.  Priced at $65 for 16 carefully-regulated doses, it is pricey but its research-based technology justifies the price tag. However, it is also available in a single-use packet for $8 and this holiday the company is releasing a gift-boxed skew for $30 with five applications.  In May it was introduced on the company’s direct-to-consumer website and quickly gained interest from retailers. Bergdorf Goodman’s trend-spotter and creative director Linda Fargo was one of the first to bring it into the store. Also taking the in-store plunge is multi-brand luxury beauty retailer Cos Bar. It is now carried in five of its 19 stores, though it is planning to add two more locations soon. Cos Bar was founded in 1976 and is renown for leading with beauty innovations.  Other luxury retailers, including Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom

 , offer Vella online, but not yet in store.  “Every retailer we spoke to said they want to bring it into the store, but they don’t know exactly how to do it,” she explains. “It could make for awkward conversations, since women don’t generally walk into the store and ask if they have anything for orgasms. But as we’ve worked with sales staff, they are getting comfortable talking about sex. It won’t be long now.” Vella fills a void in the sexual wellness market that sex toys can’t, though it can be used with them. It’s for women at every life stage with the company finding women on both ends of the age spectrum – young adult women discovering their bodies and mature Baby Boomers – showing strong interest in the product.  “Legacy beauty brands and retailers are losing customers who are exploring new brands, emerging beauty philosophies and alternative ways to shop. We expect other retailers to join us as women of all ages seek out sexual wellness after spending a lifetime not able to realize the full volume of her pleasure,” Hooda relates.  “The fear of labels and sex-shaming have prevented us women from maximizing our sexual agency and embracing a culture where female pleasure is a priority. It is about time that changed. With Vella, the pleasure is ours,” she concludes.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/09/02/womens-viagra-like-sex-serum-coming-to-neiman-marcus-bergdorf-goodman-saks-and-nordstrom/,"Women’s Viagra-Like Sex Serum Coming To Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks And Nordstrom"
"Torrential rainfall, heavy flooding and furious winds, including tornadoes, hit the east coast from New York to Maryland on Wednesday night, resulting in at least 17 deaths and forcing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a state of emergency in the city as the remnants of Hurricane Ida tore through the area. A person makes their way in rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Ida on September 1, 2021, in the ... [+] Bronx borough of New York City. In New York City, nine people are known to have died in the storm, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a press conference late Thursday morning. Flooding killed six people in New Jersey, NBC News reported. A man in Maryland man died when his building was flooded, NPR News reported, and a woman in Pennsylvania, where tornadoes were recorded, was killed when a tree fell onto a home. The New York Police Department did not name any of the city’s victims but said they were found in four different scenes and were aged between 2 and 66-years-old, the New York Times reported. “President Biden called [and] offered any assistance that the state of New York needs,” including approving emergency declarations to free up money for recovery, said Kathy Hochul, the state’s new governor, at the press conference Thursday morning. “I told him we’ll take him up on that,” she said.  3.15 inches. That’s the amount of rain that was recorded between 8:51 pm and 9:51 pm in New York’s Central Park, the highest ever recorded in the area over a single hour. According to NBC News, this is the total amount of rainfall that Chicago usually records in a month. The severe weather conditions also managed to delay a U.S. Open tennis match inside the roofed Louis Armstrong Stadium as strong wind gusts blew the rain sideways into the stadium. The severe weather conditions have left close to 240,000 homes in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut without power early on Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us. Earlier this week, devastation from Ida had left over a million households in Louisiana without power, and as of 3 a.m. E.T. on Thursday more than 930,000 homes in the southern state are still under a blackout. Despite Ida growing weaker as it moved inland from the Gulf Coast—where it had hit Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on Sunday—the tropical storm brought torrential rainfall to states further north, prompting flood warnings. The National Weather Service (NWS) declared a flash flood emergency until late Wednesday night for more than 9 million people in the New York City area. De Blasio, Hochul and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared states of emergency Wednesday night, urging residents to stay inside and avoid travel, while New Jersey’s main airport, in Newark, halted all flights due to “severe flooding.” Ida’s wind-driven remnants pummel the New York City region (New York Times) Flash floods from Ida swamp NYC, shut down subway system as meteorologists warn, ‘Seek higher ground now!’ (New York Daily News)",https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/09/02/at-least-17-dead-in-new-york-and-along-east-coast-after-heavy-rains-flash-floods-and-tornadoes/,"At Least 17 Dead In New York And Along East Coast After Heavy Rains, Flash Floods And Tornadoes"
"Lionsgate is not on the hook for Moonfall’s $140 million budget, as they have domestic distribution rights with AGC International handling overseas. Nonetheless, it’s as unusual to see any studio, let alone Lionsgate, launching a mega-budget fantasy flick in early 2022 as it was to see them try to open Gods of Egypt in early 2016. That film got caught up in an online controversy over casting mostly white folks (Gerard Butler, Geoffrey Rush, etc.) as theoretical ancient Egyptians. The bonkers-bananas fantasy wasn’t really about ancient Egypt and really should have just been called “Gods of Jupiter.”.  I enjoy that Alex Proyas flick more than most, but the controversy was the least of its problems as a “new” mega-budget flick in a time when the likes of Deadpool and Zoolander, No. 2 got all the press. Roland Emmerich’s Moonfall is a more conventional play, not least of which because it A) has a marquee director doing that which he is most well-known and B) it has something resembling movie stars in the form of Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, Michael Peña and Donald Sutherland. As you might guess from the title, the moon is spiraling toward Earth, and only three plucky NASA employees (Berry, Wilson and John Bradley) can save us.  The announcement teaser gets the job done, showing plenty of outer-space chaos, Earth-specific disaster porn and just a hint at 1.21 that there are aliens (?) on or around the moon. As a fan of most of Emmerich’s disaster flicks, including 2012, I’m obviously on board with this. The question is whether anyone else will be. It’s an original concept, meant to at least implicitly play on nostalgia for Independence Day, which even a sequel to Independence Day couldn’t quite do ($103 million domestic and $390 million on a $165 million budget in summer 2016). Still, 2012 earned $791 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful original live-action flicks ever.  It also earned “only” $166 million domestic, making it the lowest domestic total for a Hollywood flick that still topped $700 million worldwide. But as tempting as it may be to bank on an overseas rescue, that was in doubt before Covid and certainly is an coin toss now. China may just shrug and wait for The Wandering Earth 2 instead. Still, again, Lionsgate is only on the hook for domestic business, and they’ve had a knack over the last decade for launching original theatrical franchises (Expendables, Knives Out, Wonder, Now You See Me, The Hitman’s Bodyguard and, of course, John Wick).  Still, those films didn’t cost $140 million to produce. Come what may, Moonfall could be my wife’s favorite movie of 2022 and one of her favorite movie since Dean Devlin’s Geostorm ($33 million domestic but $221 million worldwide on a $120 million budget). Yes, she likes non-elevated horror and elevated disaster movies, so you can imagine she still pines for the Final Destination series. Moonfall opens February 4, 2022, in IMAX no less, where it will face off against the just-delayed Jackass Forever. It’ll open one week after Morbius and The Black Phone and one week before Marry Me and Death on the Nile.

"The first five quarters since Raytheon and United Technologies

  merged in April of 2020 haven’t worked out quite the way management originally envisioned, but they nonetheless have vindicated the strategy underpinning the transaction. That strategy, simply stated, was that the company’s best chance of dominating global aerospace was to be a major player in all addressable markets—commercial and military, domestic and international, original equipment and aftermarket. RTX now has the market footprint it was seeking, but nobody saw coronavirus coming, so commercial business lines expected to drive growth during the early years faltered, while military business bulked larger than anticipated in the mix. Conditions will shift as the global pandemic fades, with commercial demand reverting to steady growth and military demand likely growing at a slower pace. An artist's rendering of the Air Force's secret B-21 bomber. Various Raytheon units will provide ... [+] engines, avionics and weapons for the bomber.  There may be a surprise upside in the defense business, for example if Republicans take control of Congress in midterm elections, but most of the growth through 2024 will be on the commercial side, both in supplying new equipment and in maintaining equipment already in operational fleets. The company’s commercial avionics and engine business is so broadly based that any uptick in global economic activity will likely be beneficial to Raytheon. One outcome that has gotten little attention but looms as a real possibility later in the decade is that Raytheon could emerge as the nation’s leading aerospace firm. At the moment, three companies can aspire to that status on the basis of revenues: Boeing

 , Lockheed

  VALU 
  figures that Boeing could generate $74.7 billion in sales this year, while Lockheed is projecting $68-69 billion and Raytheon is projecting $64-65 billion. However, in future years Raytheon Technologies has much greater growth potential than Lockheed by virtue of its sprawling commercial business. Boeing’s prospects are clouded by recent setbacks in both its commercial and military units—the kind of setbacks that take years to recover from in a long-cycle business. For instance, Boeing lost the competition to build a new Air Force bomber, and has not fared well in its competition with SpaceX to provide transportation to the International Space Station. Raytheon’s federal business lines are less vulnerable to such setbacks because they are scattered across literally thousands of programs, only a handful of which are material to the company’s bottom line. In the cases where a defense program bulks large, like the engine for the F-35 fighter and B-21 bomber, Raytheon is the sole source of an essential product. Boeing retains a huge backlog of $285 billion in orders for commercial transports, and the 737 MAX comprising the preponderance of those orders is faring well in its return to service, but the company’s commercial products are beset by issues with regulators that may impede its ability to fully exploit demand. So both on the defense side and on the commercial side, Boeing faces uncertainties that Raytheon does not. Value Line estimates that Boeing revenues will reach $100 billion in 2024-2026, while Raytheon revenues will be nearly $90 billion and Lockheed Martin will be $81.5 billion. But Value Line also projects that in that timeframe Raytheon Technologies will be generating 20% operating margins compared to 16% for Lockheed and 9.5% for Boeing. One reason Boeing might generate lower margins is that a significant share of the revenues on its aircraft is passed through to subcontractors and suppliers—including Raytheon’s Collins Aerospace unit. Collins is a leading, if not the leading, supplier of onboard systems for commercial transports—from flight controls to communications to displays to navigation aids to power generators to fuel management systems. It even supplies seating and lighting for jetliners. So when Boeing or rival Airbus deliver an aircraft, much of the content actually comes from Raytheon. And that’s before we even get to the engines, many of which are supplied by Raytheon’s Pratt & Whitney unit. Pratt’s geared turbofan engines are gradually transforming the propulsion market for single-aisle jetliners, due to an intrinsic technological advantage in fuel efficiency. To the extent that the Airbus edge in orders for single-aisle aircraft persists—it currently holds 65% of backlog—Pratt’s products are likely to be a big beneficiary. The geared turbofan is one of two propulsion options available on the Airbus A320neo family, and also is offered on the A220 jetliner (Boeing relies exclusively on General Electric engines for its 737). Operators have been quick to return jetliners equipped with geared turbofans to service as the global pandemic eases. None of this necessarily guarantees that Raytheon Technologies will catch up with Boeing in revenues once the marketplace reverts back to what once was called “normal.” However, it is clear that given the present portfolios of the three domestic aerospace leaders, Raytheon has options going forward that Lockheed Martin does not, while it faces few of the market challenges Boeing must deal with. So it is quite possible that when the smoke clears from Covid-19, Raytheon will have emerged as the biggest aerospace and defense enterprise in America. In one sense that is not so surprising. On the commercial side, it is heir to the aerospace acumen of Hamilton, Goodrich, Pratt, Rockwell Collins and Sunstrand. On the military side, it is the bearer of expertise accumulated by such renowned companies as Hughes Aircraft, Pratt, Texas Instruments

"As Melinda Gates once told Forbes, empowered women change societies. And while women are already making a comeback following the she-cession, we’ve still got work to do when it comes to how women are portrayed and targeted in marketing.  In fact, recent research shows that only 37% of Americans believe women are accurately represented in advertising (that number is even smaller amongst women—dropping to 29%).  Why is this important? Because representation matters—and marketing is one of today’s biggest communication vehicles and seen as a mirror of our society. So if a marketing plan isn’t accurately representing the community it’s trying to serve, it could hinder progress on top of wasting a company’s ad dollars.  Of course, we are encouraged by the many brands that are committed to change and creating a more equitable society. And to help these dedicated companies, we’ve identified five upgrades you can make to your marketing strategy. From fueling belonging to challenging taboos, use these insights to help your brand connect with and empower female customers.   Five female colleagues at a work meeting smiling to camera Want women to align and champion your brand? Invite them in. By fostering a community and building trust, your audience’s loyalty will grow. It’s why companies like Chief have seen such success in bringing women together and why research from Deloitte encourages brands to create more high-trust and inclusive cultures moving forward. It’s also why 38% of moms are more likely to purchase from brands “liked” by other women and why Whitney Wolfe Herd has had so much success by empowering women to make the first move. Community and trust breed life-long customers. Or, as ForbesWomen contributor, Stephanie Burns, puts it, “Trust is the most powerful component to any form of marketing or business transaction.” Inclusivity doesn’t mean just marketing to women, and marketing to women doesn’t just mean marketing to one type of woman. Effective marketing is about embracing all of those who identify as women. After all, female-identifying individuals come from all backgrounds, all ages, and all sizes. The days of a one-dimensional portrayal of women in marketing are over. If you genuinely want to reach more women, it’s critical to be mindful of the whole female experience, even on sensitive topics. Sure, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, but it is your responsibility as a brand to be as inclusive as possible and fuel belonging.  While this insight may seem obvious, we’ve seen many cases in advertising where this didn’t happen. It’s also one of the reasons that Ruth Bernstein, cofounder and CEO of YARD NYC, created an agency to challenge the norm in the advertising industry. Bernstein said, “agencies at the time were a real boys club, very dominated by men at all levels,” and she, along with her husband, set out to bring more women into the room. The lesson: if you want to reach women, make sure they’re in the room with you brainstorming. Marketing has been known to shy away from female topics like periods, aging, menopause, breastfeeding—the list goes on. Take it from Sally Mueller and Michelle Jacobs, the founders of Womaness, a company taking on once secretive and embarrassing topics and focusing on the total wellbeing of women. To help challenge and normalize taboos, they suggest brands try methods like “focusing on the positive and avoiding the awkward” and “offering a safe and welcoming community.” In the meantime, many female entrepreneurs are challenging these taboos as we speak—from booby tape to breast pumps to period products—and breaking the glass ceiling as they go. Unless your brand gets on board, you’ll miss marketing to a new generation of women moving past stigmas. Between 2007 and 2019, women started businesses at 5x the national average, and women-owned businesses generated $1.6 trillion in revenue every year. We know that many women were forced out of the workforce during the global pandemic. Yet many women found a way to overcome the odds by starting their own company or growing their existing empires, as seen by this year’s America's Richest Self-Made Women’s List. One explanation for this growth comes from Bethany Frankel, a self-made businesswoman herself, who told Forbes’ Moira Forbes that “a downturn is the ideal time to launch a new business.” Today’s female consumers have more power than ever. But to continue helping women move forward, marketers must work together to accurately and fairly represent female customers in advertising and marketing. To second Moira Forbes, “power is parity.” So, we leave you with this, is your marketing strategy empowering women? And if not, what’s stopping you?

"A Russian combat robot is breaking new ground in autonomy, patrolling without human assistance, navigating its way across a 100-kilomter route and working with a swarm of drones. The new demonstrations, which were announced by the State-owned RIA Novosti news service last week, may look like me-too achievements in terms of competing with the West. Unlike the U.S. though, Russia puts its robots into the field, and the technology is likely to be used sooner rather than later. The Marker unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is being developed by Russia’s equivalent of DARPA, the Foundation for Advanced Studies (FPI). It is armed with a 7.62mm machine gun and a pair of guided anti-tank missiles, and has been involved in several development projects.  The Marker combat robot — note the small drones which can be used for reconnaissance and target ... [+] finding. “The Marker concept is a technology demonstrator, to see what technologies and systems can work, and to experiment with different approaches to building a functional UGV,”  Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russian unmanned systems, and adviser to both the CNA and CNAS told Forbes.  According to the report, the tests were carried out in the Chelyabinsk region with two wheeled vehicles and one tracked. The longest journey was 100 kilometers which took over five hours, including on-road and off-road elements. The operator only needed to select the start and end points; the robot found its own route, creating a map as it went using cameras and other sensors. It automatically avoided obstacles while sticking to the fastest route. This is part of a plan of autonomous travel for Marker which started in 2019 and which ultimately aims to include 200-km trips. It some ways it is a replica of DARPA’s own 2005 Grand Challenge which saw autonomous vehicles competing to finish a 210 km route following similar rules. The report also described tests of the Marker’s ability to autonomously patrol a given area. In separate demonstrations, the marker was teamed with a swarm of drones. In a 2019 video, Marker was shown working with a group of fifteen drones which worked together in three teams of five. These provided long-range scouting capability, allowing the Marker to see into inaccessible places, especially in an urban environment. They can also pass on target data for the Marker to engage targets which it cannot see directly – similar to the EU’s Beyond Line of Sight project which demonstrated anti-tank missiles directed by small drones. In the new demonstration, the Market itself acts as a drone carrier, and presumably communications relay for the drones. The motive for having so many is not just to provide a wide coverage, but also to field swarms of the kamikaze attack drones or loitering munitions which Russia is starting to field. “The Marker will at some point be tested with combat drones and loitering munitions as well,” says Bendett, noting that Russia has previously experimented with teaming other robotic vehicles with drones. The idea may be gaining traction there. Bendett notes that Marker is a modular system, so different contractors can offer new technology which is simply be plugged in and tested. This allows new ideas and technologies to be fats-tracked into the testing process.  “The Russian MoD is considering the development and integration of autonomous and robotic systems in its military force. This will be a methodical process that will try to address the main technological issues with such an integration,” says Bendett. “There is a formation of a 20-strong Uran-9 UGV unit so that the MOD would learn the use of such technology in combat and as part of an integrated force.“ The autonomy solutions developed for the Market would be shared across a number of robot platforms, including the Uran-9, Shturm, Soratnik and possibly the uncrewed version of the T-14 Armata battle tank. A key difference between Russia and the U.S. is what although America has been developing armed ground robots for some 40 years, there have always been objections to actually fielding them. The Air Force routinely fly drone strike missions, but ground robots like MAARS seem to be marooned in development hell.  (There have been hints of covert U.S. use of such robots but nothing official).  By contrast, Russia fielded armed Uran-9 robots in Syria: they performed badly, but the Russian learned from the experience, and we can expect the new technology to go the same way.  “We would also probably see such UGV tests conducted in Syria at some point,” says Bendett. “Uran-9 failures there in 2018 taught the designers important lessons that were supposedly incorporated into Uran-9 modifications. Such tech would then be tested in real or ‘near’ combat conditions.” Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu recently boasted that his military had tested over 320 types of weapon in Syria. Their autonomous ground robots may be in Chelyabinsk, but they will be on the battlefield tomorrow – and there will be an improved version as a result the next day. It seems Russia is gambling on aggressive development in very literal fashion in its goal of fielding a robotic Red Army.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/09/02/russias-autonomous-robot-tank-passes-new-milestone-and-launches-drone-swarm/,Russia’s Autonomous Robot Tank Passes New Milestone (And Launches Drone Swarm)
"While not able to prevent all coronavirus infections, Covid-19 vaccines drastically cut the odds of severe illness and hospitalization in rare breakthrough cases, according to a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal Wednesday, underscoring the benefits of vaccination as hospitals across the country struggle to cope with surges of mostly unvaccinated patients.  Vaccines provide high levels of protection against hospitalization and serious illness caused by ... [+] Covid-19.  One or two doses of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines reduced the chances of hospitalization by around 70%, according to a peer-reviewed analysis of data from roughly 2 million fully or partially vaccinated people in the U.K. Vaccination also contributed towards roughly 30% lower odds for severe illness, counted as having five or more symptoms in the first week of illness, with fully immunized individuals having slightly lower odds.      Breakthrough infections were almost twice as likely to be asymptomatic in the fully vaccinated, the researchers found, and these patients were half as likely to develop long Covid, the debilitating, lingering illness that can persist for months or years after infection. Among the rare Covid-19 cases reported in those getting a shot—fewer than 0.5% of the partially vaccinated and 0.2% of the fully vaccinated in the study did—symptoms were almost always less severe, except for sneezing, which the researchers noted was more common among the partially vaccinated.      The researchers also found a possible link between age and breakthrough infections, especially among frail adults over the age of 60, who were almost two times as likely to contract Covid-19 after one vaccine dose than healthy older adults.  People living in deprived areas were also more likely to experience breakthrough infections—mostly after the first dose—though the researchers warned this could be explained by other reasons like living conditions and lower levels of vaccine uptake in the community.        While vaccines are known to offer protection against Covid-19 after just one dose, the exact nature of this shield in those that do become infected has not been fully elucidated. The researchers describe this study as the “first to investigate” the characteristics of a Covid-19 infection after the first and second shots. The findings offer an insight into why, despite sky high coronavirus levels in the U.S., almost all patients ending up in hospital or dying from the disease are unvaccinated and offers more proof that vaccines are the best protection against Covid-19 even if they are less effective against the delta variant. That older individuals are seemingly at greater risk of breakthrough infections will likely buoy calls for booster shots in wealthy countries. The U.S. plans to provide them from September, a decision that has been criticized by health organizations as unfair and possibly prolonging the pandemic as many countries have hardly administered any vaccines at all.  There were several limitations to the study. As it was conducted between 8 December 2020 through July 4 2021, it covers several different phases of dominant coronavirus variants in the U.K. (notably the rise, and subsequent fall, of alpha and the delta variant). This makes it harder to draw firm conclusions and findings may not apply to places with other variant mixes, the researchers noted. The U.K. 's vaccination schedule—which featured a much longer gap between doses than used in many countries, including the U.S.—could also limit the applicability of the findings elsewhere, the researchers added. Finally, being based on self-reported data from the Zoe Covid study, it’s possible records for some symptoms, vaccination status, test results and other health conditions are inaccurate, though the researchers said the study design has allowed a “good characterisation of infections.” Risk factors and disease profile of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app: a prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study (Lancet) Delta Variant More Than Doubles Risk Of Covid Hospitalization, U.K. Study Finds (Forbes) Vaccine Protection Wanes Within Six Months Of Second Covid Shot, Study Warns, But They’re Still Effective Against Delta (Forbes) Breakthrough Covid Cases: Uncommon and Often Mild, but Not Always (NYT) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/09/02/vaccines-slash-risk-of-long-covid-from-breakthrough-infections-study-finds/,"Vaccines Slash Risk Of Long Covid From Breakthrough Infections, Study Finds"
"The Walking Dead The Walking Dead has just unveiled its final season over the past two weeks in a two-part premiere for season 11. Though “final season” is a bit questionable, as even with the base show ending, AMC is committed to The Walking Dead as a “universe” where it will live on through spin-offs, movies and other projects, even once the comic source material is exhausted. Though I thought the first two episodes were good, what I was not expecting to see was how popular the show currently is after all this time. No, not in terms of old-school ratings, which are hovering around where they were at the end of last season, but in terms of new ways of measuring audience interest. My go-to for this data is always Parrot Analytics, which measures overall “demand” for shows, and is usually showing off whatever Disney or Marvel show is surging in popularity at the moment. But now, with only What If…? airing on Disney Plus, The Walking Dead has risen to become the most in-demand show in the world right now, based on Parrot metrics. The Walking Dead The current list has The Walking Dead at 75x more popular than the average show Parrot measures, ahead of the likes of Game of Thrones, WandaVision, Loki, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Stranger Things, all hovering between 50-70x. This is not all time, this is just in the past week, and yes, that means people are watching those older shows far past when they aired, so part of this may mean that no, there really is not another new show out there right now surging in popularity like The Walking Dead’s recent premiere. “The Walking Dead's overall Pulse is about as strong as any show could be,” the analysis concludes. This is why it’s not all that surprising that The Walking Dead will live on, even after this supersized season 11 is over. So far, the projects we know about are:   And those are only the ones we know about. AMC remains wholly committed to making this franchise live forever, even if the main series is about to sunset.

"WWE could be going big with WrestleMania 38 in 2022. (Brandon Wade/AP Images for WWE) WWE is reportedly sticking with its two-night format for WrestleMania 38. According to Fightful Select (h/t SEScoops), the current “working plan” for WWE’s flagship pay-per-view is to air pro wrestling’s equivalent of the Super Bowl across the course of two nights: “After the reception of the last two years of WrestleMania being split up into two nights, Fightful has learned the working plan internally as of last week was for WrestleMania 38 in Arlington, Texas to also be split up into two nights. The shows are scheduled for Saturday, April 2, and Sunday, April 3.” WWE is returning to AT&T Stadium for WrestleMania 38 just six years after hosting WrestleMania 32 there in a record-setting event, one that packed in more than 101,000 fans for a one-night show. For most of its nearly 40-year existence, WrestleMania has been a lengthy one night event that features blockbuster matches and special superstar appearances, but for the past two years, differing circumstances have caused WWE to expand the event to two nights. In 2020, WWE decided to utilize a two-night Saturday/Sunday format when the Covid-19 pandemic forced the company to host the event inside its own fan-less Performance Center. Earlier this year, WWE followed suit when its first fan-filled pay-per- view event in more than a year, WrestleMania 37, emanated from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. As a result of Covid-related restrictions, WWE had roughly 40,000 total fans attend the shows held over the course of two nights last April. WWE’s decision to split its marquee event was warmly received by its passionate fan base, which in recent years had become disgruntled with lengthy one-night events that felt like more like a marathon than anything else. It had become custom for WrestleMania, including the pre-show, to run more than six hours and feature 15-plus matches, which negatively affected the quality of the show as the crowd began to grow tired of—or flatout hijack—matches that took place later in the night, most notably doing so with Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 34. Even WWE superstar AJ Styles expressed his belief that WWE should either limit the number of matches on the WrestleMania card or expand the show to two nights. Here’s what he told Newsweek in April 2020: “There are a lot of matches in one night, too many if you ask me. Either we cut down on the matches or have two nights. Either way is fine with me. At the end of the day, it's up to the fans and whether they are willing to show up. And at the same time, maybe give someone a chance who can't afford two days they can see one day or pick the night and the matches they want to see.” Styles echoed the sentiment of a lot of WWE fans, who have become increasingly frustrated with WWE’s seemingly never-ending WrestleMania events. The main show for WrestleMania 35 in 2019, for example, lasted five hours and 21 minutes, but less than half of the show featured actual wrestling, with the rest of the show consisting of video packages, entrances, special musical performances, etc. As WWE’s roster has expanded considerably over the past decade even despite its frequent mass releases, there are certainly substantial benefits to WrestleMania being a two-night show, the main being that it results in better crowd reactions and allows WWE to create more matches that have a big fight feel.  Now that WrestleMania taking place across two nights has become a trend over the past two years, fans are growing more accustomed to it, and that’s a good thing—because six-plus hour shows simply weren’t working.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2021/09/02/wwe-reportedly-making-wrestlemania-38-a-two-night-event/,WWE Reportedly Making WrestleMania 38 A Two-Night Event
"After more than a year of legal battles, the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the state to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on Richmond’s Monument Avenue that has been widely criticized as a symbol of racial injustice.  RICHMOND, VA - FEBRUARY 08: The Robert E. Lee Monument stands on Monument Avenue, February 8, 2019 ... [+] in Richmond, Virginia. Virginia state politics are in a state of upheaval, with Governor Ralph Northam, State Attorney General Mark Herring, both Democrats, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment involved with past uses associations with blackface and Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, a Democrat, accused of sexual misconduct by two women. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The state Supreme Court sided with the state in response to two lawsuits from residents trying to block the statue’s removal, and dissolved all injunctions previously imposed by a lower court.  The plaintiffs argued that neither Gov. Ralph Northam (D) nor the state’s General Assembly had the power to revoke an agreement that placed the statue on Monument Avenue in 1899.  Meanwhile, lawyers for the state of Virginia argued “you cannot force the Commonwealth to maintain in perpetuity a statue that communicates a racist message,” as outlined by Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) during oral arguments in this case in June.  The court sided with the state’s argument, arguing the “restrictive covenants” of the deeds “are unenforceable as contrary to public policy” and “their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees.”  “We have won the case,” wrote Attorney General Herring on Twitter. “The Supreme Court of Virginia has dissolved all injunctions and the statue may now come down. A big win for a more inclusive Commonwealth!”  The statue, which is the largest and the last Confederate monument on Monument Avenue, has been targeted with calls for removal for years, including in the aftermath of the deadly Unite the Right rally in August 2017. But it was only after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the ensuing racial justice protests that Gov. Northam announced the Richmond statue would be taken down. Northam’s announcement sparked a flurry of legal challenges, rulings and injunctions that held up its removal for more than a year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/02/virginia-supreme-court-green-lights-removal-of-richmonds-robert-e-lee-statue-after-lengthy-legal-battle/,Virginia Supreme Court Green-Lights Removal Of Richmond’s Robert E.

"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 12: Singer Halsey attends The 59th GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Center on ... [+] February 12, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS) Next week, Kanye West will almost certainly debut his new album Donda at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, earning his milestone tenth leader (as a soloist) in the process. The rapper’s set is expected to start with more than 300,000 equivalent units, which will easily make it the biggest title in the country, beating another project that was previously thought to be in the running for the throne. Until Donda appeared on streaming services, Halsey was all but assured the No. 1 space on the Billboard 200. The singer-songwriter’s new album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power is expected to move around 100,000 equivalent units, which would have been enough to arrive in first place, but sadly it can’t compete with West’s latest.  Next week will mark the second time in Halsey’s career that they have been seemingly on track to debut a new album at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, only to lose out on the space as a massively popular rapper drops a somewhat unexpected title just in time to best the pop musician. In early 2020, Halsey’s Manic was predicted by many to become their second No. 1 on the Billboard 200, as they had announced it weeks in advance and promoted it with quite a few singles. As the set dropped, Eminem appeared out of nowhere with his latest full-length Music to be Murdered By, which arrived with absolutely no warning. The title bolted right to the summit, launching atop the tally with 279,000 equivalent units, outpacing Halsey’s 239,000 equivalent units, which should have been enough to bring the Grammy-nominated star back to the peak spot for a second time. So far, Halsey has reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 just once, as their sophomore album Hopeless Fountain Kingdom debuted in first place. Their first full-length, Badlands, also stalled one rung shy of running the show. Halsey shocked her fans and the music industry several weeks ago when they revealed that If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power existed, was ready for audiences to hear and would be arriving shortly. The musician didn’t promote it in typical fashion with several singles and music videos, instead opting to deliver the full project all at once. Now, it’s aiming for a No. 2 start on the Billboard 200, and while that may be disappointing to the star and the millions who support them, it doesn’t detract from the praise the title has been receiving from critics the world over. West’s scooping Halsey was not supposed to happen, as the rapper promised the album would arrive many times before it actually hit streaming sites. The set was first talked about last year, and the hip-hop powerhouse and his team shared many dates throughout the summer of 2021, which all came and went without any music. Donda was expected this past Friday, August 27, but it didn’t actually drop until several days later. Most musicians wouldn’t be able to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with a mid-week release, but West is immensely popular, and his latest is one of the most talked about titles of the year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2021/09/02/for-the-second-time-halsey-will-miss-hitting-no-1-because-of-a-surprise-release/,"For The Second Time, Halsey Will Miss Hitting No. 1 Because Of A Surprise Release"
"Stefanos Tsitsipas, of Greece, talks to the crowd after defeating Adrian Mannarino, of France, ... [+] during the second round of the US Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Boos rained down on Stefanos Tsitsipas after he returned to the Arthur Ashe Stadium court following yet another lengthy toilet break at the U.S. Open on Wednesday night. The Greek tennis star heard the jeers after a break that exceeded seven minutes in between the third and fourth sets of his second-round victory over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino.  But Tsitsipas was undaunted by the crowd reaction — or by the shade he got from Andy Murray after taking breaks while beating him on Monday.  Tsitsipas maintains he’s not breaking any rules — and for now he’s right. The Grand Slam rulebook simply states players should take a ""reasonable'' amount of time but does not provide an exact number of minutes that would be acceptable. “If I break a rule, sure, I'm guilty. I agree; I'm not doing something right,” Tsitsipas said after hitting 27 aces and beating Mannarino 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-0 with the roof closed at Arthur Ashe Stadium because of heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. “If I'm staying within the guidelines, then what's the issue?'” Stefanos Tsitsipas, of Greece, waves to the crowd after defeating Adrian Mannarino, of France, ... [+] during the second round of the US Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Against Mannarino, Tsitsipas took a toilet break that created an eight-minute delay after the third set and stirred boos from the crowd. Murray, the three-time major champion, called the Greek’s antics “nonsense” on Monday. Murray also said he ""lost respect"" for Tsitsipas, who is seeded No. 3 at Flushing Meadows and was the runner-up at the French Open in June. Murray later took a swipe at Tsitsipas on Twitter. Tsitsipas said he and Murray need to “both discuss” the issue. Tsitsipas said he needs the breaks to get lighter by changing his clothes.  “It is important,” Tsitsipas said. “First of all, you carry less weight on you with all the sweat. You feel rejuvenated, you feel fresh, and you don't have all the sweat bothering you and coming in your face, on your fingers, everywhere all over your body. It makes you feel better. “For me it is important to take that break. For someone else probably not. And everyone has his own time. I try and be as quick as I can. Sometimes I just need a bit more time. That's all.” ESPN’s Brad Gilbert also pointed out on air that once Tsitsipas returns to the court, he should be immediately ready to play instead of taking time near his chair.  “If you come back, you should play,” Gilbert said on air. As for the boos, Tsitsipas added: “I haven't done anything wrong, so I don't understand. The people love the sport; they come to watch tennis. I have nothing against them. I love the fans. But some people don't understand. That's all. They don't understand. They haven't played tennis at high level to understand how much effort and how much difficult it is to do what we are doing. Sometimes we need a short break to do what we have to do.” Adrian Mannarino, of France, returns a shot against Stefanos Tsitsipas, of Greece, during the second ... [+] round of the US Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Tsitsipas has been criticized by many of his fellow tennis players, including Olympic gold medalists Alexander Zverev and 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens. “It's happening every match,” Zverev said. “It happened to me in the French Open, to Novak at the finals [of] the French Open. You know, I think in Hamburg against [Filip] Krajinovic he was complaining, against me in Cincinnati was ridiculous, and now here again. I think players are catching up on that.” In Cincinnati, Tstsipas took his bag with his phone to the bathroom and Zverev accused him of getting illegal coaching via text from his father. “His dad is texting on the phone,” Zverev said. “He comes out, and all of a sudden his tactic completely changed. It's not just me, but everybody saw it. The whole game plan changes. ""I'm like, either it's a very magical place he goes to or there is communication there. But I also don't want to disrespect him. He is a great player,"" Zverev added. Following her win over Coco Gauff earlier Wednesday, Stephens, the 2017 Open champ, wondered if Tsitsipas needed help in the bathroom to make his trips shorter. “Yeah, like I don't think you should be gone from the court for, like, I don't know. Six, eight minutes is a long time to leave a match. That changes the whole momentum of a match. If you're changing your clothes, what are you changing? What are you doing in there?” she said. She added: “If you ever changed out of a wet sports bra, which I don't think you have, you wouldn't know how difficult that is. But that is maybe like a five-minute. When you get into six, seven, eight, nine minutes, okay, what are you doing in there? Do you need help? I can come help you. Like, what's happening?” Meantime, Mannarino got some tennis balls and practiced serves to keep his shoulder loose while Tsitsipas was away before the fourth set, He agreed that the fault lies with the rulebook, not Tsitsipas. “He's not doing anything wrong,”' the French player said. “I think the rule is wrong.''

"The Watcher (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) in Marvel Studios' WHAT IF…? exclusively on Disney+. ©Marvel ... [+] Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved. “Time...Space...Reality...It’s more than a linear path,” declares Uatu the Watcher (voiced by Westworld’s Jeffrey Wright) in the opening credits of Marvel Studios’ new What If...? anthology. “It’s a prism of endless possibility. Where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities...creating alternate ones from the worlds you know.” That’s just a fancy way of saying, “Welcome to the Marvel Multiverse! Have a seat, make yourself comfortable, and strap in because things are about to get really weird!” What If...? is a distillate of the MCU’s fourth phase, which — based on WandaVision, Loki, and the first trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home — is clearly committed to the concept of alternate realities stacked on top of each other. In other words, Kevin Feige & co. are boldly taking the shared comic book mythos where it’s never gone before.  The Star Trek comparison is rather apt since What If...? composer Laura Karpman looked to classic science fiction while crafting the title music for the animated series that not only remixes the MCU films we know, but their scores as well.  “They told me very early, before we even had animation, that there were gonna be images of shattering glass,” Karpman tells Forbes Entertainment. “So, we shattered glass out here on my patio, we recorded it, then we reversed it, and played with certain sound effect aspects of it ... I’m singing behind the French horn theme [which is] almost like a tribute to ‘60s sci-fi, where you’ve got the female voice.” Aside from that central motif, however, each episode proved to be a different animal. “I think it was really taking each one head-on and saying, ‘What does it need? What does this particular episode need? How does it live within the MCU? How does it depart from the MCU? How do we dress that musically?’” Karpman says. “Because everyone one of them lives within it and then leaves it to a certain extent. I think that’s the kind of challenge that you have to look at and then reflect that challenge musically.” Over the course of the last 13 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has benefitted from some of the most talented composers on the planet — from Alan Silvestri, to Michael Giacchino, to Ramin Djawadi, to Mark Mothersbaugh (the list really does go on). Karpman got to play with all of their scores, mixing and matching the pieces around like an imaginative kid playing with several LEGO sets at once. For the season premiere, in which Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) takes the super-soldier serum instead of Steve Rogers, Karpman used Silvestri’s main theme for Captain America: The First Avenger as a baseline before flipping it on its head.  “I literally took the Captain America theme, I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and then wherever the notes went up, I went down for the Captain Carter theme. I literally did a mirror image of it,” she explains. “It’s funny because I had access to all the scores, but a lot of the time, I almost preferred to do it by ear because it was almost easier to listen, take it in, draw from it what I wanted, and then leave it and do something else.” Captain Carter/Peggy Carter in Marvel Studios' WHAT IF…? exclusively on Disney+. ©Marvel Studios ...

Episode 2 proved to be a little trickier because it needed to blend two movies into one: James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy (scored by Tyler Bates) and Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther (scored by Ludwig Göransson). The story follows T’Challa (voiced by the late Chadwick Boseman) who adopts the mantle of Star-Lord after Yondu (Michael Rooker) takes the Wakandan prince under his wing instead of young Peter Quill. “It was, ‘Let’s take elements out of Ludwig’s score that are not orchestral, that are the other signatures that he so brilliantly put into that score. Let’s take Tyler’s theme and let’s mash em’ up and see what happens,’” Karpman says. “And it strangely works together pretty darn well, I think. I also think in 102 there’s a heist, which is original.

That was merely a warm-up compared to Episode 3, an Avengers-based murder mystery that plays out like a condensed crash course of the entirety of Phase 1. Instead of trying to mash six movies worth of scores into a 30-minute runtime, though, Karpman simply decided to just do her own thing. “For 103, it was really writing an original [score],” she adds. “Even though it’s this kind of Avengers thing, it was really more about writing an original theme for the mystery assassin. It was less about Avengers music and more about, ‘What is going on in this thing and who’s doing this?’” (Far left): Brock Rumlow and (center) Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in Marvel Studios' WHAT IF…? ...

The fourth and most recent installment presents a timeline in which Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) heads down a path of dark magic following the death of his colleague and love interest, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). For this one, Karpman wanted to tell “a very, very tragic love story” that explores the idea of “Where do you have control and where don’t you?” “[It’s] very, very sad and strange and tragic,” she continues. “The idea was to come up with a repetitive motif because it obviously fits in with the way the story is told and grow it and grow it and grow it and grow it.” Despite the fact that Episode 4 was first in line to probe the depths of multiversal mayhem we’ll eventually see in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Karpman insists that she didn’t see it that way. “It’s more [about] this guy [who] can’t be with the person he loves,” Karpman explains. “It doesn’t work. It’s not working, it’s not working, it’s not working. It’s not like the opening of the first film where you’ve got cities melting. It’s just he can’t make it work — no matter what he does, no matter how powerful he becomes.

"The global footprint of renewable energy varies dramatically by type of technology.  The construction and operation of energy generation projects will always cause some negative environmental and social impacts.  True, but the scope and scale of those negative impacts will vary dramatically based on the type of project and its location—a point recently driven home by two different research papers. One examines the global footprint of wind and solar projects. The other, of which I am a co-author, examines the global footprint of hydropower.  In the scientific journal Global Sustainability, a team of scientists led by WWF examined the impact of proposed hydropower development on the world’s free-flowing rivers, which provide multiple values to people, ranging from fisheries to the sediment needed to maintain agriculturally crucial deltas.  The team of scientists reported that development of planned hydropower dams would result in the loss of 260,000 kilometers of free-flowing rivers around the world.  That number may sound abstract, so here’s something perhaps more tangible: if all currently planned hydropower dams were built, they would fragment more than half (52%) of the remaining free-flowing big rivers in the tropics, including 61% of those in South America, 41% of those in Africa, and the only two free-flowing big tropical rivers in Asia (the Irrawaddy and Salween rivers).     For context, only one-third of the world’s biggest rivers—those over 1,000 kilometers in length—remain free-flowing today; hydropower dams are the primary reason that two-thirds of the world’s big rivers are no longer free-flowing.  Baihetan hydropower under construction in April 2021 in Zhaotong, Yunnan Province of China, on the ...

(Photo by Yan Keren/VCG via Getty Images) The remaining big, free-flowing rivers are clustered in two places: the far north (Canada and Siberia) and in the tropics (primarily in the Amazon and Congo basins, where the two rivers, and many of their largest tributaries, remain free-flowing). The big rivers of the tropics support the greatest diversity of freshwater species and the greatest values to people, including the largest freshwater fisheries in the world (such as the Mekong and Irrawaddy rivers).  The recent WWF study found that dams with a total of just over 200 GW of hydropower capacity are proposed for free-flowing rivers, with 75 GW of that on the biggest rivers. This level of development on big rivers would generate less than 1% of the renewable electricity needed by 2050 to meet the 1.5 degree climate target – even as it would fragment more than half of the world’s remaining large tropical rivers, a dramatic loss of a globally important ecosystem type.   Global river connectivity status and distribution of rivers that lose their free-flowing status ... [+] between current and future dam scenarios. Free-flowing rivers are in blue, non-free-flowing rivers in red. Rivers in yellow are currently free flowing but would no longer be considered free flowing if projected hydropower dams are built.   Researchers from The Nature Conservancy and the University of Minnesota also just released a study that gives insight on the global footprint of energy development. They examined a range of drivers of conversion of natural lands, including energy projects such as wind and solar, but also other major drivers such as agriculture, mining, and urbanization.  The researchers combined a range of projected expansions for each of the drivers and estimated a global total of 3.1 million km2 of land conversion – an area almost the size of India. The expansion of wind and solar PV was just 3% of the total, encompassing 94,000 km2., an area the size of Portugal.  Even if the drive for zero emissions increased the amount of wind and solar development by a factor of five (and fossil energy declined), renewables would still represent only about 20% of anticipated land conversions by 2050.  This is relatively small compared to other drivers, but conversion of natural lands the size of Portugal (or five Portugals) would still have substantial negative social and environmental impacts.   However, other research suggests that this level of wind and solar development does not need to require conversion of natural lands at all.  A 2019 study led by researchers at The Nature Conservancy (again, I was a co-author) reported that future wind and solar expansion could happen primarily on already developed lands, minimizing conflicts with other social and environmental resources. These “low impact” lands could include rooftops or the surface of reservoirs for solar panels or pastureland for wind. They estimated that there is enough potential wind and solar generation available on low-impact lands to meet the commitments under the Paris Agreement—17 times over. Solar PV can be built on top of building, such as here on the Staples Center in los Angeles (Photo ... [+] by David McNew/Getty Images) Because commitments under the Paris Agreement are not sufficient to reach the 1.5 degree climate target, they also looked at the amount of generation needed to meet a scenario of 100% renewables by 2050 (including electrification of transportation and heating). Even this much larger requirement for wind and solar generation could be developed strictly on already developed land (these areas have 1.6 times as much generation potential as would be needed to meet the 100% renewable scenario).  To return to the opening statements – all forms of electricity generation projects will have some social and environmental impacts, but these will vary greatly by type of project and location.  Meeting the high majority of needed renewable generation from wind and solar would have a total land conversion footprint that is relatively small compared to other drivers of land-use change—and there are abundant places where wind and solar projects can be built with minimal conflicts with other resources.  In other words, while wind and solar projects will require careful planning and siting, there is plenty of opportunity to successfully do that.  On the other hand, meeting less than 1% of needed renewable generation by building new hydropower dams on large free-flowing rivers will fragment more than half of a vitally important ecosystem type: large tropical rivers that currently remain free-flowing.   Unlike wind and solar, there are not abundant places to site hydropower with minimal impacts. The levels of hydropower expansion envisioned in plans by the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency, and others, would require the 212 GW proposed for free-flowing rivers, and so these projections can only be met through damming of free-flowing rivers.  The changes in energy systems required to meet climate targets will necessarily entail negative impacts and tradeoffs with other objectives. Understanding the differences between technologies in terms of relative impacts, extent of tradeoffs, and potential for low-impact siting will be essential to meeting climate goals in the most sustainable way.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffopperman/2021/09/02/energy-will-always-leave-footprints-projected-hydropower-would-leave-deeper-global-footprint-than-solar-and-wind/,Energy Will Always Leave Footprints: Projected Hydropower Would Leave Deeper Global Footprint Than Solar And Wind
"Joe Rogan reacts during UFC 249 at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena on May 09, 2020 in Jacksonville, ... [+] Florida. (Photo by Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images) Podcaster, comedian, and coronavirus lockdown skeptic Joe Rogan announced that he has tested positive for COVID-19 in a video posted to Instagram, in which he also admitted to taking the deworming drug Ivermectin as treatment for the virus.  Ivermectin has gained a reputation as a bizarre snake oil “cure” for Covid-19, as a number of anti-vaxxers have been ingesting doses of the medicine intended for livestock, i.e., horse deworming paste, in an attempt to bypass conventional treatment.  Rogan, who is extraordinarily wealthy and thus, unlikely to resort to consuming horse paste, is surely taking the human version of Ivermectin, which the CDC says is “not authorized or approved by the FDA for prevention or treatment of Covid-19.”  Rogan, however, didn’t limit himself to Ivermectin; he explained that his treatments also included monoclonal antibodies, Z-pack antibiotics, and a vitamin drip for ""three days in a row."" ""Here we are on Wednesday, and I feel great,"" he said. “I really only had one bad day. Today I feel good ... a wonderful, heartfelt thank you to modern medicine for pulling me out of this so quickly and easily.” It is unclear if Rogan has been vaccinated, although it's worth noting that the podcaster has a history of downplaying the effects of the coronavirus and has questioned why young, healthy people should take the vaccine. Rogan later clarified his comments, explaining that he is not ""an anti-vax person,"" and joked that he is not ""a respected source of information, even for me.""  Rogan has long had a reputation for spreading misinformation, as well as promoting questionable health supplements, especially since the pandemic started. Hence, the internet had some fun with his coronavirus diagnosis and subsequent Ivermectin treatment, safe in the knowledge that the podcaster had essentially recovered.      Others expressed concern that by mentioning Ivermectin, Rogan appeared to be endorsing the drug as a treatment for the virus, possibly embolding his audience to try it for themselves, minus the additional (highly expensive) treatments Rogan enjoyed.    Others jumped at the opportunity to make memes.   Clearly, Rogan needs to invite fellow comedian Bill Burr back onto the podcast; the last time Burr appeared as a guest, he mercilessly mocked Rogan’s refusal to listen to science, stating:  ""I'm not gonna sit here with no medical degree, listen to you with no medical degree."" Hopefully, Rogan makes a full and swift recovery—no thanks to the horse dewormer.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2021/09/02/the-internet-reacts-to-joe-rogan-taking-ivermectin-for-covid-19/,The Internet Reacts To Joe Rogan Taking Ivermectin For Covid-19
" Ambri liquid metal batteries. Lithium-ion batteries have some problems. They lose efficiency when the weather is too hot or cold. They lose the ability to fully charge over time. They can catch fire. And they are reliant on a China-controlled supply chain of critical minerals.  But even with those drawbacks, lithium-ion has become the dominant player in the painfully slow growing business of providing battery storage for renewable energy.  There are many new players in battery town seeking to take market share from lithium. One company that has been working on the problem for a decade now is Ambri, which has been largely funded by Bill Gates.  I learned about Ambri because it was the counterparty to the antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources that I wrote about in August. That led to a chat with Ambri Executive Chairman Dan Leff and Chief Commercial Officer Adam Briggs. “Ambri is a 10-year-old company that spun out of research from Professor Donald Sadoway’s laboratory at MIT,” Leff told me as we kicked off our discussion. “And it was the Masters and PhD thesis work of David Bradwell. They formed a liquid metal battery company after receiving one of the first ARPA-E grants for the MIT research, and received company funding from Bill Gates and Total.” Leff was approached about 3-1/2 years ago by the Bill Gates investment team to join the company’s board to help them assess if the company could be brought from the lab to the market at scale. Briggs, who has extensive management and commercial experience in the battery storage arena, also joined Ambri around the same time.  “We assessed that we needed to do three things in order to bring the company effectively from the lab to the market at scale,” Leff said. “Number one was to retire technology risk. Number two was to build a commercial pipeline of opportunities by asking the market, ‘if we build this product at this price and performance point, would you buy at scale?’” The Ambri team was able to tick off the first two boxes and then went to work on addressing the third key goal: Raising adequate capital to take the company to commercial scale.  Leff said the building of a strong syndicate of investors is critical. “While the company has largely been funded over the most recent several years by Bill Gates, that’s not their team’s investment model,” he told me. “Their model is to build a strong syndicate, and we have been grateful to assemble a world-class group of investors with this round, led by Paulson & Co. and Reliance Industries. Paulson & Co. has a tie-back to Perpetua Resources, and the [antimony] mine in Idaho and Reliance Industries is going to be our partner in India for manufacturing and distribution.” So, why is a secure and plentiful supply of antimony important to Ambri? Because it is one of just two metal elements needed for the company’s liquid metal battery technology that Ambri believes is the real solution to the energy storage problem that lithium-ion technology has been unable to satisfy. The only other metal needed is calcium metal, which Briggs informed me is the “fifth-most available element on the planet. So, we have no concerns about our ability to source calcium metal.” I noted that Perpetua’s current targeted start-up date for its Idaho mine is 2027 and asked if that lines up with Ambri’s own commercialization goals. “We’re excited about Perpetua because they come online and ramp up our domestic supply in ways that give us onshore supply chain security into the future,” Leff said.  That is critical, not just for Ambri, but for everyone in the Energy Transition space. Securing supply chains for the required critical minerals is also a focus area of the Biden-Harris administration, and as has been the case in every related story I’ve written on this subject this year, we see the goals and timelines of the companies involved aligning with those of the government. The big question is whether some of these minerals - lithium is a prime example - can see their production increased at the radical pace required to meet the needs of the renewables and EV industries. MIT professor and battery expert Donald Sadoway holds up the Slimcell battery he invented and ... [+] patented, in the lab on Feb. 3, 2006. (Photo by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Ambri does not need lithium or any of the other critical minerals required by lithium-ion technology. So, this technology solves for that big potential problem. According to Briggs, the company’s liquid metal batteries also solve for all of the other chronic issues that have limited lithium-ion’s ability to grow to real scale in power generation.  “Ambri batteries are high-temperature batteries,” Briggs said. “They operate at an elevated temperature, which allows the calcium metal to melt into a liquid. It allows the salt electrolyte to melt into a liquid. As a result of those being liquids, you have an operating battery that has an insignificant amount of degradation over its lifetime.” So, problem #1 addressed.  “Now you have a 20-year battery that doesn’t degrade over its lifetime,” he continued. “That’s versus a lithium-ion battery, which typically is going to have about a 10-year end-of-life, and gradually degrades over that period of time.” Problem #2, addressed.  “The Ambri batteries are hermetically sealed, stainless-steel containers,” he went on. “That’s important from a battery perspective because it means there is no need for that battery to release pressure via a vent. All other batteries that you are familiar with from a commercial world have a tendency to generate a gas pressure from inside that battery, and consequently they’re designed with a vent in case the pressure gets too high. When they activate that vent, then flammable gases come out. That’s what happens in a lithium-ion fire.” Problem #3, addressed. “With Ambri, you have a longer-life, lower-cost, safer battery,” Briggs concluded. “That’s what the energy storage market is looking for, and that’s the reason we’re coming to market and hoping to gain our fair share of it versus lithium-ion.” While this all sounds great, no one at Ambri lives under the illusion that their technology will ultimately enable renewables to supply 100% of the world’s energy needs, or certainly not on the aggressive timetable goals set by the Biden administration.  “We’re not sitting here saying that the world is going to go 100% renewables anytime soon,” Briggs said. “It’s going to take a long time, and it may never get to 100%. But from a cost perspective, we can get to 80-90% renewable in the foreseeable future and achieve a lower cost to ratepayers. That transition will be a huge improvement for the planet. It will require a lot of batteries, but chosen correctly, that will result in a lower cost overall to ratepayers.” It’s that “chosen correctly” part that will likely become the biggest hill to climb for Ambri and every other company involved in this Energy Transition. The U.S. government does not have a strong track record related to “choosing correctly” in its myriad efforts to pick winners and losers in the energy space over the decades. Governments in other countries, like Germany and France, have been no better in this regard. What can be said here with confidence is that Ambri has a promising new battery technology that has been developed and backed by some very smart and visionary people that, if properly deployed, could help renewables like wind and solar scale up more rapidly in the coming years and help them occupy a larger share of electricity generation around the world. There probably will never be any magic bullets that will somehow make this Energy Transition become reality overnight, but there will be game changers, and Ambri’s liquid metal battery technology might well be one of them.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/09/02/bill-gates-backed-startup-might-change-the-renewable-energy-storage-game/,"A Decade In Development, Liquid-Metal Batteries By Ambri May Soon Change The Energy Storage Game"
"House Democrats investigating the events of Jan. 6 have named Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.) as the committee’s vice chairman, the Democrat in charge announced Thursday, in an unusual move designed to stave off criticism of the probe’s political leaning.

(Photo by Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images) Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chair of the House select committee probing the U.S. Capitol riots, praised Cheney’s “commitment to getting answers about January 6th” in a statement announcing the decision.  It is an unusual move for House Democrats to pick someone from the opposite party for such a high-ranking role on the committee, but Thompson said Cheney’s selection “underscores the bipartisan nature of this effort.”  In a statement accepting the appointment, Cheney vowed to not let the committee be “deterred by threats or attempted obstruction.”   “Every member of this committee is dedicated to conducting a non-partisan, professional, and thorough investigation of all the relevant facts regarding January 6th and the threat to our Constitution we faced that day,” Cheney said. “I have accepted the position of Vice-Chair of the committee to assure that we achieve that goal.”  Cheney, who has been a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump and his ongoing influence over the Republican Party, is one of just two Republicans on the select committee. This position will give her a much more significant role in steering the direction of the investigation, which started to gain momentum last week with several rounds of records and documents requests to social media platforms, federal agencies and more.  Cheney’s position in the Jan. 6 committee’s leadership will likely draw the ire of House Republicans, who have been pressuring House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.) to punish Cheney and Kinzinger for their involvement.  Freedom Caucus Chair Rep.

"Webasto Group’s Roof Sensor Module with Luminar’s Iris as the Primary Lidar Sensor  So-called advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) could prove to be the real beneficiary as widespread adoption of robotaxis and other automated vehicles (AVs) remain stuck in small scale pilot programs around the world. While engineers continue to work on AVs and the supporting technologies to remove the human driver, those bits and pieces are finding their way into the vehicles we will be buying in the coming years. At next week’s IAA Mobility show in Munich, Germany, Luminar will be demonstrating how its high-performance lidar sensors can be utilized for ADAS to make roads safer. There are already several vehicles going on sale this year that are utilizing lidar sensors for ADAS with more expected in 2022 and beyond. Honda is selling a limited number Legend sedans in Japan with a level 3 conditionally automated system that utilized five Valeo Scala lidar sensors. Mercedes-Benz is also using one of those sensors for its L3 Drive Pilot on the new S-Class and EQS launching later this year in Germany while Xpeng’s new P5 sedan uses a pair of Livox sensors and Toyota is using a Denso lidar on its hands-free Teammate system.  However, all of those L2 and L3 systems that allow the driver take their hands off the steering wheel under certain driving conditions are actually convenience features rather than strictly focused on enhancing safety. Luminar’s focus is on the latter as CEO Austin Russell has been promoting the concept of proactive safety. Unlike airbags and seatbelts that are reactive by helping to protect vehicle occupants after an impact, proactive safety involves trying to prevent crashes in the first place.  Early active safety systems included anti-lock brakes, traction control and stability control, all of which were designed to help the driver maintain control and make the vehicle respond in the way the driver intended. Those systems had limited ability to perceive the environment using wheel speed sensors, accelerometers, yaw rate and other data about what the driver was requesting and how the vehicle was responding to the road conditions.  Modern ADAS takes this a step further with cameras, radar and now lidar that can “see” away from the interface between the tires and the road. Cameras and increasingly radar have become ubiquitous on mainstream vehicles in the past five years but they have significant limitations. In most cases, vehicles have just one forward facing camera which means they can classify objects, but they have to rely on inherently problematic machine learning approaches to guess how far away objects are. As an active sensor, radar is better, but current low cost radar sensors have very low resolution and limited ability to distinguish different targets. New imaging radar sensors are much better and should start arriving in some vehicles by the end of 2021.  Lidar is also an active sensor, sending out its own light pulses and measuring the reflections with much higher resolution than even the best imaging radar. Luminar will be demonstrating a Lexus 
  
  PLXS 
  RX equipped with its Hydra lidar sensors for pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking (AEB). In a video published by the company, it can be seen alongside a Tesla 
  
  TSLA 
  Model X and an Audi A5 approaching “walking” pedestrian mannequins. While the Tesla and Audi can be seen braking, the response always comes too late to avoid striking the pedestrians. The Luminar-equipped Lexus stops short before impact every time.  Lidar can provide more accurate distance measurements than a single camera or even the tri-focal system used by Tesla where the three cameras are clustered together above the rear view mirror. Accurate distance measurements with cameras requires spreading cameras apart to achieve parallax. Subaru’s EyeSight system does this but the detection distance is limited by the cameras only being about 12 feet apart. Companies like Light are developing multi-view camera systems with the cameras mounted near the A-pillars that are claimed to provide accurate distance measurements out to 1,000 m. This type of camera installation is visible in the rendering of the Inalfa rooftop integration.  Inalfa’s roof integration of Luminar’s Iris also shows wide-based multi-view cameras Luminar has developed its own perception software to power this pedestrian detection and AEB system. It is also working with tier one suppliers Webasto and Inalfa to integrate its production-intent Iris sensor which is much slimmer than the Hydra that is used for development purposes. The first application of the Iris will come in the 2022 replacement for the current Volvo XC90. While Volvo plans to eventually enhance the capabilities of its Luminar equipped system to enable highway automated driving, it will include this sort of proactive safety capability from launch.  Luminar isn’t the only lidar vendor targeting these sorts of applications. European regulators are upgrading the standards for the European New Car Assessment Program (EuroNCAP) for 2023 and plan to include performance tests of AEB, pedestrian detection and other features in environments beyond daylight. Companies like Continental and Ibeo are launching low-cost flash lidar sensors. These don’t have the same ultimate performance of sensors like Luminar, Aeye and others, but they should provide a significant boost over current monovision camera and radar configurations. Combining all three and potentially others like near infrared or thermal imaging cameras can provide even more roboust and reliable sensing in all weather and lighting conditions.  Luminar hopes to get its Iris sensors into high-volume proactive safety systems within the next 3-4 years as vehicle development programs now kicking off come to market. As production scale starts to reach into the millions of units per year, these systems are likely cost just a few hundred dollars.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/02/lidar-makers-target-proactive-safety-as-automated-driving-remains-on-the-horizon/,Lidar Makers Target Proactive Safety As Automated Driving Remains On The Horizon
"Acting has been a happy surprise for singer-composer Choi Youngjae. Choi Young-jae first dreamt of becoming a singer when he was a child, but it was watching the 2019 film Joker that excited his interest in acting.  “When I saw the characters that actor Joaquin Phoenix interpreted, I felt it was amazing,” he said. “It was really interesting to see the interpretation with many different vibes even though it was one character.” Choi, known simply as Youngjae, had his first acting credit in 2015, while performing as the main vocalist of the seven-member k-pop group GOT7. He played himself in the 12-episode web series Dream Knight, which also featured other members of the band. It was not until 2021 that Youngjae’s newly ignited interest in acting led to a cameo in a VLIVE sitcom, a leading role in a musical and a part in the Netflix 
  
  NFLX 
  sitcom So Not Worth It.  Acting proved to be a happy surprise. “I was amazed to see myself acting,” said Youngjae. “In fact, I never imagined that I would be acting. When I act, I do some things that I don’t usually do, and I like how I look at that time because it’s new and interesting.” So Not Worth It focuses on a group of students with different backgrounds attending an international college in Seoul. It stars Park Se-wan, Shin Hyun-seung, Han Hyun-min and Thai singer-actress Minnie. Youngjae plays  the Korean-Australian second-year student Sam, whose father owns a spicy rice cake (tteokbokki) restaurant chain.   “I thought I could pull it off well without disturbing other actors,” said Youngjae. “It was amazing that we could get close quickly, even though friends of various nationalities gathered, and the atmosphere on the site was good and it was always fun, as we got close. I am grateful that non-Korean actors were able to speak Korean really well because I think that was the reason why we could get close easily.” Youngjae’s involvement with dramas also extends to singing for and composing soundtracks.  He contributed songs to the soundtracks of the TV dramas Wok of Love, When My Love Blooms, So I Married An Anti Fan, My Roommate Is A Gumiho and So Not Worth It. He also released songs from the musical Midnight Sun, which he starred in.  Midnight Sun is based on the Japanese film A Song To The Sun, about a woman whose rare condition makes exposure to sunlight dangerous. Despite never having acted on stage, Youngjae happily faced the challenge of playing Ha-ram, a leading role in the musical. Movies, musicals or dramas—he’s willing to act in a variety of media. “I think musicals, movies and dramas all have their own charms,” he said. “I want to appear regardless of the musical, movie, or drama, if there is a role that suits me or if I have a chance.” Youngjae has composed more than a dozen songs since 2016, writing for GOT7 and other musical artists, including Defsoul and Noday. He composes using the name Ars. “I wanted to distinguish composer Youngjae from singer Youngjae,” he said. In 2020 he contributed his warm mellow voice to the song Everything For You, created for an organ donation campaign promoted by the Korean Network for Organ Sharing. He registered as an organ donor the same year.  “I don’t think there would be any better sharing, then if an organ donation could make another person's life better,” he said. “That’s why I decided to donate my organs and participate in the campaign.” He is currently working on new music, with plans to release an album this year. “I’ll make it better and come back with a great album, so please look forward to it.” Although he’s currently pursuing acting and other solo activities, Youngjae retains his enthusiasm about performing with GOT7. “GOT7 is still together, and we’ll be together forever,” said Youngjae. “Please continue to love GOT7’s activities.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2021/09/02/youngjae-never-imagined-he-would-act-but-hes-ready-for-more-chances/,Youngjae Never Imagined He Would Act But He’s Ready For More Chances

"Far Cry 6 I recently attended a Far Cry 6 remote hands-on preview event and was able to play several hours of the upcoming open-world shooter’s single-player campaign, and a bit of that campaign in co-op.  The preview was remote so the game I played didn’t look as good as the final product (at least on my end) and I had to juggle some technical issues before I could really sink my teeth into it (mainly input lag, which won’t be an issue at release). But overall, I enjoyed my time with the game and didn’t experience many bugs with the game itself (as opposed to the software running it remotely). It will probably shock no one to learn that the game is very, very similar to Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4 and Far Cry 5, as this is a franchise that certainly iterates, that changes exotic locales and nefarious villains, but still feels astonishingly similar from one game to the next. Far Cry 6 is set in the fictional island nation of Yara—essentially Far Cry’s Cuba—ruled by the ruthless but charismatic Antón Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito).  Castillo wants to turn Yara into a paradise—or at least that’s his equivalent of “Make America Great Again”—and it doesn’t matter how many men, women and children he has to kill to get the job done. He’s also turning the island into a pharmaceutical research lab and you, Dani Rojas, alongside a zany team of freedom fighters, have to stop him and set things right. Here we come to our first problem with the game. A brutal dictator ruthlessly murdering countless of his own citizens, sometimes directly in front of his young son, sounds like the trappings of a very dark game—and sometimes Far Cry 6 wants you to think of it that way. It’s dark, it’s violent, it has something to say about the post-colonial world. But also you have a pet alligator who follows you around, and an adorable pet chihuahua. The alligator will tear enemies to shreds in a heartbeat; the chihuahua is more of a charmer. Oh, and your new pal Juan Cortez will help you craft all the weapons your heart desires, including super-powered backpacks called Supremos that can fire rocket barrages or give you the ability to jetpack around like Iron Man (sort of) and so on and so forth. It’s wacky! It’s grimdark! It doesn’t know what the hell it wants to be . . . .  Far Cry 6 Far Cry 6 is the ultimate AAA open-world game, at once attempting to be a Very Serious game about colonialism and tyranny and a goofy FPS sandbox extravaganza. If you get a bit of tonal whiplash while playing don’t be surprised. This, of course, is nothing new for the series. There are callouts to Far Cry 3—burning fields of genetically altered tobacco is a direct nod to that game’s pot-burning mission—which makes you reminisce fondly about that 2012 game. Far Cry 3 was the first game in the series to really set the formula for what we have now. Both Far Cry and Far Cry 2 are quite a bit different from what followed. Far Cry 3 was widely praised when it released and it really was a great game, but now three main games later, almost a decade after its release, we’re still largely doing the same things, for better or worse. The setting changes. New characters arrive. But the formula is more predictable than ever. Zanier weapons? Yeah, Far Cry 5 already started down that path and it didn’t make that game any better. Like that game, Far Cry 6’s Supremo and other DIY weapons never make the gameplay as over-the-top as you’d hope. Again, this is a problem with tone: Ubisoft doesn’t know if it wants to make a serious first-person shooter with a grounded narrative or a wacky sandbox with a silly narrative, and so it waffles endlessly between the two. Far Cry 6 While much of this is just par for the course with a new Far Cry, there is one change in Far Cry 6 that is so decidedly awful I’m not sure I can emphasize how badly I want Ubisoft to change it before October 7th when the game comes out. Enemies now have different vulnerabilities to different types of ammo. So “heavy” guards and “light” guards are now more easily killed with two different ammo types, for instance, and you can mod your weapons accordingly.  This is enormously stupid. You basically get 4 weapons at a time, one of which is your Supremo. If you want to take down enemies at a distance, you’ll need a sniper rifle. But if your sniper rifle is modded for standard rounds you won’t be able to one-shot heavies; if it’s modded for armor-piercing rounds you won’t be able to one-shot other types of enemies. The point is, you’d essentially need two separate sniper rifles with different types of ammo to take down enemies from range. In closer quarters this becomes agonizing. Six or seven different enemies rushing you at once, you can’t really tell which is which and now you have to swap between guns based not on how they fire, what range they fire best at etc. (all the types of previous considerations you’d make) but on the ammo type and who’s vulnerable to what. This is not fun, Ubisoft. This is a chore. Far Cry 6 Yes! You see, I’m a sucker for this type of sandbox game and for the Far Cry series in particular even though I get frustrated by the sameness between titles, even though I wish they’d stick to a tone. Getting to drive around (or ride horseback this time—how on earth were horses not a thing in Far Cry 5, which was set in my home state of Montana???) and take over enemy bases and parachute from helicopters and ride your squirrel suit down the sides of mountains and all the other silly things you can do in these games is a blast. Besides, Yara is gorgeous. The new island setting, with its bustling urban areas and its beautiful wilderness, is yet another great area to explore. We’ve had tropical islands (Far Cry 3) and the snowy Himalayas (Far Cry 4) and the wide-open prairies and mountains of Montana (Far Cry 5) not to mention all the spin-offs, and now we have more tropical islands though of a very different flavor than Far Cry 3. Yara is earthier, browner, more rugged and lived in than the green tropics of Far Cry 3’s Rook Islands. Watch my hands-on video preview, including footage captured from my playthrough, below: I don’t love the Supremo or the new ammo nonsense but I always have fun finding ways to sneak in and take down an enemy base. Plus, co-op is fantastic fun. I played around four hours of Far Cry 6 and definitely enjoyed the game during the last hour or so when I was fast-forwarded to a much later mission, equipped with a much more robust arsenal and then joined a second player to test out co-op. In the co-op session, myself and another player flew our helicopter out over an enemy base and then parachuted in. I landed on the central building and started sniping enemies silently. He took a different approach and when the bad guys noticed us we mopped them up in no time. It was a perfectly executed operation, which is more than I can say for some of my attempts at taking down an enemy fort. We took a boat to another base—I didn’t do any story stuff during this part of the session, opting to just go to enemy POI and eviscerate the enemy forces—and set up at sniper distance and took down the entire base without the enemy even spotting us, which was hilarious. As far as things like exploration and platforming went, everything seemed just fine and pretty familiar. Grapple here, jump to this ledge, blow this obstruction up and proceed. Take damage, light a cigar and use it to cauterize the wound. Rinse, repeat. I’m okay with all of this. Sure, I sometimes wish that Far Cry would dial it back a little, putting a little more emphasis on telling a good story and letting us use our own creativity to take down enemies rather than all these wacky weapons—or, conversely, making our arsenal so insane that the story and missions have to rise to that level also. But the Supremo is no super-suit with its long charge times and ultimately this game remains just grounded enough not to fly, and just flighty enough not to be grounded. But still fun as an open-world FPS sandbox, so if that’s your idea of a good time you probably won’t be disappointed. We’ll see on October 7th when the game releases on Xbox One, PS4, Xbox Series X, PS5, PC and Stadia.  Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

"A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B aboard HMS 'Queen Elizabeth.' The U.S. Marine Corps plans to embark F-35B jump jets on Japan’s new aircraft carriers. The move, announced by Marine commandant Gen. David Berger during an online event on Wednesday, accelerates an important trend. More and more, the Marine Corps is an air-power provider, embarking its planes not only on carriers belonging to the U.S. Navy, but also on allied navies’ own carriers.  Sharing jets also means sharing the intelligence those jets collect, Berger stressed during the webinar sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.  The goal, of course, is singular. Deter China in peacetime. Defeat China in wartime. “We’re both trying to gain an advantage,” Berger said of the United States and its biggest rival. USMC planes—AV-8B and F-35B jump jets and conventional F/A-18s and F-35Cs—long have flown from the U.S. Navy’s nine big-deck assault ships (the jump jets) as well as two of the Navy’s 11 nuclear-powered supercarriers (the conventional fighters).  More recently, the Corps embarked a squadron of 10 F-35Bs aboard the Royal Navy’s new flattop HMS Queen Elizabeth. The British vessel joined three other big-deck ships—the assault ship USS America, the supercarrier USS Carl Vinson and the Japanese helicopter carrier JS Ise—in the waters south of Okinawa last week.  Add the 18 F-35Bs on Queen Elizabeth—10 USMC jets plus eight from the Royal Air Force—to the six or so Marine F-35Bs on America and the 10 Marine F-35Cs on Vinson, and you have the biggest concentration of maritime stealth fighters anywhere, ever. The Japanese navy is set to play an even greater role in allied naval operations in the Western Pacific once it finishes modifying its two Izumo-class helicopter carriers to make them compatible with the 42 F-35Bs Tokyo is acquiring. Izumo began her $30 million rework last summer. Her newer sister Kaga is scheduled for alteration—reinforcement of her deck and removal of a bow-mounted gun—in 2022. The Japanese Air Self-Defense Force’s F-35Bs should enter service starting in 2024. That means there will be a gap of around three years where Izumo can embark F-35Bs, but the JASDF doesn’t yet have jump jets to offer. The Marines could fill that gap, much in the same way they’re helping to populate Queen Elizabeth and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales’ decks while the RAF slowly builds up its own inventory of at least 48 F-35Bs. The Marine Corps is buying 400 or so F-35s, making it by far the biggest operator of carrier-compatible stealth jets. Berger said F-35Bs—presumably some of the 20 USMC jump jets that are forward-deployed to Japan—would fly from Izumo in October. He stressed that the flights did not entail a “deployment,” apparently meaning the embarkment would be small-scale, short in duration and experimental in nature. But count on the Marine F-35Bs to return once Izumo and her sister are in regular service and the Japanese navy and air force—and the Marines themselves, for that matter—are more comfortable with the F-35. Cross-decking Marine jets on allied carriers is central to the Marine Corps’ war plans. That’s because the F-35B with its stealth and sophisticated sensors is an important intelligence-gathering platform for the Corps.  In the event of war with China, Marine forces would operate inside the range of Chinese missiles in order to scout for Chinese forces, while also intercepting and destroying China’s own scouts. Scouting and counterscouting “is a key role for us moving forward,” Berger said.  The more decks—American, British, Japanese, whatever—that are available to support the F-35Bs, the more widely the fighters can range and the more enemy attacks the overall force can absorb. But that allied force must be able to make good use of the intelligence the F-35s collect. That means separating out the classified data and sharing what legally can be shared.  This info-parsing might require a Marine F-35 squadron to install special data-handling facilities on any allied ship it flies from. That’s exactly what the Marines on Queen Elizabeth did, Berger explained. “We are working our way through that in a very good way.” Japan and the United Kingdom aren’t the only U.S. allies acquiring new aircraft carriers that are compatible with the F-35B. Italy is refurbishing one assault ship and finishing construction on another. South Korea is working with the U.K. to build a small flattop. More decks are on the way. The Marines are figuring out how to put jets on potentially all of them.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/09/02/japanese-carrier-american-jets-this-kind-of-mix-is-becoming-a-trend/,Japanese Aircraft Carriers.

"Human rights lawyer and Afghan refugee Tahmina Ghaffer continues to support women through her ... [+] business Moonflowers, a premium saffron company. Moonflower sources exclusively from Afghan women in Herat, Afghanistan. The future of the women who supply her company is uncertain under Taliban rule. Tahmina Ghaffer started Moonflowers in 2020 as a homage to Afghanistan. Moonflowers is a premium saffron company. Her brand was inspired by Middle Eastern poetry, architecture, and her ancestors; her mission is to bring dignified work to women in Afghanistan. She works exclusively with women in the Herat province of Afghanistan to harvest this delicate crop; for just one pound of saffron, over 50,000 flowers are harvested. I recently spoke to Ghaffer, a refugee herself, about the future of her company in a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Here is the full interview.  The inspiration behind Moonflowers is empowering women in Afghanistan. The saffron industry has been growing and Afghanistan has been producing premium quality saffron. The workforce behind this beautiful spice are Afghan women who handpick the saffron flowers during harvest season in October/November. Most women in rural areas have no access to the labor market and being able to work and earn their own income is meaningful empowerment. As the industry was growing, the jobs were developing as well. There was more need for jobs in quality control, saffron seasonal laborers employment agencies, and there’s even a female saffron women growers association. Saffron has been a national movement, uniting farmers in support of growing saffron as opposed to growing poppy [harvested for opium]. Poppy was a means of survival— farmers are proud to grow saffron, the spice of life, which also happens to be as lucrative.  Moonflower founder and CEO Tahmina Ghaffer shares, ""Harvesting saffron is a delicate and labor ... [+] intensive process; it takes between 50,000 to 70,000 saffron flowers to produce one pound of the spice. The premium quality saffron from Afghanistan is new to the market, though it has been used for centuries as a culinary herb and is known for its calmative, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties."" My family decided to leave Afghanistan when I was five, just before the civil war in the 90s. We became refugees and settled in the Netherlands, where I grew up and completed my degree in International Law. My motivation has always been giving back to people in need and contributing to justice. Ultimately, this has led me to this journey to start a saffron business. I wanted to be part of the saffron movement in Afghanistan, and through that, contribute to empowering women in Afghanistan. Afghan women have been through a lot, we are very resilient and I think it’s important to shed light on that by offering this premium quality spice that not only flavors food but has health benefits as well. Harvesting of saffron is a delicate process and farmers prefer women to harvest it. Most farmers now aren’t sure whether they will allow women to work on the field at all. The gap in the market lies in the story of the women behind the saffron spice, the health benefits of saffron, education on what makes premium saffron, and sharing this with a broad audience. Harvesting saffron is a delicate and labor intensive process; it takes between 50,000 to 70,000 saffron flowers to produce one pound of the spice. The premium quality saffron from Afghanistan is new to the market, though it has been used for centuries as a culinary herb and is known for its calmative, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties.  We work with two partner farms in the Herat province of Afghanistan. I’m in touch with one of the girls representing her family in selling the saffron and she has made it here. She’s shared that no one knows if the women are allowed to go back to work during harvest season. People in general are very scared of repercussions by the Taliban and my sources tell me that women were told not to go to work on the fields to harvest saffron. With that said, there are now a lot of logistical issues with getting saffron out of Afghanistan. People were hopeful for these emerging industries, myself very much included, as it created so many jobs and prosperity. These past few weeks have been very difficult for me. I was reliving my own childhood trauma of becoming a refugee. The images of people trying to evacuate at the Kabul airport were devastating and we really feel the pain and fear of people. Every time I talk to my family members in Kabul and in the Netherlands, everyone keeps telling me how they feel heartbroken. And that’s what it is: collective heartbreak. The feeling that you are from this homeland that knows no peace and justice is very painful. Most of my direct family had left during the 80s and 90s, though as Afghan families are usually very large, we still have many family members who are stuck in Kabul. I keep hearing from my cousins how scared they are. Most of the girls were crying because they were afraid to be taken away by the Taliban.  We are hopeful that people will unite with the National Resistance Front, stand for a just Afghanistan, and resist the oppression by the Taliban. During the civil war in the 90s, most of my generation left the country as children. We are now older and will not stand by and do nothing.  We will always be hopeful and actively make efforts for a better future for Afghanistan, a better future for the children and women of Afghanistan. Saffron is the central ingredient in dishes like Persian tahdig and Spanish paella. It used to be ... [+] grown widely in the Middle East and Europe; now, the majority of production comes from Iran. Moonflower founder/CEO Tahmina Ghaffer drinks saffron tea daily.  I have saffron supplies that will last until Spring 2022 and I’m in touch with my suppliers to see how we can import more Afghan saffron. The future is very unclear for everyone at this point. We do not know what the future holds particularly for women and girls in Afghanistan. Our goal is that Moonflowers continues to provide a way to uplift and empower Afghan women.  The recent events make it more challenging, but it’s one we will gladly take on.  My hope is freedom, justice and democracy for all the people of Afghanistan. We deserve better than this. Twenty years of progress have been taken away by the Taliban right now, but we will continue to find ways to source premium quality saffron from Afghanistan. People are resilient and will find ways to get it out.  For right now the best way to help is to donate to organizations that help refugees with resettlement. Some of the organizations that we have been supporting are International Rescue Committee (IRC), Women for Afghan Women, and we have been donating meals (our restaurant Sheesh Grill) to Afghan refugees who arrived at the Dulles International Airport through World Central Kitchen. You can follow us at @moonflowers_co and check out our website for resources to help Afghan refugees. We’ve also added a direct donation option to our shop page on www.Moonflowers.co to prompt customers to make an impact through a vetted organization. 100% of those donations will be going to the International Rescue Committee, whose mission is dedicated to helping displaced people find their footing after facing these unimaginable circumstances.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaynaharris/2021/09/02/this-afghan-entrepreneur-launched-moonflowers-to-support-female-saffron-producers-with-the-taliban-in-power-what-comes-next/,"This Afghan Entrepreneur Launched Moonflowers To Support Female Saffron Producers.

"An electric motor cab and driver, London, c1897-c1900. T They suffered from various faults and were ... [+] taken off the road in 1900. Artist York & Son. (Photo by English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Much of the media coverage on electric vehicles consists of either glowing reports of planned models and booming sales (in select markets) or on the other end, descriptions of expensive battery recalls or autopilot failures. Few if any of these reports are analytical in nature, and do not shed much light on the prospects for electric vehicles in the next few years.  I often feel like the guy in the old commercial who, listening to a sales pitch about a new microwave, keeps mumbling, “But does it brown the food?” There are any number of people who rave about electric vehicles’ attributes—you don’t have to stop at gas stations; you just press a button and it goes; you can recharge while you get lunch—but they leave me mumbling “But will everyone want to buy one?” Consumer acceptance is a funny thing and difficult to predict. (Organic dog food? Really?) There are always early adopters and people who like the exotic, but when it comes to mass markets, some things tend to be true, or at least most of the time. My mother loved the Checker brand automobiles but they were pretty rare on the road except for Yellow Cabs. (Ken Burns documentary series on the national parks has one at Yellowstone that might actually be us on our 1965 vacation.) In order to dominate the transportation sector as projected in most ‘Green’ scenarios, EV sales need to grow dramatically.  I’ve recently analyzed the prospects for electric vehicles and while the newest models are very impressive, I am skeptical about their ability to move beyond being a niche market—albeit a pretty good sized and growing niche. Recent research is worth noting as it provides some insight into the prospects for EVs to achieve the ambitious targets some are setting.  Aside from predicting consumer preferences, the still-evolving technology means that data from the past decade is of limited usefulness. But of course, forecasters and pundits can’t throw up their hands and say, “We don’t know,” kind of like Yoda saying, “Always in motion is the future.” (One of the most profound comments in Star Wars, which says something for the scripts.) Fortunately, there is some recent research that is interesting and informative, albeit not definitive. A recent NBER paper[i] estimated the miles driven by EV owners using utility bills in California; by looking at the increased power consumption and using mileage per kilowatt hour estimates they concluded that most EVs were used for commuting, not for longer trips. Roughly 6000 miles per year was what the average EV travelled, which is less than half for the average vehicle overall (15,000 miles). The implication is that EV owners treat them as second cars, not their primary vehicles. It also means that the cost per mile is much higher for EVs than most estimates, because most of the costs are for the vehicles, not the fuel, and applying it over 40% as many the miles as a conventional vehicle more than doubles the cost per mile.  Scott Hardman and Gil Tal published research in Nature Energy[ii] that showed about 20% of Californians who owned electric vehicles switched back to ICE vehicles. Interestingly, the limited range of EVs didn’t seem to be the biggest driver of the switch, but rather lack of access to charging (something the government can address). Also, quite a number of those who switched to ICEs seemed ready to return to EVs, apparently when charging infrastructure improved and perhaps with newer, more advanced EV models.  This was followed by a KAPSARC study[iii] written by Rubal Dua and Prateek Bansal which used survey research covering the U.S. more broadly, finding that about half of EV buyers switched back to ICEs. The higher percentage, they theorize, is due to Californians’ greater environmental concerns. The figure below shows the reasons given for switching from EVs back to oil-fueled cars, and they are similar to what Hardman and Tal found, although range was more important than charging availability. Again, this makes sense as many urban drivers in California have lengthy commutes, but much spent in heavy traffic where EVs don’t draw on power. People in much of the country have longer commutes and thus might find the limited range more important. Reasons EV buyers switched back to ICE vehicles This all provides some grounds for optimism: EVs might gain popularity as second or commuter cars for families and government spending is planned to increase the access to charging stations significantly. On the other hand, given the relatively immature market for EVs (very few are more than three or four years old), the high cost of battery replacement has not yet affected many drivers, and the resale value of the most recent models is an unknown.  Again, like all such research, while it may be very informative it is hardly definitive, particularly about the long-term prospects for electric vehicles with continually evolving technology and government support. However, it implies that the near-term prospects might not be so rosy, as consumer experiences prove more negative amongst the larger market than EVs have penetrated to date.

"Apple has been hit with an antitrust suit in India which accuses the company of abusing its dominant position in the smartphone apps business by essentially forcing app developers to pay a commission on all in-app transactions, the latest in a series of similar antitrust investigations faced by the iPhone maker in the U.S., Europe and Asia. India is the latest in a list of countries where Apple's app store practices face possible antitrust ... [+] investigations. According to Reuters, the suit against Apple has been filed by a non-profit group with the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The plaintiffs are reportedly arguing that Apple’s enforcement of its own payment system on app-based purchases—which comes with a commission fee of up to 30%—hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers. As with all cases pertaining to competition issues in India, the CCI has not made the details of this case public. The CCI is expected to review the case in the coming weeks after which it may dismiss the case or order a wider probe into Apple’s practices. Any investigation could be a major blow to Apple which views India as a key growth market. Both Apple and Google mandate that app developers on their iOS or Android mobile platforms use their proprietary billing system for charging customers on all digital purchases. Competition regulators and app developers have repeatedly raised concerns about the issue as it allows the platform holders to charge a hefty fee—between 15% to 30%—on all in-app sales. Platforms like Spotify have raised concerns about this policy as they argue it puts them at a disadvantage over competing services run by Apple and Google themselves—like Apple Music and YouTube Music—which do not have to pay such a commission. Earlier this week, South Korean lawmakers passed legislation that bans Apple and Google from enforcing the use of their payment systems. In the U.S., a group of bipartisan U.S. senators introduced a similar bill last month that would bar companies from forcing their payment system on app developers. Last year, the European Union unveiled a set of proposals that would force the likes of Apple and Google to divest parts of their business if they fail to adhere to fair competition rules.

"A woman carries shopping bags (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Return or exchange experiences of a customer can be critical to the retention of customers. By connecting customers with experts who can answer questions and give thoughtful recommendations creates a valuable experience for on-line customers that replicates the personal service an in-store associate could provide. The same personal service increases the likelihood of completing the purchase and lowers the probability of the customer making a return. For instance, 75% of costumers said they are more likely to purchase from a company that provides personalized recommendations. 54% of customers had previously made purchases based on the recommendation of a customer service professional. Gladly, Los Angeles based service platform “that treats customers like people, not tickets”. published this study that also finds that 82% of buyers make repeat purchases after brands make them feel known and most important 76% of first-time customers who had an easy or vey easy return said they would shop with that retailer again. While the study was made with on-line purchases, the results are very similar for customers who shop in-stores. It’s a simple rule: associates are front line hero is they know their merchandise and take care of the customer in a warm manner. The result is startling. 72% of customers prefer to purchase from an agent that is knowledgeable and 78% feel it is important to have a robust and varied customer experience in order to drive revenue. Companies that excelled at customer experiences drive revenues 4% to 8% higher than those of their market. One could ask why do people love shopping so much? A lot has to do with the customer service that comes with every shopping expedition, whether on-line or in-store. From the greeting “Hi, how can I help you” when you walk through the door to the helpful recommendations when you look for a new handbag, scarf or coat. There is someone physically present when you make the purchase in the store and that feeling has to find its way to on-line purchases now. The challenge is to give the same service on-line. It is important that the customer be heard and that she feels the store associate is listening to her. Another aspect for an-on-line shopping is that issues must be quickly resolved. The customer remembers courteous service. 71% of the customers said that this was an important factor. The future is an omni-channel platform where more than 19% of companies intend to add Facebook, Messenger, Apple

It is up to management to monitor activities on the call=board and encourage associates to team up for greater marketing successes.

It’s no secret L.A. has pushed its chips into the middle of the table by acquiring quarterback Matthew Stafford for Jared Goff and taking a whopping $22 million salary-cap hit to do so. They also retained edge rusher Leonard Floyd, and any defense with the ornery Aaron Donald on it is a threat. But obstacles remain, especially with L.A.’s leading rusher, Cam Akers, being lost for the season with an Achilles injury. So is this L.A.’s version of the 2020 Bucs by not stopping until hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy in February? The Rams will be heartbroken if they can’t build on last year’s 10-6 season, which ended with but one playoff win. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The biggest pickup was Stafford, the veteran quarterback with impressive stats and zero playoff wins. The Rams hope the strong-armed Stafford can stretch the field and L.A. signed wide receiver DeSean Jackson and drafted undersized wide receiver Tutu Atwell to accomplish it. Goff is gone and so is the man he received snaps from, center Brian Allen. Other defections include safety Johnny Johnson III, defensive end Michael Brockers, cornerback Troy Hill and tight end Gerald Everett. While not showing up on the roster, it’s worth noting that seven assistants coaches exited coach Sean McVay’s staff.

[+] during a game last season, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) With an offensive line which was rebuilt and running game that took a staggering blow, the Rams are best on the defensive side of the ball. That’s not a huge surprise when considering L.A. allowed the fewest points and yards last year with its league-leading unit. Donald (13.5 sacks), a three-time NFL defensive player of the year, and Floyd (a career-high 10 sacks), who shined in his walk year last season, are a pass-rushing combination few teams can match. The secondary, even with those leaving, remains solid with two-time All-Pro safety Jalen Ramsey, and cornerback Darius Williams, who had a team-high four interceptions last year.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Stafford, like any veteran quarterback with limited mobility, looks for two things to be successful and healthy: a solid running game and stout offensive line. Potentially those two areas are where the red flags flap the loudest with the Rams. Akers was emerging into a star late last year when averaging 92 rushing yards over his final seven games. But he’s gone, and Darrell Henderson III, the back Akers once beat out to be the starter, will supplant him. The Rams’ other in-house options motivated L.A. to acquire experienced running back Sony Michel from the New England Patriots late in the preseason. L.A. has known early on its offensive front needed tweaking. Blythe left for the Cleveland Browns. Left tackle Andrew Whitworth turns 40 in December and is coming off a season derailed by a knee injury. The Rams didn’t unload a boatload of draft picks, and Goff, to watch Stafford hand the ball off. McVay will open up the offense to take advantage of Stafford’s big arm, which makes it tempting to take the over on Stafford’s predicted 4,595.5 passing yards this season on draftkings.com. Stafford sped past 5,000 yards once when with the Lions in 2011, leading Detroit to a 10-6 record before being eliminated by the New Orleans Saints in the playoffs. Stafford flourishes when surrounded by weapons and an innovative coaching staff which gets the most out of his talents. The offensive front weathers age and injuries to shine, giving Stafford, and his receivers, the time he’ll need to complete the downfield routes.  The defense runs it back like last year, despite some new faces in key places. Donald vies for another defensive player of the year award and Ramsey shuts down his half of the field with quarterbacks not prone to test his ball-hawking skills. The Rams survive a tough march through the rugged NFC West, make strides in the playoffs and in a Hollywood ending, the Rams win their first Super Bowl while based in Los Angeles in front of their adoring fans at SoFi Stadium, their home during the regular season, too.

That the Rams were okay with absorbing such a haymaker to their cap reveals how much they sought Stafford and how much accountability, good or bad, will land at McVay’s feet. McVay stressed he wanted an offense built around plays that produce huge chunks. He doesn’t have patience, or motivation, to construct long, straight-ahead drives, electing instead to befuddle defenses with movement and explosive plays. How it all turns out will be indicator of McVay’s vision. This, more than any other year, is his team and whatever praise or criticism it receives will find its way to McVay. If the rebuilt front line crumbles, the running game doesn’t find a gear minus Akers, Stafford shows his best years are behind him and the defense gives ground under a new coordinator, the Rams could be anything but super in the ultra-competitive NFC West.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayparis/2021/09/02/los-angeles-rams-nfl-season-preview/,Rams Season Preview: Los Angeles Would Be Right At Home In The Super Bowl
"Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold is looking toward what he hopes will be a better future ... [+] now that he has left the New York Jets behind. (AP Photo/Jacob Kupferman) Sam Darnold came to the New York Jets three years ago with high hopes. Now he has come to the Carolina Panthers—a little more wizened, a little battered and bruised, physically and emotionally, but with the same hopes. Can Darnold make it happen this time?  Once again, that question largely will be answered by those around him. The prevailing narrative around Darnold’s ill-fated three seasons with the Jets was that he had little support, skill-position players who didn’t scare opposing defenses and linemen who could not adequately protect him.  As is often the case, some of that was fact, some fiction. In any event, Darnold now has his chance to rewrite the story.  He will be reminded quickly of his past. In their never-ending search for storylines, the NFL scheduled the Jets and second-overall pick Zach Wilson to visit Darnold and Carolina on opening day, Sept. 12. How’s that for human drama?  When it was suggested to Darnold by a reporter this week that this isn’t a normal game, he replied, “But it is. ... I’m excited to play the Jets and see what this football team can do.”  He added that he still has friends in the Jets’ organization, but admitted, “I didn’t do my job to the best of my ability and that’s really all there is to it.”  How well Darnold fares Sunday and beyond will be greatly impacted by whether running back Christian McCaffrey can regain his form after an injury-wracked 2020 season, and whether former college whiz kid Joe Brady can live up to his hype and become a feared NFL play-caller. The results last season were inconclusive, as the Panthers finished 24thin the NFL in total offense and 18th in passing offense, although some of that can be blamed on McCaffrey’s frequent absences and the lack of risk-taking by then-starter Teddy Bridgewater, now the starter in Denver.  Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The biggest addition is Darnold, of course, acquired in an April trade with the Jets for three draft picks. The Panthers then picked up his 2022 fifth-year option, which will be valued at $18.9 million, meaning they are hitching their wagon to him for at least two seasons. Bridgewater counts as $17.06 million of dead money this year, an indictment of the lucrative contract he was given last year by ex-GM Marty Hurney. Pat Elflein, who started the last six games of last season at left guard in front of Darnold with the Jets, signed a three-year contract worth $6 million in guaranteed money, per overthecap.com. Slot receiver David Moore (Seattle) got a two-year deal worth $1.25 million in guaranteed money. Tight end Dan Arnold, formerly of the Cardinals, signed for three seasons and $4.5 million guaranteed. Left tackle Cameron Erving signed for two years and $8 million guaranteed.  The loss of wide receiver Curtis Samuel, who played both in the slot and outside, is huge. He signed with the Washington Football Team for $21.5 million guaranteed. Replacing him will be difficult. On defense, edge rusher Haason Reddick got one year and $6 million guaranteed, and the Panthers are hoping former star cornerback A.J. Bouye (two years, $3.5 million guaranteed) can recapture his old form. If he can, he will be a bargain. However, he will have wait until Week 3 to start proving it, because he must sit the first two games to finish serving a six-game NFL-imposed suspension for PEDs.  Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams If McCaffrey is healthy, he is one of the most dynamic playmakers in the league. But that is a big if after he battled ankle, shoulder and quadriceps injuries last season. The Panthers and Darnold are convinced the offensive line, anchored by center Matt Paradis, will provide him much more peace of mind than the one Darnold had with the Jets. But that remains to be seen. First-round pick Jaycee Horn (South Carolina) has the makings of a shutdown cornerback, but even the ones pegged for greatness tend to struggle as rookies, so again, it’s wait and see.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Yes, Darnold didn’t have the best support with New York. But he also tended to hold onto to the ball too long and lock on to his primary reads. Darnold is terrific at improvising on the run, but can he become more efficient at reading defenses in the pocket? It's rare that a quarterback suddenly develops that ability this deep into his career, but at least he’ll have a familiar face in wide receiver Robby Anderson to throw to. He and Anderson had good chemistry with the Jets and seemed to pick up where they left off in practice.  In fact, Anderson signed a two-year extension worth $20.5 million fully guaranteed on Aug. 25, per overthecap.com, and cited being reunited with Darnold as one of the reasons. The deal also was good for Carolina, freeing up $3.2 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap. LSU rookie Terrace Marshall Jr. also should factor into the passing game. Brady's creativity should help Darnold, too.  The Panthers allowed 28 touchdown passes and had only seven interceptions last season, which is why they need top-shelf play from Bouye and Horn, in particular. Despite all the good vibes, the Panthers still reside in a tough division, the NFC South. Atlanta has a good chance to rebound with a revitalized Matt Ryan backed by the play-calling of new head coach Arthur Smith, and although New Orleans must replace Drew Brees, it still has Sean Payton at the helm. And Tom Brady still lurks. DraftKings lists Carolina as under 7.5, even money. Going under is the play. Brady, Darnold, Anderson and McCaffrey all click, as does the defense, and Matt Rhule’s decision to leave the college ranks looks better than it did last December.  Darnold is haunted by “ghosts” again—Bill Belichick and the Patriots drop by exactly one week after Halloween, the defense still can’t force enough turnovers, and the offense again stalls in the red zone.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jppelzman/2021/09/02/carolina-panthers-nfl-season-preview/,Carolina Panthers Season Preview: Can Sam Darnold Turn His Career Around?
"CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - AUGUST 14: Justin Fields #1 of the Chicago Bears passes against the Miami ... [+] Dolphins during a preseason game at Soldier Field on August 14, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) The Chicago Bears won’t get a second chance to draft Patrick Mahomes but no longer can blame Mitchell Trubisky for every disappointment. This is the Justin Fields era at Soldier Field, even if Andy Dalton will be the starting quarterback when Chicago faces the Rams in the season opener.  The goal for head coach Matt Nagy and embattled general manager Ryan Pace is getting back to the playoffs, which is asking a lot for a team that has had one winning season since firing Lovie Smith after a ten-win season in 2012. The key is improving an offense that was 22nd in scoring last season, and an injury to rookie left tackle Teven Jenkins adds to doubt about a patchwork offensive line. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Looking to address questions about their offense, the Bears signed Dalton to a one-year contract while trading up in the draft to snag Fields as their long-term quarterback. They also overhauled an offensive line that had gotten old, dropping Bobby Massie and Charles Leno for salary cap reasons and spending draft capital on Oklahoma State’s Jenkins. They signed Elijah Wilkinson as a tackle option and are rolling the dice on ancient tackle Jason Peters as a replacement for Jenkins, who could miss the season after back surgery. Wide receiver Anthony Miller was traded to Houston.  Wide receivers Marquise Goodwin and Damiere Byrd were added as targets for Dalton and Fields. Along with Massie and Leno, cornerback Kyle Fuller was a salary-cap casualty. The Bears signed free agent Desmond Trufant to add depth at cornerback, where 2020 draft picks Jaylon Johnson and Kindle Vildor will be tested as young starters, but released Trufant after he missed most of training camp. The Bears lost defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris to Jacksonville in free agency. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams As they have seemingly since the invention of the wheel, the Bears will count on their defense to overcome questions about their offense. The unit led by Khalil Mack, Roquan Smith and Akiem Hicks held opponents to 345 yards per game last season, the 11th best total in the league. It needs to make more big plays this season after ranking 17th in sacks and 25th in takeaways last season. Allen Robinson, who received a franchise tag after a 102-catch season, and running back David Montgomery remain the headliners in an offense that could be a pleasant surprise if the quarterbacks and offensive line deliver. Second-year receiver Darnell Mooney provides some explosiveness and has shown sure hands, keeping defenses from loading up to stop Robinson.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams How long will Pace and Nagy ride Dalton’s experience over Fields’ potential? Fields has been a standout performer on the practice field and in preseason games. His ability to extend plays and pick up first downs with his feet will be essential if the offensive line doesn’t protect Dalton, who last seen was running for his life with the Cowboys. Some metrics say Dalton played worse than Trubisky last year.  Will Byrd and Goodwin respond to opportunities to be targeted more often in a relatively thin group of wide receivers? Along with the continued emergence of second-year tight end Cole Kmet, this would lessen the load on Robinson and Mooney, making life easier for the quarterbacks. The offensive line must step up to give Dalton and Fields a chance. While Cody Whitehair and the interior linemen appear solid the tackle position looks especially shaky. Jenkins could return late in the season but he’s not exactly a known commodity himself.  Can the defensive front put consistent pressure on quarterbacks to keep opponents from exposing the inexperience of Vildor and, to a lesser degree, Johnson? It’s hard to know what to expect from nose tackle Eddie Goldman, who opted out of the 2020 season and then missed a big chunk of training camp on the COVID-19 list.  Mooney, over 4.5 receiving touchdowns, -115 (Betonline). It takes $115 dollars to win $100 but this seems like an easy one to cover if Mooney avoids injury. He’ll be the secondary target for Bears quarterbacks behind Robinson and the Bears figure to play catch up frequently against Green Bay, Minnesota and other high-powered offenses on their schedule.  Dalton plays well enough to keep the Bears around .500 before Pace and Nagy hand the reins to Fields, most likely in the second quarter of the season. The 39-year-old Peters plays well enough for the offensive line to improve from last season, giving the offense a chance to succeed. Fields, Montgomery, Robinson and Mooney stay healthy and produce well enough to win games against the Packers and Vikings, sending the Bears to the postseason. Along the way, Fields plays like one of the NFL’s top young quarterbacks while Robinson signs the long-term contract extension he’s sought unsuccessfully the last two years.  The under-financed offensive line is too big of a weakness for the team to overcome without Jenkins. A poor first half leads to the second half of the season being all about Fields’ development and the likely departure of Robinson after the season. Pace is relieved of his job, and Nagy is put in the uncomfortable position of coaching for a team executive who did not hire him.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/philrogers/2021/09/02/chicago-bears-nfl-season-preview/,"Chicago Bears Season Preview: Can Justin Fields Start A Turnaround, Whenever He Gets His Chance?"
"Atlanta first-year head coach Arthur Smith hopes to lead the Falcons back to respectability this ... [+] season. The Atlanta Falcons hired general manager Terry Fontenot and head coach Arthur Smith this offseason to breathe new life into the franchise. Former general manager Thomas Dimitroff (2008-20) and ex-coach Dan Quinn (2015-20) led the Falcons to the Super Bowl in 2016. Atlanta is just 28-36 since then, though, prompting changes. One spot the Falcons didn’t change — to the surprise of many — was at quarterback. Atlanta had the No. 4 pick in April’s draft, but passed on a quarterback and opted to stay with veteran Matt Ryan. The Falcons were 16th in scoring offense last year but ranked No. 29 in total defense and finished 4-12 overall. If both sides can make modest gains, Atlanta could make a run toward a .500 season. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Falcons’ biggest addition figures to be rookie tight end Kyle Pitts, selected with the fourth overall pick in April’s draft. Pitts (6-6, 246) is widely regarded as one of the top tight end prospects in NFL history and could take the offense from good to great. Running back Mike Davis, who stepped in for the injured Christian McCaffrey in Carolina last year, had a solid season and came over in free agency. Atlanta also tried addressing its moribund defense in free agency with mid-level veterans such as safeties Erik Harris (Las Vegas) and Duron Harmon (Detroit), linebackers Brandon Copeland (New England) and Barkevious Mingo (Chicago) and cornerback Fabian Moreau. The Falcons traded Julio Jones and a 2023 sixth-round pick to the Tennessee Titans for a 2022 second-round pick and a fourth in 2023. While Jones is 32 and not the player he once was, he went to seven Pro Bowls and holds the franchise record for receptions (848) and receiving yards (12,896). Veteran center Alex Mack, one of the better players at his position for more than a decade, also left in free agency. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Falcons ranked fifth in the NFL and first in the NFC last year in passing offense. And while losing Jones is a tough blow, Pitts could be a star quickly and Calvin Ridley seems ready to take over as the No. 1 receiver. Matt Ryan is 36 and not the player he was when he was winning MVP honors in 2016. Ryan remains among the top 12 quarterbacks in football, though, and can still sling it with the best. The secondary — particularly at safety — should be improved. Of course, there’s nowhere to go but up. Atlanta ranked last in the NFL in passing defense last year (293.6). The Falcons were active in free agency, though, then drafted highly-regarded safety Richie Grant in the second round. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams This starts with the Falcons’ pass rush, or lack thereof. Atlanta managed just 29 sacks last year despite having gifted defenders such as Dante Fowler Jr., Grady Jarrett and Keanu Neal in its front seven. The Falcons ranked just 27th in the NFL in rushing offense last year (95.8). Atlanta hopes Davis is the answer, but he’s on his fifth team and has a career rushing average of just 3.7 yards per carry. The offensive line has potential to be improved. Much of that will hinge, though, on if Matt Hennessy can adequately replace Mack at center. Matt Ryan Passing Yards: 4,450.5 Over -115, Under -115 Ryan has thrown for more than 4450.5 yards in eight of the last nine seasons, averaging 4,614.3 in that time. Now, Ryan gets a 17th game to work with in a league where passing numbers rise every season. While injury risk always makes it dicey to take the over with older players, Ryan has been remarkably durable. He’s missed just three games in his 13-year career and only one since 2010. As long as Ryan stays healthy, Atlanta’s suspect defense and the Falcons’ solid array of pass catchers will help him exceed 4,450 passing yards. Bet: Over, -115 Arthur Smith, who was Tennessee’s offensive coordinator the last two years, is widely regarded as one of the top offensive minds in the game. Dean Pees, who’s had tremendous success as the defensive coordinator in New England and Baltimore, came out of retirement to run the defense for Smith. There’s talent on the roster and a fourth-place schedule to work with. And if these two can push the right buttons, Atlanta could be markedly improved. The Falcons blew a 28-3 lead to New England in the 2016 Super Bowl, and have become notorious for wasting big leads ever since. The Falcons became the first team in league history to blow leads of 15-plus points in the fourth quarter of two different games last year. Atlanta also lost seven games by 7 points or fewer last season. If the Falcons can’t figure out a way to win its share of nail-biters, they’ll remain among the league’s bottom feeders for at least another year.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/02/atlanta-falcons-nfl-season-preview/,"Atlanta Falcons Season Preview: Matt Ryan Remains In Place, But His Team Is Ready To Start Over"
"Dalvin Cook has the skill and athleticism to lead the Vikings to a memorable 2021 season. (Photo by ... [+] Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) The Vikings have followed a clear pattern during Mike Zimmer’s first seven years as head coach. They have made the playoffs on an every-other-year basis, and since they failed to get there last year with a 7-9 record, a good case can be made that they will return to the postseason in 2021. The Vikings have talented skill position players to drive the offense, and the blockers up front should be somewhat better than last year. The defense was basically awful last year – Zimmer’s own assessment – but that unit will see superstar pass rusher Danielle Hunter return to the lineup and has added several key players.  Significant improvement may be the result, but there is a potential problem in the team’s lack of overall depth. Over a 17-game season, this could prove fatal. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Vikings did not have Hunter last year as a result of disc surgery, but he returns at full strength this season. Hunter had 14.5 sacks in both 2018 and 2019, and there’s no reason he can’t meet or exceed those numbers. Last season, the Vikings got pushed around on defense, and the middle of the line was vulnerable. The addition of defensive tackles Dalvin Tomlinson and Michael Pierce will give the team much greater resistance against the interior run. The secondary has been an issue for at least the last two seasons, and CB Patrick Peterson has the skill and experience to provide an upgrade.  General manager Rick Spielman let dependable tight end Kyle Rudolph leave for the New York Giants through free agency, but he may regret that since Irv Smith Jr. has a meniscus issue and faces surgery. The Vikings acquired Chris Herndon in a trade with the Jets, and that’s a solid last-minute addition. Herndon caught 31-of-45 targets last year for 287 yards and 3 touchdowns. Left tackle Riley Reiff will line up for the Cincinnati Bengals this season, while safety Anthony Harris signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. Both were disappointing in 2020 and are not likely to be missed. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Vikings appear to be in great shape among their front-line skill position players. Running back Dalvin Cook is one of the best players at his position in the league, and he has game-changing breakaway ability because of his speed and moves. In addition to his top running instincts, Cook is a threat as a receiver, and opponents must make stopping him their priority. The 1-2 punch of Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen at the wide receiver spot is another huge plus. Jefferson had 1,400 receiving yards as a rookie, while Thielen runs pristine pass patterns and has brilliant hands. Quarterback Kirk Cousins regularly puts up dominating stats and it would not surprise if he completed 70 percent of his passes or better. However, he still has to show he can compete well in the biggest moments against top opposition. Hunter is healthy, and he is also happy after signing a five-year, $72 million extension. The ability of Tomlinson and Pierce to shut down the interior run should help build confidence in the defensive unit. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Offensive line was a big issue last year, and while there should be some improvement, it is hardly a strength. The Vikings drafted Christian Darrisaw with their first-round selection with the idea that he would play left tackle. He has been troubled by a groin injury this summer and Rashod Hill is slated to play that position as Darrisaw recovers. The secondary should be better than it was the last two seasons, but that’s a long way from being a positive. Peterson represents an upgrade and safety Harrison Smith is one of the best in the business, but this unit is still vulnerable. Special teams were disastrous last year, and there are questions this year as well. Greg Joseph takes over as placekicker, and he is anything but a sure thing when he steps on the field. The Vikings were hopeful that former Lion Ameer Abdullah would give the return game a lift, but he did not survive training camp and was cut. In addition to these positional problems, the Vikings don’t have the requisite depth to put up with injuries. Running back Alexander Mattison is a decent backup to Cook, but injuries at quarterback, wide receiver, defensive end and safety could be disastrous. Cook is almost certainly the Vikings’ best offensive player. When the Vikings win, Cook almost always plays a key role for them, and he has improved significantly in each of his four seasons in the NFL. After rushing for 354 yards as a rookie in 2017, he has followed that up with rushing totals of 615 yards, 1,135 yards and 1,557 yards the next three seasons. If he improves by the same rate in 2021, a 2,000-yard season could be at hand. If that’s the case, Cook is likely to be in the race for big-time honors at the end of the season. An MVP season could result in a huge payoff for Cook’s backers. A $100 bet will return $7,500 with FanDuel and $8,000 with PointsBet. A $100 bet on Cook winning offensive player of the year will result in a $1,600 payoff (PointsBet), while leading the league in rushing will deliver $600 to Cook bettors (FanDuel). If Cook can stay healthy, the belief here is that he leads the league in rushing and makes a run at Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes for offensive player of the year and MVP. The Vikings start out hot and the defense shows explosive improvement. Instead of getting overwhelmed physically, the Vikings punish opponents with their defense and their skill position stars show out. They battle the Green Bay Packers for the division title and emerge with a 13-4 record and win the crown. Injuries hit early and the unproven backups have to play regularly. The team may be somewhat competitive most weeks, but they close the year in third place in the NFC North with an 8-9 record.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevesilverman/2021/09/02/minnesota-vikings-nfl-season-preview/,"Minnesota Vikings Season Preview: Big-Time Promise, But Depth Issues Could Be Disastrous"
"New Los Angeles Chargers head coach Brandon Staley, right, claps next to quarterback Justin Herbert ... [+] before a preseason game. Herbert looks to build on his record-setting rookie season by getting the Chargers to the playoffs. (AP Photo/Ringo Chiu ) The Los Angeles Chargers believe they have turned the corner, set to enjoy a season that reveals their talented roster while they win over more Southern California fans. The Chargers poached Brandon Staley, the coordinator of the NFL’s top defense with the Los Angeles Rams last year, to be their head coach. The Chargers were heady in drafting Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert last year and are eager to see him build on a campaign in which he set numerous NFL rookie passing records. The defense returns a fit All-Pro safety in Derwin James Jr. and a three-time Pro Bowler in defensive end Joey Bosa, who’s revved to pester quarterbacks again. Hopes are high that the Chargers, who won their final four games in last year’s 7-9 campaign, will do more than just play second fiddle to their SoFi Stadium landlord, the Los Angeles Rams. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams One can’t turn a blind eye to the team’s biggest move: drafting left tackle Rashawn Slater to protect Herbert’s blindside. His athletic skill-set will allow him to also pull on trap plays and spring the Chargers’ backs for potential big games. General manager Tom Telesco didn’t just address left tackle as only one starter, right tackle Bryan Bulaga, is returning. Pro Bowl center Corey Linsley and guards, Matt Feiler and Oday Aboushi, give the line an entirely different look. Tight end Jared Cook was signed, which eases the loss of tight ends Hunter Henry and Virgil Green — receiving-wise, at least. Defensive end Melvin Ingram left as a free agent, which will allow blocking assignments to focus more on Bosa.

[+] and wide receiver Mike Williams (81) celebrate Allen's touchdown last season against the New York Jets. (AP Photo/Kyusung Gong) The Chargers will revolve around Herbert, the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, which made the hiring of Staley, with his defensive bent, a bit of a surprise. But Staley, a quarterback in college, is well-versed in stopping offenses and he seems to have the knowledge for them to find the next level. With Herbert having a season under his belt, and maybe more importantly, a year of offseason workouts, he’s expected to build on last year’s numbers when he threw for 31 touchdowns and more than 4,300 yards. Herbert will aim at an impressive list of receivers, which include Pro Bowler Keenan Allen, lanky Mike Williams and sure-handed running back Austin Ekeler. The defense is potentially stout as well. But Telesco was determined to address the front line, which he did, in the expectation that the offense will more than carry its load.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams This isn’t Telesco’s first go-ahead in fixing the offense line and his past results aren’t very encouraging. Can these five new players quickly mesh into a productive unit, especially when considering Slater is a rookie left tackle? At least Bulaga is familiar with Linsley, as they played on the same line for six seasons when with the Green Bay Packers. On paper, it appears the other linemen will fall in line quickly. But if Slater is overwhelmed — remember the Chargers lost two solid blocking tight ends in Hunter and Green — and the unfamiliarity between the players reveals itself, the new kids on the block might not better than the last bunch. Rookie Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. (26) celebrates after intercepting a pass ... [+] during a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) Cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. played big in the biggest games at Florida State. With the Chargers thin on cornerbacks opposite starter Mike Davis, Samuel could get chances to contribute early and often. Samuel is listed at +3500 to be named as the defensive rookie of the year at draftkings.com. There’s value in that wager when digging deep on the circumstances. With James back at safety and an experienced Davis on the other side of Samuel, quarterbacks will invariably test the rookie to try and stay clear of his teammates. With Bosa applying pressure to force the ball to come out quickly, Samuel could be in position to shine and compile statistics that get him in the rookie defensive player of the year conversation. Staley proves to be the Chargers’ version of the Los Angeles Rams’ Sean McVay. Staley shares many of the same qualities with McVay when looking at his youthful energy, innovative approach and communication skills with his players and staff. If Herbert flourishes, he might not only show to be the best quarterback in L.A. — sorry, Matthew Stafford — but in the entire league. Playing behind an improved line, Herbert delivers the star power the Chargers thirst for in the entertainment capital of the world. The Chargers went 7-9 last year and have a ton of upside, but among their downsides is playing the AFC West with the Kansas City Chiefs. If Herbert can take the next step in what appears to be a dynamite career, just maybe the Chargers make the Chiefs sweat over winning their sixth straight division title. As with the two gentlemen hired before him who had never been head coaches at any level, Mike McCoy and Anthony Lynn, maybe the job is too big for Staley. If the Chargers are slow in absorbing his schemes — which can be complicated — and Slater’s learning curve is steep, the Chargers could struggle. The injury bug always seems to bite the Chargers, and if that’s true again with key players, their depth isn’t rock solid.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayparis/2021/09/02/los-angeles-chargers-nfl-season-preview/,Los Angeles Chargers Season Preview: No Ducking Expectations In Justin Herbert’s Second Year
"The San Francisco 49ers 2021 season will be defined by the quarterback position (AP Photo/D. Ross ... [+] Cameron) The San Francisco 49ers enter the 2021 NFL season with heightened expectations after an injury-plagued 2020 campaign. With the 49ers seemingly healthy, there’s every reason to believe that they are going to be playoff contenders come September.  With that said, the results will depend on the team’s quarterbacks. Jimmy Garoppolo faced a fierce training camp battle from rookie No. 3 pick Trey Lance for the starting job. Even with Garoppolo installed as QB1, there’s a short leash on the veteran signal caller. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams By default, we have to include Pro Bowl pass-rushers Nick Bosa and Dee Ford as additions to this team. They played in a combined three games last season and appear to be 100% healthy. Given how dominant this unit was with both in the mix during San Francisco’s Super Bowl season back in 2019, this is no small thing.  In a precarious cap situation, general manager John Lynch and Co. did well to add talent during free agency. Pro Bowl center Alex Mack joins recently re-signed left tackle Trent Williams to form an elite pairing. Rookie running backs Trey Sermon and Elijah Mitchell add to an already deep group at that position. Of course, the biggest offseason move was to trade up for Trey Lance. I’ll have a lot more on that below.  In terms of free-agent departures, the 49ers are left relatively thin at cornerback after Ahkello Witherspoon signed with the division-rival Seattle Seahawks and with Richard Sherman still a free agent. I am also a little concerned over the loss of wide receiver Kendrick Bourne. That also leaves depth issues at wide receiver.  Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The San Francisco 49ers defensive line is going to be a force in 2021. (AP Phto/Josie Lepe) If healthy, the 49ers are absolutely loaded a long the defensive line. In addition to returning Bosa and Ford, San Francisco added key underrated free agents such as Zach Kerr, Arden Key and Maurice Hurst. This doesn’t even include stud youngster Javon Kinlaw as well as holdovers Arik Armstead, D.J. Jones, Jordan Willis and Kevin Givens. Realistically, the 49ers go 10 deep.  Just recently signed to a massive contract extension, All-Pro Fred Warner returns as the face of the 49ers’ linebacker group. He’s joined by impressive third-year pro Dre Greenlaw to form an elite pairing. Depending on where he lines up, free-agent signing Samson Ebukam could also play a huge role here. He has elite athletic ability and is a perfect scheme fit.  Offensively, the 49ers’ biggest strength has to be at running back. Raheem Mostert remains a threat to take it the distance on every touch. Third-round pick Trey Sermon just has the “it” factor.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams To take a phrase from James Carville, “it’s the quarterback position, stupid.” Realistically, the 49ers’ success will depend heavily on what we see under center in a revamped quarterback room that returns just one player (Jimmy Garoppolo) from last season.  Once San Francisco dealt away two future first-round picks and change to move up from the 12th pick to No. 3 overall, it became apparent that the team was targeting a quarterback. Small-school product Trey Lance form North Dakota State ended up being the choice. As talented as any quarterback in the 2021 NFL Draft class, concerns immediately arose over Lance’s perceived raw skill-set and the fact that he didn’t play during the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  What we saw from Lance during training camp and the preseason changed this dramatically. He vastly outplayed Garoppolo at nearly every turn, registering four touchdowns against one interception.  While Garoppolo will get the Week 1 start against the Detroit Lions, expect his leash to be incredibly short. The question then becomes whether Lance’s preseason success will translate to actual meaningful games. He’s just 21 years old and remains pretty darn raw. That could make or break the 49ers’ championship hopes in 2021.  Trey Lance as NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Even with Garoppolo set to start Week 1, there’s a darn good chance that Lance will see action early on. Whether it’s rotating snaps with Garoppolo or taking over for the veteran, I am expecting to see a lot from the rookie No. 3 pick.  When looking at other first-year signal callers, it’s hard to imagine another quarterback being in a better position. Trevor Lawrence’s Jacksonville Jaguars have a ton of issues on offense. The New York Jets and Zach Wilson are in complete rebuild mode. Even after earning the New England Patriots’ starting job, Mac Jones doesn’t have a ton to work with on offense.  Kyle Shanahan and the San Francisco 49ers expect to compete in 2021. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) Lance takes over as the starter early in the season and adds a new dimension to head coach Kyle Shanahan’s offense. We saw it during the preseason. San Francisco’s offense is just different with him under center. The threat to run coupled with the 49ers’ skill-position players could make for a dynamic offense — even if Lance has some struggles.  This scenario would include San Francisco’s now-healthy defense returning to 2019 form and becoming a top-five unit. In all, this could lead to renewed Super Bowl contention for the 49ers.  Garoppolo goes down to injury and Lance proves that his “project” title leading up to the 2021 NFL Draft was much more than a narrative. That’s the absolute worst-case scenario from a player personnel standpoint. But as we saw with the 49ers last season, injuries could take a toll. They finished up the 2020 campaign with the most cash on injured reserve. In today’s NFL salary-cap era, that’s not a recipe for success.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2021/09/02/san-francisco-49ers-nfl-season-preview/,San Francisco 49ers Season Preview: It’s All About Quarterback Heading Into 2021
"WESTFIELD, IN - AUGUST 18: Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor (28) runs through a drill ... [+] during the Indianapolis Colts training camp practice on August 18, 2021 at Grand Park Sports Complex in Westfield, IN. (Photo by Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) The Indianapolis Colts are once again entering an important season to potentially climb into the elite tier of the AFC. With a new starting quarterback for the fourth season in a row, how will Indianapolis adjust with Carson Wentz under center? With the team expected to battle with the Tennessee Titans for the AFC South crown in 2021-22, how will the Colts’ near NFL low in vaccination rate impact their season? Although the Colts’ roster is still young, they have an ascending core ready to win right now as their Super Bowl window begins to open up. With GM Chris Ballard and head coach Frank Reich recently signing multi-year extensions, no seats will be hot in Indy. However, the pressure is on for their new quarterback to hit the ground running following a disastrous year with the Philadelphia Eagles. Really, a lot of the Colts’ potential issues could revolve around off the field situations as Covid-19 could play a massive role. Indianapolis’ lack of teamwide vaccinations has already started to cause an impact for Week 1 preparation with multiple starters stuck in health and safety protocols. If all goes well, this is a true playoff contender. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams As mentioned, bringing aboard Wentz as their new starting quarterback has immense upside. However, as we saw last season, the downside is very real. Which version of Wentz will show up? If the Colts get the consistent version who had a near-MVP season under Reich’s tutelage in 2017, Indianapolis has the makings of a double-digit win team. Another integral piece added to the Colts was their top draft pick, Michigan pass rusher Kwity Paye. Already making a dominant impact in training camp and preseason, Paye playing alongside DeForest Buckner has some dynamic potential to be unstoppable. As far as subtractions go, the Colts didn’t really have much outside of two retirements: quarterback Philip Rivers and left tackle Anthony Castonzo. Losing two key pieces to the offense simultaneously was tough, but rolling the dice on Wentz and Eric Fisher could bring an even higher ceiling. Also, defensive end Denico Autry signed with division rival Tennessee, but former second-round pick Tyquan Lewis is expected to play well in his place. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The way Ballard dreamed of is how the Colts’ strengths set up inside the trenches. Having arguably the best offensive and defensive line combination in the NFL, especially if Paye becomes a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate as expected, the Colts can dominate games at the line of scrimmage. Jonathan Taylor is poised for a monster sophomore campaign, potentially 2,000 scrimmage yards being within reach. Taylor will be the bellcow of the Colts’ offense, however ascending young playmakers like Michael Pittman Jr. and Parris Campbell figure to play huge roles in the offense. Overall, the trenches and the run game is where Indianapolis will win their games. However, will they be able to make it into playoff football, where they are built to thrive? Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Honestly, there’s not much on this roster in terms of question marks. With a strong nucleus already in place, the biggest question mark revolves around Wentz. If Wentz is unable to bounce-back reuniting with Reich, the Colts are doomed for an under .500 season. If he can at least be an average quarterback, Indianapolis’ well-balanced roster can carry Wentz to a double-digit win campaign. Outside of Wentz, the only other real question revolves around the second starter at boundary cornerback. Xavier Rhodes had a resurgent season in Indianapolis’ zone-heavy scheme. Kenny Moore is one of the most underrated defensive backs in the NFL. Julian Blackmon is already an elite safety. However, who will take the reins at CB2? 2019 second-round pick Rock Ya-Sin has been up-and-down throughout his career, and they will need to hope he settles in during an ever-important Year 3 for the former Temple Owl. I’m very bullish on Taylor becoming a superstar running back. On DraftKings, Taylor ranks No. 4 in best odds to lead the NFL in rushing this season at +900 behind Derrick Henry, Dalvin Cook and Nick Chubb. With those tasty odds where you can win $200 on a $20 bet for Taylor, take the money and run here. Taylor is poised for over 300 touches in the Colts’ offense this season, especially early on in a tough schedule where Wentz will slowly adjust to a new system. Taylor ranked second behind Henry in rushing yards over the second half of last season as a rookie. In Year 2, Taylor has all the ingredients in place to take another monster leap forward as one of the best young stars in the NFL. If the Colts survive their early-season gauntlet — home against the Seattle Seahawks and the Los Angeles Rams and then on the road against the Tennessee Titans, the Miami Dolphins and the Baltimore Ravens — they really could be a team that exceeds the 10-plus win mark. If everything breaks perfectly for the Colts, their ceiling is likely a 12-5 or 11-6 team who eventually wins the AFC South. The worst-case scenario for the Colts could easily unfold, especially if they get off to a slow start and Wentz underperforms. Also, we can’t rule out the Colts’ unvaccinated rate to having an impact later on if minds aren to changed in their locker room soon enough. If everything goes wrong for the Colts, there’s real potential to be a 7-10 team. If they fail to secure early season momentum, it could be a very long season in Indianapolis for all the wrong reasons.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/evansidery/2021/09/02/indianapolis-colts-nfl-season-preview/,Indianapolis Colts Season Preview: A Loaded Roster With So Many Questions

Vera Bradley Incorporated reported its second quarter (Q2) sales up 11.6% compared to last year. The company operates two unique lifestyle brands under the names of Vera Bradley and Pura Vida with both brands having a devoted and loyal customer base across multiple generations. Vera Bradely is a lifestyle brand of quilted-cotton luggage, handbags, and accessories and Pura Vida is a digital native brand of jewelry and accessories. The company has its own stores and sells online while also distributing products through other retailers.  The company closed many of its stores in 2020 because of the pandemic, but customer loyalty continued to grow with sales reaching $147 million for Q2 — 23% over the 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Rob Wallstrom, CEO of Vera Bradley, Inc., stated, “We posted a consolidated year-over-year second quarter revenue increase of nearly 12%.” However, the positive results were achieved despite major issues with the supply chain that continue to plague the retailer and the industry as a whole.     CEO Rob Wallstrom stated in the Q2 earnings call, ""Our team is focused, our balance sheet is solid, ... [+] our brands are strong, and we are positioned for long-term growth”  Wallstrom discussed the continued issues with the supply chain that have plagued the retailer and the industry. Higher tariff and freight costs have impacted transportation expenses which impact the gross margin. Additionally,  port congestion and factory closings due to COVID have slowed product delivery.  Wallstrom said in the earnings call, “We did not anticipate having continued supply chain issues going into the second quarter and we did not anticipate having to use as much air shipping.” The company has had to ship more products by air as opposed to by sea, in order to get them into stores in a timely manner. Air shipments are more costly than sea shipments which inflates the cost of goods. Wallstrom added, “We had to make decisions about which products to ship by air versus by sea and it is a very complex process.” While the average unit retail (the amount spent per customer) is up over last year, the company is having internal conversations about raising prices on some products to offset the increase in the cost of goods. Wallstrom stated, “We are taking a surgical approach in understanding which products will warrant price increases.” The gross margin has slipped in Q2 of this year from both 2020 and 2019 levels, coming in at 54.6%. The new Apple IOS update has changed privacy and app tracking data which has negatively impacted digital native brand Pura Vida. Marketing for the Pura Vida brand has previously been highly successful using Facebook and Instagram advertising and consistently ranks as the number-one engaged brand in the jewelry category on Instagram. Based on the Apple update which limits customer app tracking, Pura Vida is looking to expand its marketing initiatives across more platforms including Google SEO, email marketing, and other social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Additionally, the company discussed store expansion plans for the Pura Vida brand which will provide better customer data and the ability to optimize analytics to drive loyalty.

"Houston Texans season preview: Quarterback Tyrod Taylor is facing an uphill climb. (AP Photo/Justin ... [+] Rex) Deshaun Watson was the story surrounding the Houston Texans all off-season. The three-time Pro Bowler and reigning NFL passing yards leader requested a trade early in the spring. Since then, he’s been accused of sexual assault and/or sexual misconduct by north of 20 women. (He has repeatedly denied the accusations.) Heading into Week 1 against the division-rival Jacksonville Jaguars, Watson remains on the Texans’ 53-man roster. However, the team has plans to keep him inactive as the legal situation plays out.  From an on-field standpoint, these Texans can easily be considered the least-talented team in the NFL. First-year head coach David Culley has a lot of work to do in order to make this team competitive on a weekly basis. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Houston Texans season preview: running back Phillip Lindsay. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith) Of the Texans’ initial 53-man roster to open the season, there are 16 new players currently under one-year contracts. New general manager Nick Caserio used the limited resources he had at his disposal to sign multiple veteran free agents and pull off an unusually large number of trades.  Former Pro Bowl quarterback Tyrod Taylor takes over under center. He’ll be joined in the backfield by veterans Mark Ingram, Phillip Lindsay and Rex Burkhead — all of whom spearhead a newly-formed rushing attack. Despite some turnover on defense, that’s the name of the game for Houston.  Obviously, the focus here is going to be on the absence of Deshaun Watson. However, losing wide receives Will Fuller, Randall Cobb and Keke Coutee is also going to hurt. That trio combined for 1,720 receiving yards a season ago. Rookie third-round pick Nico Collins will be tasked with stepping up in their stead.  Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Unfortunately, it’s really hard to find one real strength on this Texans roster. If Watson were available, that would obviously be a different situation. Houston will boast one of the worst records in the NFL this coming season.  The positive news? A newly-formed rushing attack could at least keep the Texans competitive at times throughout the season. In addition to the three backs mentioned above, the Texans return leading rusher David Johnson. All four of these veterans bring something different to the table. If they can help take the burden off Taylor and Houston’s passing game, this team could surprise with some competitive games in 2021.  Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams I honestly don’t know where to start here. Houston’s success in the past has obviously been predicated on Watson. Now, this team is set to rely on a quarterback in Tyrod Taylor who is years removed from being starter-caliber. His backup is a project in that of rookie third-round pick Davis Mills.  If this weren’t bad enough, Houston’s current receivers outside of Brandin Cooks combined for 93 receptions a season ago. If I had to pick, it’s the passing game that boasts the biggest questions marks in Houston this coming season. But it’s a long list.  New head coach David Culley and the Houston Texans are in for a long season. (AP Photo/Eric ...

Looking at this team’s roster and the drama we’ve seen unfold, it’s hard to imagine the Texans beating the mark.  Eight of Houston’s 17 games come against teams that made the playoffs a season ago. Of the nine matchups against non-playoff teams, six come against vastly improved squads in that of the New England Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, Los Angeles Chargers and San Francisco 49ers. Is there any way that the Texans even come close to winning even one of these outings? If not, the higher-water mark is three victories.  All eyes are on Deshaun Watson as the Houston Texans open the 2021 NFL season. (AP Photo/Justin Rex) Deshaun Watson is cleared of wrongdoing in the civil cases brought against him. The Houston Police Department refuses to press criminal charges with the NFL settling for a minimal suspension.  In no way does this mean Watson will ever play in a Texans uniform again. Rather, it would give Houston’s brass the ability to get a ton of compensation for the star 25-year-old quarterback. In turn, Davis Mills takes over for Taylor under center and somehow proves in less than one season he’s a starter-caliber quarterback in the NFL. Right now, Houston’s future success is not about the 2021 campaign on the gridiron. It’s about what we see happen behind the scenes.  Haven’t we already seen it at this point? Shockingly, things could take an even worst turn for the Texans during the 2021 season. David Culley proves to be in over his head as a first-year head coach.  The Watson situation is not settled off the field. Boasting a lack of any competitive ability on the field, veterans start to lose interest. In the mean time, youngsters remaining on Houston’s roster don’t take the next step.

"Dak Prescott, fresh off his injury, is prepared to lead the Cowboys to the postseason in 2021. The expectations for the Dallas Cowboys’ 2021 season were set almost as soon as star quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a season-ending injury in Week 5 of last season. As their offensive momentum came to a halt and new head coach Mike McCarthy was forced to navigate a regular season that saw a rotating cast of quarterbacks under center, attention in Dallas had already shifted to the 2021 campaign. For the first time since 2018, Prescott has multiyear security after signing a four-year, $160 million contract extension this past off-season. With that comfort comes the pressure of winning. The Cowboys have not advanced past the divisional round of the playoffs since winning the Super Bowl in 1995. It’s a drought that owner Jerry Jones wants to see end, and a responsibility that falls on Prescott’s shoulders as the Cowboys look to move on from their 6-10 record of 2020 and get back on the winning track. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Beyond signing Prescott to an extension, most of the Cowboys’ offseason moves came on the defensive side of the ball - and for good reason. Dallas fielded a historically bad defense last season, finishing 28th in the league in points allowed per game with 29.6 and 31st in rushing yards allowed per game with 158.8. The major defensive change came at the administrative level as the Cowboys hired former Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn as the team’s new defensive coordinator. Though Quinn was not successful at the helm in Atlanta, he did help lead the Falcons alongside Kyle Shanahan to the Super Bowl in 2016. Quinn’s influence on the defense was evident in the 2021 NFL Draft when the Cowboys drafted linebacker Micah Parsons out of Penn State at No. 10 overall. Selecting CB Kelvin Joseph in the second round and signing safety Keanu Neal in free agency were also among the major defensive moves made by the Cowboys this offseason. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Cowboys focused less of their energy on the offensive side of the ball this offseason because it is their biggest strength, beginning with Prescott at quarterback and extending to Ezekiel Elliott in the backfield and CeeDee Lamb and Amari Cooper on the edges. Lamb almost reached the century mark in his rookie campaign, recording 935 yards on 74 receptions and five touchdowns while Cooper has compiled two straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards. Before suffering his season-ending ankle injury in Week 5 of last season, Prescott was well ahead of pace to breaking the NFL’s single-season passing yardage record. He threw for 1,856 yards last season for an all-time NFL record average of 371.2 yards per game. If Prescott picks up where he left off, the Cowboys offense is poised for a strong comeback season. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams While Dallas promises to be dominant on offense, the defensive secondary looks less reliable. The Cowboys drafted two cornerbacks in the 2021 NFL Draft in Joseph and Nashon Wright to add depth. Secondary was a major position group of need heading into this offseason but it remains to be seen how much value these two rookies will add in their freshmen campaigns.  Trevon Diggs, who was drafted in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft, improved as the season progressed but fell slightly short of expectations. His 651 receiving yards allowed ranked 21st-most among all cornerbacks despite him playing just 12 games, according to Pro Football Focus. Newcomers Joseph and Wright will likely compete against veteran Anthony Brown for a starting role while free safety remains a question mark as some combination of Jayron Kearse, Damontae Kazee and Darian Thompson will compete for the role. According to DraftKings, the Cowboys are favored to win the NFC East with odds of +130. Dallas was favored to win the division heading into last season and will begin the 2021 season with the same expectations. The Cowboys have not missed the playoffs for three or more consecutive seasons since a four-year drought between 2010-2013. The Cowboys are fielding the strongest offense in the NFC East this season. The difference maker will be the defense, which allowed 30-plus points in four of their first fives games last season, resulting in an 2-3 record even with a healthy Prescott under center. But the Cowboys will be up against divisional opponents that all finished in the bottom half of the league last season in offensive statistics. The Cowboys defense does not need to be stellar, but it needs to do just enough to give the team the upper hand in division matchups. The offensive line lives up to expectations and allows Prescott to be dominant in his return. Meanwhile on defense, Diggs continues to improve in his second season while Joseph and Wright step up in a big way at cornerback. The defense improves enough as a unit to keep the Cowboys competitive in games. If Dallas can’t keep opposing offenses from running all over them and the secondary remains weak, the team is looking at its third straight missed postseason. The Cowboys could blame their absence from the postseason in 2020 on Prescott’s injury and McCarthy’s adjustment in his first year, but they are slowly running out of excuses.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilyiannaconi/2021/09/02/dallas-cowboys-nfl-season-preview-dak-prescott/,Dallas Cowboys Season Preview: Dak Prescott Is Pushing For The Playoffs
"The Jacksonville Jaguars are hoping quarterback Trevor Lawrence can help them reverse a decade of ... [+] losing. The Jaguars are set to begin their 27th NFL season, and for the most part, things haven’t gone well. Jacksonville has a 177-239 overall record (.425). The Jaguars have been to the playoffs just seven times. And Jacksonville has finished last in its division eight times, including four of the last five years. Things are even worse in the past decade, in which the Jaguars have gone 44-116 (.275) and have lost at least ten games in nine of ten seasons.  There’s reason for optimism, though, after Jacksonville selected potential franchise quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the top overall pick in April’s draft.  The Jaguars also hired Urban Meyer as their new head coach. Meyer won two national championships and never experienced a losing season during his 17 years as a college coach. This is his first NFL job, though, and few great college coaches have succeeded at the next level. Meyer has a creative offensive mind, and Lawrence was the most highly regarded college quarterback since Andrew Luck in 2012. So no matter what happens in their first year together, it won’t be dull. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Jaguars did what they could in free agency to turn around a defense that ranked in the bottom of virtually every meaningful category possible. Jacksonville’s biggest addition was adding former Seahawks’ cornerback Shaquill Griffin, who signed a three-year, $40 million deal with $29 million guaranteed. The Jaguars also tried beefing up their defensive line by adding Roy Robertson-Harris (Chicago), Malcolm Brown (New Orleans) and Jihan Ward (Baltimore) in free agency. Veteran wide receiver Marvin Jones was the top free agent signee on offense. Jones has 18 touchdown receptions and nearly 1,800 receiving yards the last two seasons with Detroit. Jacksonville’s biggest loss came in the preseason when first round rookie running back Travis Etienne suffered a Lisfranc injury and will miss the year.   Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Jaguars’ greatest strength should be Lawrence, who gives Jacksonville its first franchise quarterback since Mark Brunell nearly two decades ago.  Jacksonville’s wide receiver group isn’t elite, but it’s good enough to win with. DJ Chark eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving in 2019, Jones is as steady as they come, and second-year man Laviska Shenault had 58 catches as a rookie and could be poised for a breakout season. The cornerback group should also be a strength. Griffin is in his prime, while 2020 first round draft pick CJ Henderson and 2021 second rounder Tyson Campbell give the Jaguars a trio with terrific upside. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Jacksonville ranked 31st in the NFL last year with a paltry 18 sacks. The Jaguars improved their defensive line and will run a 3-4 scheme under new coordinator Joe Cullen. But for Jacksonville’s defense to make gains, it starts with getting to the quarterback. The tight end group ranks among the weakest in football and there’s not much depth at running back following Etienne’s injury. Offensive tackles Cam Robinson and Juwann Taylor have a lot to prove. In that case, so does Meyer who will try disproving the theory that college coaches can’t win in the NFL. Jacksonville Wins: 6.5 Over -130, Under -Even The Jaguars are coming off a dismal 1-15 season in which they dropped their final 15 games. Jacksonville’s average margin of defeat in those contests was 12.9 points per game. That continued a trend in which the Jaguars have bordered on awful for the past decade. In the last 10 years, Jacksonville has won six games, or fewer, a remarkable nine times. The Jaguars have averaged a dismal 3.8 wins per year in those seasons. So while the Meyer-Lawrence tandem brings hope, the roster still needs a lot of help. Bet: Under, -Even Andrew Luck holds the record for most wins in his rookie season, when he led the Colts to an 11-5 mark in 2012. That was a playoff-ready roster, though, that stumbled in 2011 after a neck injury to Peyton Manning. Many regard Lawrence as the best quarterback prospect since Luck, and perhaps he can reverse a decade of despair in Jacksonville. For that to happen, the defense must improve dramatically, the offensive line needs to take strides and Meyer must prove he can match wits with the Bill Belichick’s of the world. Nick Saban. Steve Spurrier. Lou Holtz. Butch Davis. Bobby Petrino. Many highly successful coaches have tried transitioning to the NFL, but failed miserably. Saban, widely considered the finest college coach of all-time, is the greatest example of this as he lasted just two years in the NFL. More coaches making the jump from college to pro have failed than succeeded. And Meyer certainly has his work cut out for him. Other concerns include sacking the quarterback (31st in 2020), stopping the run (30th) and running the ball (28th). If the Jaguars can’t make at least modest gains in those areas, it will be another long season in Jacksonville.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/02/jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-season-preview/,Jacksonville Jaguars Season Preview: Can Trevor Lawrence And Urban Meyer Produce A Winner?

The Browns won 17-13. (AP Photo/David Dermer) Six wins simply won’t cut it. That’s the closest thing to a “playoffs or bust” mandate from the New York Giants’ leadership, which, after going on a massive free-agent spending spree to add playmakers to a woefully understaffed offense and to beef up the defensive secondary and pass rush, is expecting a final win-loss record that hovers well north of the .500 mark this season. But nothing has come easy for the Giants, who enter the 2021 campaign with questions about their offensive line, quarterback and pass rush. The answers to these questions will go a long way toward determining how much the Giants will be able to build on their six-win total last year under head coach Joe Judge, who, despite the poor record, kept the team competitive and focused in an unprecedented year.   Who’s Come: WR Kenny Golladay, TE Kyle Rudolph, CB Adoree Jackson, Edge Azeez Ojulari Who’s Gone: DT Dalvin Tomlinson The Giants made good on their vow to add firepower on offense, bringing in Golladay, a legitimate X-receiver, and Rudolph, an established red-zone threat to help the offense in the two areas in which it lagged last season.  Meanwhile, on defense, the Giants are hoping that the addition of Jackson at cornerback gives them what they need to play more man coverage and that Ojulari, the rookie pass rusher, can help the pass rush turn those ""almost"" sacks into actual sacks. The loss of Tomlinson can go either way for the Giant. Tomlinson did a lot of the dirty work inside, taking on multiple blockers, which opened up gaps and lanes for guys like Leonard Williams to get home on the pass rush.  But with Tomlinson having departed to Minnesota in free agency, the Giants appear willing to roll with a rotation that will include Austin Johnson, Danny Shelton, and B.J. Hill to fill the void.  Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams If they are healthy—and right now cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is trying to shake off a mild ankle sprain suffered late in the summer—the Giants’ team strength is their defensive secondary, and it’s not even close. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham has a versatile group of players at cornerback and safety that should allow him to roll out different looks and create more favorable matchups.  More importantly, the expanded collection of defensive backs should let the Giants play a lot more man coverage than it did last year, a welcomed possibility, by the way, given all the track star type of receivers on the Giants’ 2021 schedule. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Many eyes will be on third-year quarterback Daniel Jones, and if he can take that anticipated step forward à la Josh Allen of Buffalo and Baker Mayfield of Cleveland, but unless the Giants offensive line delivers the goods, it won’t matter.  The Giants have decided to roll with their young offensive line where the majority of the starters—left tackle Andrew Thomas, left guard Shane Lemieux, center Nick Gates, right guard Will Hernandez, and right tackle Matt Peart— all have two years or less at their respective positions. The unit’s depth also took something of a hit this summer with the retirements of Joe Looney and Zach Fulton, but the Giants are expected to be active on the waiver wire. According to BetOnline.ag, the Giants’ projected over/under on season wins is seven games, one more than the six they posted last year. If the Giants stay healthy and the offensive line justifies the confidence it has from management, there’s no reason to go with the under this year.  That said, the Giants would need a few things to fall their way if they are to post their first double-digit-win season since 2016, when they went 11-5. If the Giants organization’s faith in the offensive line is rewarded and the offense takes the big step forward that’s expected, this team will fulfill ownership’s wish to rack up more wins. Besides the offensive line and quarterback Daniel Jones failing to take a step forward, there are questions about whether running back Saquon Barkley, receiver Kenny Golladay and tight end Kyle Rudolph can all recapture their pre-injury form. If they can’t, or have any setbacks, it might be more challenging for the Giants to reach their goals.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciatraina/2021/09/02/new-york-giants-nfl-season-preview/,New York Giants Season Preview: Demanding A Winning Season Despite Major Questions
"Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield will lead what should be one of the most prolific ... [+] offenses in the league, with above average players at every position. (AP Photo) Only four NFL teams have never been to the Super Bowl. One of them is the Browns, who have reached the playoffs only twice in this century. But a rapid two-year turnaround, orchestrated by general manager Andrew Berry and implemented by coach Kevin Stefanski, has produced arguably the NFL’s deepest and most complete roster, which stamps the Browns as legitimate Super Bowl contenders. The offense features above-average players at every position, including a handful of bona-fide stars. The defense was a problem last year, but Berry and Company appear to have filled all the holes through the draft and the aggressive use of free agency. The team is coming off a rousing 2020 season in which it went 12-5, reached the playoffs for the first time in 18 years, and won a playoff game for the first time in 24 years. Stefanski, a play-calling wizard who, as a rookie head coach, was voted NFL Coach of the Year last year, has the weaponry to produce an even more turbo-charged offense this year as his players get even more comfortable in his system. Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams General Manager Andrew Berry spent most of the off-season bolstering what was a shaky Browns defense last year, particularly in the secondary. Berry signed six free agent defensive players, then used his first two draft picks on defensive players. Berry’s two most expensive additions were safety John Johnson (3-years, $33.7 million) and cornerback Troy Hill (2-years, $9 million).  Berry also signed defensive ends Jadeveon Clowney (1-year, $8 million) and defensive end Takkarist McKinley (1-year, $4.2 million), plus defensive tackle Malik Jackson (1-year, $3.7 million). In the draft, the Browns used their first-round pick (No. 23 overall) on Northwestern cornerback Greg Newsome II. In the second round, with the 52nd overall pick, Berry selected Notre Dame linebacker Jeremiah Owusu Koramoah. Johnson will be one of the Browns’ starting safeties and Hill is competing for a starting spot at cornerback, but may see most of his action as a nickel back. Clowney slots into the defensive line opposite Myles Garrett, giving the Browns two elite pass rushers from the outside. McKinley will be in that rotation as well, while Jackson is a potential starter on the interior defensive line. Newsome is competing with oft-injured Greedy Williams for one of the starting cornerback spots, while Koramoah’s speed and nose for the ball should eventually lead to him becoming a starter at linebacker. The Browns also signed free agent inside linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. (1-year, $3 million), in addition to retaining three of their own free agents: receiver Rod Higgins (1-year, $2.3 million), a favorite target of Mayfield, plus linebacker Malcolm Smith (1-year, $1.2 million). Gone from last year’s team as free agents are offensive tackle Kendall Lamm to Tennessee (2-years, $6.8 million), cornerback Terrance Mitchell to Houston (2-years, $6.8 million), defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi to Cincinnati (1-year, $6.2 million), cornerback Tavierre Thomas to Houston (2-years, $4 million), and defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, who was waived and signed a one-year, $3.6 million deal with Minnesota. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams The Browns’ greatest strength is the depth of their roster. They are loaded everywhere. On offense it would not be a stretch to say that Cleveland has the best receivers group, the best running back depth – particularly the 1-2 punch of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt – led by what many observers feel is the best offensive line in the league. The receivers are led by Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr., who has made a complete recovery from the torn ACL he suffered in the middle of last season. Landry and Beckham are backed by a group of speedy youngsters that include Donovan Peoples Jones, Rashard Higgins, and rookie Anthony Schwartz, a world-class speedster who was the Browns’ third-round pick in the draft. Tight end Austin Hooper is a two-time Pro Bowl selection.  The offensive line, featuring tackles Jake Conklin and Jedrick Wills Jr., guards Wyatt Teller and Joel Bitonio, and center J.C. Tretter are as good as any group in the league. The man behind the wheel will be quarterback Baker Mayfield, who has the incentive of playing for a contract extension, while in his second season in Stefanski’s system, following a sensational first year. In the last 10 games of last season Mayfield completed 64 percent of his passes, threw 16 touchdown passes, with just two interceptions, and a 102.1 quarterback rating. The Browns defense should also be much improved, particularly up front, where defensive end Myles Garrett will be joined by new addition Jadeveon Clowney, who is on a one-year $8 million contract, and is playing for his next contract. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams There aren’t many. On paper, the Browns should be better than they were last year, when they were 12-5, counting the playoffs. The place-kicking situation bears watching. Last year’s kicker, Cody Parkey, was replaced by journeyman Chase McLaughlin, who in his two years in the league has played for five different teams. Most of the major sportsbooks have the Browns ranked eighth among NFL teams most-likely to win the Super Bowl. The consensus, in order, seems to be, Kansas City, Tampa Bay, Buffalo, Green Bay, Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco, Baltimore and Cleveland. Of that group, only three teams, Kansas City, Buffalo and Green Bay, had better records than the Browns’ 11-5 regular season mark last year. In the playoffs, Cleveland, with a bad defense, played Kansas City tougher (a five-point loss) than did Buffalo (a 14-point loss). The Browns’ massively-improved defense this year – they could have as many as nine new starters on that side of the ball – should be improved enough, coupled with its high-powered offense, to reach the Super Bowl for the first time in their history. There are no major injuries to key players, Stefanski’s high-powered offense, with weapons everywhere, overwhelms opposing defenses. General Manager Andrew Berry’s defensive overhaul brick walls opposing offenses, and the NFL’s most tortured fan base parties like it’s 1964 (the last time the Browns were NFL champions). A rash of major injuries to key players, Baker Mayfield takes a giant step backwards, Odell Beckham Jr. becomes a distraction again, the Ravens are even better than expected, the Steelers return from the grave, and the Browns’ Super Bowl drought continues.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimingraham/2021/09/02/cleveland-browns-nfl-season-preview/,Cleveland Browns Season Preview: Can A Deep Roster Finally End An Interminable Super Bowl Wait?
"This is likely to be the final year for Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. Can he go out a champion? One last ride. It appears that’s what the 2021 season will be for the Green Bay Packers and quarterback Aaron Rodgers. After a drama-packed offseason in which Rodgers let it be known he didn’t ever want to play for the Packers again, the disgruntled quarterback folded his cards and showed up for the start of training camp. Green Bay made concessions, such as voiding the 2023 season on Rodgers’ contract and agreeing to potentially trade the three-time MVP at the end of the 2021 campaign. That means the Packers — who have lost in back-to-back NFC Championship Games — will line up with largely the same group they had in 2020 and take another shot at a title. Considering the 2022 Packers will look dramatically different — and almost certainly won’t contain Rodgers — there’s a lot on the line in Green Bay this fall.  Related on Forbes.com: The Optimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Green Bay’s top addition figures to be inside linebacker De’Vondre Campbell, who signed a one-year, $2 million deal in June and immediately won an inside linebacker job. The only other newcomers to the starting lineup figure to be two rookie offensive linemen. Second round pick Josh Myers will start at center, while fourth round pick Royce Newman is expected to start at guard. Speedy first round cornerback Eric Stokes is also expected to contribute immediately. Green Bay’s biggest loss in free agency came when center Corey Linsley signed a five-year, $62.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Chargers that included $17 million fully guaranteed at signing. Linsley was arguably the best center in football last year, and Myers has enormous shoes to now fill. Others such as running back Jamaal Williams (Detroit) and linebacker Christian Kirksey (Houston) departed in free agency. But the Packers have players ready to step into those spots. Related on Forbes.com: The Pessimistic Outlook For All 32 NFL Teams Quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw 48 touchdowns last season, just five interceptions and won his third career MVP award. Rodgers broke his own team record for touchdown passes and finished the year with a 121.5 quarterback rating, giving him the top two marks in league history.  Rodgers completed 70.7% of his passes — his highest mark since becoming a starter in 2008. And his touchdown-to-interception ratio (9.6-to-1) was the second-best of his career (12.5-to-1 in 2018). Green Bay’s running back duo of Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon should form one of the best 1-2 punches in football. Jones has consecutive 1,000-yard seasons and is tied for second in the NFL the last two seasons with 30 total touchdowns. Dillon had just 46 carries, but averaged a robust 5.3 yards per carry as a rookie.  And Green Bay’s secondary is as deep and gifted as almost any in football. Jaire Alexander has become one of the top cornerbacks in football. Alexander had Pro Football Focus’ top coverage grade among cornerbacks in 2020, and had six games in which he held foes to 10 or fewer receiving yards.  Safety Adrian Amos had a career year in 2020 and finished as PFF’s top coverage safety. Third-year safety Darnell Savage is coming into his own and had four interceptions in his final six games. Related on Forbes.com: One Betting Line To Look At For All 32 NFL Teams Packers Pro Bowl left tackle David Bakhtiari will begin the year on the Physically Unable To Perform (PUP) list. That means left guard Elgton Jenkins moves to left tackle and the Packers will start two rookies (Myers and Newman) on the interior of their line. The Packers fired defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, despite the fact they finished ninth in total defense last year. That was Green Bay’s first top-10 defense since 2010. The Packers then hired Joe Barry, who flopped in Detroit in 2007-08 and in Washington in 2015-16 leaving many to wonder how Green Bay improved? The Packers also finished 29th in special teams rankings compiled by Rick Gosselin and fired coordinator Shawn Mennenga. To the surprise of many, the Packers then promoted from within, elevating assistant Maurice Drayton. Green Bay dumped inconsistent punter JK Scott and traded for strong-legged Corey Bojorquez. The Packers were dreadful returning kicks (31st) and punts (30th) last year, while allowing an NFL worst 17.1 yards per punt return. Aaron Rodgers Regular Season Interceptions: 6.5 Over -115, Under -115 This bet can be found at mybookie.ag. Rodgers has thrown just 11 interceptions in the last three years — an average of 3.67 per year. He had two in 2018, four in 2019 and five last year. Now in his third year with coach Matt LaFleur, Rodgers is in total control of the offense. He’s also thrown interceptions on just 1.4% of his career passes. Even with a 17th game this season, Rodgers should stay under this number. Bet: Under, -115 This largely comes down to Rodgers.  If he can put aside his differences with management and play near his 2020 MVP level, anything and everything is possible for this team. The running game is terrific, there are plenty of weapons in the passing game, and the secondary could be elite. If everything clicks, Green Bay has the potential to reach its first Super Bowl in 11 years. Rodgers has one eye on his 2022 home and plays like he did in 2018-19, a pair of mediocre seasons by his standards. The defense takes a step backwards under Barry, special teams remain a nightmare and the offensive line struggles. If any or all of that happens, ‘The Last Dance’ for Rodgers and these Packers will be one giant disappointment.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreischel/2021/09/02/green-bay-packers-nfl-season-preview-aaron-rodgers/,Green Bay Packers Season Preview: The Last Dance For Aaron Rodgers
