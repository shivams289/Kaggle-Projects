              "\" China's visa and international travel restrictions have helped to keep Covid-19 in check yet become ... [+] a source of frustration for American companies in the country. (Photo by NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images) A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China released Friday found that nearly two-thirds of respondents want the U.S. and the Chinese governments to restore visa services and travel channels for business executives and their dependents as their top priority this year.  “As the pandemic continues well into its second year, the priorities for our member companies remain consistent, with the resumption of business travel at the top of the list,” said AmCham China Chairman Greg Gilligan in a statement.  Other top priorities for member companies this year include regularized government-to-government\\xa0communication, and the removal of bilateral tariffs, the flash survey found.  “The state of the overall U.S.-China relationship is as important as ever to the business community, with members prioritizing concrete results and actions as a way to restore trust between the two countries,” Gilligan said.  The survey by Beijing-based Amcham China was conducted from August 23-25 to better understand how member companies perceive priorities for\\xa0U.S.-China relations, Phase One Agreement implementation, and the current situation with respect to\\xa0bilateral tariffs. Some 125 companies – of a total of nearly 1,000 members — submitted responses. The organization didn’t say which companies participated in the survey. Amcham China board members include include executives from Intel, Boeing, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs.  Other top issues include the removal of bilateral tariffs, restarting people-to-people exchanges, and a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping before year’s end.\\xa0The two spoke by phone on Thursday, the White House said (see statement here).
